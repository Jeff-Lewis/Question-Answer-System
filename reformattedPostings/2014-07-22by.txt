The latest inflation numbers are out, and they're good news for people who are worried about rising inflation. Core CPI — a measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices — rose just 0.1% for the month. This was down from the 0.2% that they grew in the previous month, and also down from the 0.2% that was expected. Headline CPI rose 0.2%, which was right in line with expectations. For stock market bulls, this is good news. The muted inflation reading adds no new pressure on Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen to increase interest rates sooner than expected. In previous months, core CPI had been ticking up rapidly, but Yellen referred to this gain as "noise," and this report helps bolster her view. Markets are ticking up on the news. Here's a look at the CPI by category breakdown. BLS FREE AppDownload
