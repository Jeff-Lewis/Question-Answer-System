Six of the seven restaurants that earned three stars — the guide's highest designation — in 2014 retained those rankings. They are Le Bernardin, Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, Eleven Madison Park , Jean Georges, Masa, and Per Se. Chef Daniel Boulud's Daniel was downgraded to two stars.  Three restaurants were elevated from one stars to two; they are Brooklyn's Blanca, Nordic-insired Aquavit, and Ichimura, known for its sushi and sashimi. There are 17 new restaurants on the one-star list, including two in Queens. Michelin's ratings are determined by anonymous food inspectors.    In anticipation of the New York guide, Michelin released its "bib gourmand" list for the city last week. That list includes the city's best affordable restaurants.
