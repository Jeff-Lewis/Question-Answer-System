REUTERS/Jim YoungIn the past five years passive investing and indexing have outperformed active investing. Charles Schwab appears to be capitalizing on this hot investment trend. Schwab has unveiled six new Schwab Fundamental Index ETFs will begin trading next week. These ETFs will track the Russell Fundamental Index Series. Market-cap weighted indexes are often criticized for focusing on popular stocks. The argument for fundamentally weighted strategies is that they are more objective and draw on fundamentals like adjusted sales, cash flow and so on. First a quick look at the six ETFs that will be available to investors commission-free, online in Schwab accounts starting August 15. "These ETFs add a new flavor to our ‘pure vanilla’ ETF market-cap line-up and further demonstrate our commitment to offering core products that help investors build their portfolios and potentially achieve better outcomes," Marie Chandoha, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM) said in a press release. The ETFs will be added to Schwab ETF OneSource platform. FREE AppDownload
