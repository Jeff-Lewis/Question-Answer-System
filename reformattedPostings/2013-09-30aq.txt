Screenshot Via YouTubeIt can be just as tough to get into some of the nation's most elite boarding schools as some top colleges—and cost just as much money.  We've rounded up the 50 most expensive boarding schools in the U.S., looking at total costs including tuition, room and board, and mandatory fees (including one-time fees where applicable) for the 2013-2014 school year. Special needs schools and daytime-only schools were not taken into consideration for this list. Every school on this list charges more than $50,000 a year to attend—money that goes towards living facilities, dining halls, and some fairly unbelievable perks. The majority of these are located in the northeast, with many in Massachusetts. California also makes the list several times with a handful of expensive progressive academies. If you think we missed a school, tell us in the comments and we'll check it out. FREE AppDownload
