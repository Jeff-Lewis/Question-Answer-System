Stuck in Customs / FlickrThe jobs number is out, and it's a big number! 236K new jobs came in WAY ahead of expectations of 165K. Unemployment fell to 7.7%, down from 7.9%. That was totally unexpected. This is a GREAT number. Private payrolls jumped 246K. That means that public sector cutting cost the US another 10K jobs this month. The full report is here. One really interesting sub-detail is the big spike in construction employment. Housing starts have been picking up for awhile, jobs in this area have been a little slow in coming. One interesting, and slightly negative aspect of the report, is that the labor force participation rate actually fell. FREE AppDownload
