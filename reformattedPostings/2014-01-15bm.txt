REUTERS/ Rebecca CookBank of American announced its fourth quarter earnings for 2013 this morning beats analyst estimates by $0.02 with an earnings per share of $0.29 and revenue at $21.7 Billion. Analysts expected an earnings per share to come in at $0.27 with a revenue of $21.1 billion. Shares are up 2% in premarket trading on this news. There are two major things Wall Street is waiting to see in this report — how the 'New BAC' plan of cost cutting that Brian Moynihan has championed is going, and how Bank of America's mortgage business. One crazy cost cutting fact for you — the number of employees at Bank of America is down 9% since New BAC started. An yesterday, we got a look at how the mortgage business is doing at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, and it wasn't great. Wells Fargo managed to get through it by cost cutting, but JP Morgan, weighed down with legal fees, disappointed the Street. Federal Reserve survey results showed weaker demand in both prime and on traditional mortgage loans this quarter, according to FactSet data, so this shouldn't be too surprising. Here's what CEO Moyninhan said in his letter accompanying earnings.
