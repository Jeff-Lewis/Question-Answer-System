David McNew / GettyOil is hovering around $60 a barrel, a 40% decrease in price since the height of summer. This is widely thought to be a supply issue, with the US producing far more oil than it traditional has, and OPEC refusing to cut production to stabilize prices. US Trust's chief market strategist Joseph Quinlan sent out a note this week showing just how much US energy production has expanded in the last five years. He writes: The ingredients of the U.S. energy revolution were threefold: (1) Pro-market policies at the state and local levels, combined with (2) revolutionary technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, and (3) good old American entrepreneurship and risk taking that upended the energy patch. By combining the three, the United States became the largest natural gas producer in 2013 and is on its way to becoming the world’s leading oil producer.
