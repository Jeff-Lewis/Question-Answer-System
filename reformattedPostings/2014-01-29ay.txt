REUTERSFor some investors, choppy waters, uncertainty, and volatility are just the price of rapid growth. Even more, they're a thrill. For these investors, Bloomberg Markets Magazine has compiled a list of the 16 most promising frontier markets on the globe. These are places where only investors like Mark Mobius (the Indiana Jones of investing, if you will) dare to tread.

Countries were then given a score of zero to 100, the maximum number of points for each category, to compute their overall score. FREE AppDownload
