"We would argue that the Korean won has become a ‘safe haven’ currency if commodity prices and the USD-KRW exchange rate continue to move in the same direction," writes Oh in a new report. "The resilience of the won since August this year, despite the weakness in many emerging market currencies, is another indication that the won is behaving like a typical safe haven currency." So what would be the implications for the Korean economy? "Of course, it is too early to make a firm conclusion: we should at least wait for a recovery in commodity prices and see whether the won weakens in that case," writes Oh in the note. Oh joins Morgan Stanley analysts, who also identified Korea as a "safe haven," writing recently, "Unlike the rest of the region, Korea is not seeing any risk of a property bubble. It is probably one of the very few economies in AXJ that could even see upside in its property prices in the next three years rather than the possible correction we may expect in other countries."
