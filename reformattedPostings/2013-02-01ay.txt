Foursquare/ William P.Fox Business News senior correspondent Charlie Gasparino told Cigar Aficionado recently that The Grand Havana Room is "one of the best places" to meet Wall Street sources.   We've been to the private cigar club located in the penthouse of 666 Fifth Avenue a few times before.  It's definitely a hot spot for those in high finance to relax and socialize with fellow members over cigars and drinks.  Of course, it's not just Wall Streeters who frequent the place.  Rev. Al Sharpton has also been spotted hanging out there, too.  Now let's take a photo tour of this members-only cigar club.  FREE AppDownload
