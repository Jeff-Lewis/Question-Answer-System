Markit EconomicsThe UK remains the global leader in PMI despite a slowdown in January.PMI day is over. Countries from around the world reported about how their manufacturing sectors performed in January. This was measured in their purchasing manager's index (PMI), a score created by the Institute for Supply Management that surveys executives in thousands of companies from the given country. The surveys also contain data about employment, new orders and productivity. We basically got a straight split down the middle between countries reporting accelerating growth, and those slowing or contracting further.  Here is the full scorecard and schedule.
