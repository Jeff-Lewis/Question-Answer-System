Japanese media said Abe will not visit the shrine, where 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal are honored along with Japan's war dead. Visits by Japanese leaders to the Tokyo shrine have outraged China and South Korea, which suffered under Japanese occupation and colonization in the 20th century. Beijing and Seoul have been highly critical of previous offerings made by Abe as well. Abe's latest offering comes just days ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama's three-day visit to Japan from April 23.
