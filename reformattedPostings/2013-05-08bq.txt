Paul Singer, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Elliot Management, believes there are still deadly, fundamental flaws in the global economy. Another Lehman moment, he writes in his latest letter to investors, could come upon us easily, as financial institutions are still holding massive books of derivatives, private equity, and other illiquid investments. Yes, Singer admits, banks are probably trying to decrease their positions in these assets, but we can't tell by how much based on the numbers they're reporting. One can only assess that the industry is still risky, opaque, and overleveraged. But, Singer still has faith that these problems can be fixed — that, if the governments around the globe collaborate to take certain measures, the system can be simplified. In his letter he lays out nine points for how that aim can be achieved. What Singer is proposing is an end to a global Too Big To Fail.  But it's not that he wants banks to be out on their own; quite the contrary. He sees that banks are a utility that may, from time to time, need government assistance. That's fine, he says, as long as they're making mark-to-market payments. If they're not, the banks will trigger a "termination event." Yikes! Here in the U.S., Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and David Vitter (R-LA) have proposed legislation to end Too Big Too Fail, but it's not nearly this comprehensive — where their bill is black and white (fail or no fail) Singer understands that there is a significant gray area. The only point where the Brown/Vitter bill directly agrees with Singer is on risk-weighted assets. Otherwise, Singer is on  a different plane, and it's something to consider. FREE AppDownload
