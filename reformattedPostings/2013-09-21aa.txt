Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's term at the head of the U.S. central bank is up in January, and the search is on at the White House to find his replacement. Though he will be remembered as a soft-spoken, unimposing, professorial figure, the Fed head has definitely had his moments. Bernanke took over the helm of the Fed in 2006. Only two years into his term, he presided over the worst financial crisis and ensuing recession in 80 years, and was forced to rely on experimental monetary policies that had never been tried before in an attempt to bring the American economy back to life. Luckily, Bernanke was relatively well-equipped to handle the situation, and in recent years has taken extraordinary action to stabilize markets and the economy.
