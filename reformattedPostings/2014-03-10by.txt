Flickr/SvadilfariUS fruit supplier Chiquita has bought Irish rival Fyffes, creating the world's largest banana company. The pair of fruit distributors has struck a stock-for-stock deal which will give Chiquita and Fyffes shareholders 50.7pc and 49.3pc of the new company respectively. US-headquartered Chiquita and Dublin-based Fyffes said their boards voted unanimously in favour of the deal, in a joint announcement on Monday morning. Both the Chiquita and Fyffes brands will continue, they said. The new company, ChiquitaFyffes, will be worth around $1bn (£600m). It will be listed in New York but based in Dublin. The pair said they hoped the merger would create $40m in pre-tax savings by the end of 2016. Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38pc over its Friday's closing price. David McCann, executive chairman of Fyffes, will become the new company's chief executive, while Ed Lonergan, Chiquita's boss, will become chairman. Chiquita is the larger of the two companies, valued at $507.7m (£303.7m) at Friday's closing price. This compares with Fyffe whose market capitalization stands at €264.7m (£220m). Mr McCann hailed the deal as "transformative", while Mr Lonergan dubbed it a "milestone transaction". "We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will help to ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies," added Mr Lonergan. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board and Lazard for Fyffes. Fyffes shares climbed 29pc in early trading.  FREE AppDownload
