TBIWeekly jobless claims figures are out. Initial claims fell to 331,000 in the week ended February 1 from an upward-revised 351,000 the week before, below consensus expectations for a smaller drop to 335,000. Continuing claims rose to 2.964 million in the week ended January 25 from a downward-revised 2.949 million in the previous week. Claims figures have been distorted over the past several weeks due to seasonal factors. "Following several months of volatility induced by computer problems in California, the federal government shutdown, and the holiday season, this week's print was likely a 'clean read'," says Guy Berger, a U.S. economist at RBS.
