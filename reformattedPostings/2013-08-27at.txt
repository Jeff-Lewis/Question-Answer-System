REUTERS/Andy ClarkDonald Trump addresses a ceremony announcing a new hotel and condominium complex in Vancouver, British Columbia June 19, 2013. Trump has put his name to the development to be called the Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver and to be built by TA Global Bhd. and the Holborn Group. New York is suing Trump University for alleged fraud. Until this weekend, when the suit was announced, most of us were probably unaware that there was such an institution. But for more than 5,000 Americans, it was a very real organization that NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says collectively cost them $40 million. We went back through the full complaint, and it basically sounds like an episode of "Seinfeld" (specifically, the one where Kramer recreates "The Merv Griffin Show" in his apartment using a set he found in the dumpster) crossed with a pyramid scheme. Here are the best and most cringeworthy allegations from the suit: For more than five years, the group allegedly ignored the warnings of  the New York State Education Department to correct its business practices and change its name (of note: state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli just issued a scathing report of that agency). And Trump U. has still never applied for a license to operate as an educational institution.
