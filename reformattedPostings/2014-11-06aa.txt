Loretta Mester, head of the Cleveland Fed, told reporters the central bank needs to be "forward looking" in deciding when to tighten policy based on inflation. She added that market volatility is to be expected as a rate-rise approaches.     (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) FREE AppDownload
