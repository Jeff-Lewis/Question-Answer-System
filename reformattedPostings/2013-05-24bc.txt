APThe automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that began on March 1 are hurting more than ever, according to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll. The poll finds that nearly four in 10 Americans say the cuts of the sequester have had a negative effect on them personally, which is up substantially from just 25 percent two months ago.  Among that group, self-identified Republicans say they have been most affected. An astounding 46 percent of Republicans have felt the effects of the sequester, compared with just 32 percent of Democrats. Perhaps unsurprisingly, just 39 percent of Republicans support the cuts, compared with 54 percent who oppose them. That's a significant change from a March WaPo/ABC poll, which found that only 27 percent of Republicans said they had been affected by the cuts. Among Republicans, the number of respondents who "strongly disapprove" of the cuts has climbed 8 percentage points in the past two months. Here's a look at the Republican difference in chart form: Brett LoGiurato/Business Insider (Data: ABC/Washington Post) Overall, only 35 percent of Americans approve of the cuts, compared with 56 percent who disapprove, making disapproval of the cuts an issue that goes across party lines. Congress hasn't felt any push to resolve the cuts since late April, when it quickly resolved a series of flight delays that were piling up across U.S. airports because of the cuts. But if personal displeasure with the cuts continues to fester, it could once again force Congress to explore alternative solutions. FREE AppDownload
