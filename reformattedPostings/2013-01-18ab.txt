Unfortunately, experts consulted by Canada's Globe And Mail say it's not a Canadian maple leaf.  Rather, it's Norwegian. However, The Bank of Canada disagrees.  From the Globe and Mail: “We created an image for the bank note that represents a stylized Canadian maple leaf, if you will, so that it wouldn’t represent any specific species, specifically not the Norway maple,” said spokeswoman Julie Girard. Ms. Girard said the bank worked with a botanist who specializes in trees. However, she declined to reveal the scientist’s name, citing privacy reasons.
