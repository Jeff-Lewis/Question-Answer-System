The July nonfarm payrolls report just came in well below expectations. 162,000 nonfarm payrolls were created in July, versus Wall Street's consensus estimate of a 185,000 gain. In the wake of the release, buyers are flocking to Treasuries, sending yields plunging. Yesterday was the worst day for the bond market since the release of the June nonfarm payrolls report nearly a month ago, but the surge immediately following today's release has already made up for all of yesterday's losses. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 8 basis points lower from yesterday's close at 2.63%. The chart below shows the move in 5-year U.S. Treasury futures. Thinkorswim FREE AppDownload
