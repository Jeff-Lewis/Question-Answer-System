Mike Monnelly and David Bonnier — two former analysts at Jim Chanos's Kynikos — have started a new short hedge fund based in London, Bloomberg's Bei Hu reports.  Bonnier joined Kynikos  in 2005. Monnelly joined in 2006. Their new enterprise — The Arhammar Short Alpha Fund — "will invest in 30 to 50 stocks which are expected to underperform the market," according to the report.

Examples of the boom-that-goes-bust theme include companies related to the subprime crisis of 2008 and the current China construction bubble, said Bonnier. Sounds like the two learned a lot from their former boss Chanos, who has been outspokenly bearish on China for years. Read the full report at Bloomberg » FREE AppDownload
