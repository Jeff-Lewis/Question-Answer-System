Flickr / Vermin IncGood morning!  It's a fairly quiet morning and markets are rising. The big event was the deflationary CPI number out of Spain, which is causing the euro to tank on a heightened chance that the ECB will engage in some kind of additional easing next week. Other than that, not much. German stocks are up 0.6%. The U.K. is up 0.4%. And U.S. futures are modestly green. Once again, the most interesting thing today will probably be to watch the U.S. momentum stocks — the tech and biotech darlings which have been getting clobbered as of late. Also today in the U.S. we get personal income and spending data, as well as the latest read of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan. FREE AppDownload
