The charges were brought as part of an investigation into the business dealings of Cristina's husband, former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin, accused of embezzling millions in public funds through his non-profit Noos Foundation. It will be the first time a member of the Spanish royal family sits in the dock. Princess Cristina and her husband have both denied wrongdoing.
