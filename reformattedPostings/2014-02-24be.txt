Do you consider yourself both a left-brain and a right-brain person? Do you geek out over Excel? Is your DVD or books collection alphabetized — or better yet, alphabetized and organized by genre and time period? Business Insider is looking for an experienced Project Manager with strong organizational skills to help manage the details of many multi-faceted campaigns simultaneously. This position will be part of BI Studios, which works with marketers on custom components of their advertising campaigns — everything from sponsor content and editorial sponsorships to custom ad units and other creative executions. The successful candidate will have about 3 years of project management experience at an agency, publisher, or other online media studio, have top-notch organizational skills (we can’t mention that enough), and know Excel, Basecamp, and other project management tools inside and out. The Project Manager will assemble content timelines; stay on top of deadlines; communicate with clients, vendors, and freelancers; process contracts and other paperwork; and make sure we are always on track to meet our goals in a timely and effective way. If you’re hyper-organized (there it is again), able to keep track of a million details at once, and an ace communicator, this is the job for you. There will also be ample opportunity to write, edit, and contribute ideas as part of the growing BI Studios team, so editorial experience and creative thinking are major pluses. To apply, please send your resume and a brief paragraph about why you should be considered for the Project Manager position to studiojobs@businessinsider.com. Thanks in advance for your interest.
