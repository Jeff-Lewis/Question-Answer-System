REUTERS/David McNew An unemployment line.Initial jobless claims fell to 280,000. Expectations were for claims to come in at 305,000, down from last week's revised reading of 316,000.  Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said: "With the exception of the week of July 19, when claims were distorted by the automakers' shutdowns, this is the lowest reading since May 2000." Shepherdson noted, however, that seasonal problems likely accounted for a "good part" of this week's decline. The four-week moving average of initial jobless claims fell back below 300,000 to 299,500, down 4,750 from last week's average. Continuing claims also fell to 2,429,000, down 63,000 from last week's revised level and the lowest level for continuing claims since May 19, 2007.   FREE AppDownload
