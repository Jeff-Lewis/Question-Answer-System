YouTube/TedxTalks Ian Bremmer is on BloombergTV this morning, and he's made the prediction that the Scottish independence vote on September 18 is going to be a decisive 'NO.' It's been long assumed that the independence referendum would not pass, but a new poll over the last weekend showed the 'YES' side leading for the first time.
