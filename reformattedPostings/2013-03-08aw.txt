APJust crossing the wires. Below is the full release. -------------------------------- Fitch Ratings has downgraded Italy's Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDRs is Negative. Fitch has simultaneously affirmed the Short-term foreign currency IDR at 'F2' and the common eurozone Country Ceiling for Italy at 'AAA'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade of Italy's sovereign ratings reflects the following key rating factors: The 'BBB+' rating reflects: RATING SENSITIVITIES The Negative Outlook reflects the following risk factors that may, individually or collectively, result in a downgrade of the ratings: The current Outlook is Negative. Consequently, Fitch's sensitivity analysis does not currently anticipate developments with a material likelihood, individually or collectively, of leading to an upgrade. However, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: Financing conditions have been relatively benign in recent months. The potential backstop of external support from the ESM and ECB reduces the tail risk of a sovereign liquidity crisis for Italy and is supportive of the rating. While it remains uncertain under what conditions Italy would apply for official assistance, the request itself would be neutral for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS The rating incorporates Fitch's assumption that the medium-term fiscal trajectory and commitments made by Italy under the Stability and Growth Pact and implied by the constitutional balanced budget amendments will be sustained by any new government. Fitch assumes that Italy will start recovering in H213 from its deep recession as the large shocks causing the current recession (fiscal consolidation, tight financing conditions, and weak external demand) gradually fade away. Fitch assumes that the contingent liabilities from the banking sector for the Italian government are limited. Nonetheless, if the recession is deeper and longer than currently anticipated, the risk that the government may be required to make further injections of capital, beyond the Monte dei Paschi recapitalisation, cannot be discounted. Fitch maintains its assumption that medium-term potential growth is 1% even in light of structural reforms adopted over the last two years. The current rating reflects Fitch's judgement that Italy will retain market access and, if needed, EU intervention would be requested and provided to avoid unnecessary strains on sovereign liquidity. Furthermore, Fitch assumes there will be progress in deepening fiscal and financial integration at the eurozone level in line with commitments by euro area policy makers. It also assumes that the risk of fragmentation of the eurozone remains low.
