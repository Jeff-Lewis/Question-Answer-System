REUTERS/Mukesh GuptaIndia's inflation rate hit a six-month high of 6.1% in August. Food prices were up 18.2% on the year, and this was led by a mind-blowing 245% annual rise in onion prices. Food costs account for a significant portion of the Indian people's income, and onions are a critical ingredient in most every Indian meal. This explains why officials are wary of rising onion prices.
