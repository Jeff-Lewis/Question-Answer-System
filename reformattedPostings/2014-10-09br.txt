In How the Rich Get Rich I shared information gleaned from the 400 Individual Tax Returns Reporting the Largest Adjust Gross Incomes that showed how the top 400 earned their money in 2009. (To you and me 2009 was a long time ago but to the government is pretty up to date.) Of course information found on tax returns can be just one version of reality. A report compiled by the Spectrem Group on the 132,00 people in the U.S. with a net worth of over $25 million details how the wealthy say they made their money. So to what do they attribute their success? Obvious conclusions: Let's see: hard work. Education. Taking risks. Prudent spending. Being in the right place at the right time. Creating your own success. Sound like an entrepreneur? Sure does. FREE AppDownload
