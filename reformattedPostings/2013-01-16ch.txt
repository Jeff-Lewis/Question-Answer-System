Since I already provided 5 reasons to remain cyclically bullish I figured I’d offer the other side of the coin as well.  Here’s 6 downside risks via Deutsche Bank: 1.  US – failure to raise debt ceiling: political deadlock, government shutdown, weak confidence hurts growth. 3.  Global growth weakens on spill over from a shock in one economic region: e.g., EM lags amid failure to reform, Europe fails to return to growth, slowdown in the US. 4.  Disorderly sell-off in core rates: concern over excess money printing leads to a bond and risk asset sell-off . 5.  China – non-performing loans: rising NPL’s on bank balance sheets constrain credit availability and growth. 6.  Middle East tensions escalate and push up oil prices.
