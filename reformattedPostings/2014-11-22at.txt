JP Morgan, BEA, Federal Reserve, S&amp;P Credit was seizing, business stopped producing, people were losing jobs, and the Dow was dropping by 700 points a day. But six years later, not only has the darkness passed, but the economy has actually flourished. In a new research note, JPMorgan Research analysts chart six economic indicators from before the financial crisis to today — and things are looking good. Five out of the six indicators (corporate profits, stock prices, household net worth, GDP, and business investment) have not only reached their pre-crisis highs, but they have actually surpassed them. "Since the bottom of the economic cycle in June 2009, the US economy has expanded by 20.7% with new highs in economic output and corporate profit margins," according to the report. "US equities since the beginning of economic expansion have risen 19.3% annualized, while earnings have risen 61.2%," and credit fixed income "has risen 13.8% annualized over the same time frame, bringing yields down to new low and spread versus Treasuries back to around their tightest ever levels." And on top of all that, M&amp;A activity is back to 2007 peaks, and capital expenditures have grown by 58% over the past five years. The only indicator that has yet to fully rebound is employment (as measured by the employment-to-population ratio). We still haven't reached the January 2007 high.   FREE AppDownload
