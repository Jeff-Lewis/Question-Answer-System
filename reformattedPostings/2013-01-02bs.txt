However, almost all of them said that their targets would likely change depending on the outcome of the fiscal cliff dealings. Well, now we have a deal, and Wall Street is cranking up its forecasts. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco just raised his year-end target from 1,500 to 1,575. From his note to clients this morning: Fiscal cliff deal done: 12-month S&amp;P target raised to 1575 from 1500Congress passed legislation to avert the fiscal cliff on New Year's Day. Although the deal only covers taxes and pushed the spending issues off for a couple of months, we are pleased that it kept the top dividend and capital gains tax rates low and equal at 23.8%. The dividend tax rate was our chief focus and it staying equal to the capital gains rate puts 1600 within 12-month reach, in our view. But because spending cuts must still be addressed per sequestration and the debt ceiling and also because the tax hikes are right at our ~1.25% tolerance level for confidence in 1H growth, we raise our 12-month S&amp;P 500 target from 1500 to 1575. Bianco's new target implies a 9 percent gain from where the S&amp;P 500 is trading today. FREE AppDownload
