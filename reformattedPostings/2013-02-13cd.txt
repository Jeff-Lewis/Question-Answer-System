APPresident Barack Obama laid out a sweeping blueprint for economic growth in his State of the Union, unveiling an ambitious liberal agenda that he promised would deliver a "growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs."  Picking up on the assertive tone of his second inaugural address, Obama outlined a package of policy proposals Tuesday, arguing that his plans would create jobs by increasing public investment in manufacturing, clean energy, infrastructure, and education.  "It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class," Obama said. "A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts."  Despite these lofty ambitions, however, most of the proposals that Obama put forward to Congress Tuesday night are likely D.O.A. The political reality is that Obama begins his second term amid high partisan tensions. Republicans control the House of Representatives, and are disinclined to help their White House rival achieve his domestic policy goals; meanwhile, Obama has been ineffective as a dealmaker, and his administration's relationships with Hill lawmakers — including Democrats — have been notoriously fraught.  On top of that, Obama's aggressive economic agenda offers little room for legislative compromise with Republicans. Here's a breakdown of some of his key proposals:  In the end, the President's policy proposals are bold ideas that seem doomed to remain just that. And despite his renewed, and lengthy, focus on economic issues Tuesday, Obama did next to nothing to advance the debate over growth, job creation, and government spending.   FREE AppDownload
