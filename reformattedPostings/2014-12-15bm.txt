"The residual financial effects of recession-driven job losses and subsequent unemployment have impeded millennials' entry into the home-owning market," writes Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com. "In 2015, increases in employment opportunities will empower younger buyers to return to the market and fuel the continued housing recovery." Realtor.com recently released its list of "Top 10 Markets for Housing Growth in 2015." These cities have a great deal of new construction, and their job markets are attractive to young professionals.
