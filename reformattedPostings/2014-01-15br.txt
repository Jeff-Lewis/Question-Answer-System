REUTERS/ Brendan McDermidThere's two interesting economic data points coming out today. From Calculated Risk: • At 8:30 AM, the NY Fed Empire Manufacturing Survey for January. The consensus is for a reading of 3.3, up from 1.0 in December (above zero is expansion).• Also at 8:30 AM, the Producer Price Index for December. The consensus is for a 0.4% increase in producer prices (and 0.1% increase in core PPI). PPI is frequently a snooze, but one of the questions for 2014 is whether inflation will start to re-assert itself a bit, so this one's worth watching. And the regional Fed surveys are always fun to watch. FREE AppDownload
