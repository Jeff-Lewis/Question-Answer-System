GDP reports are usually not too interesting as they are backward-looking stats, most of which are revealed through other monthly reports. Nevertheless, everyone is interested to see what number the U.S. managed to crank out after an unexpected 2.9% rate of plunge in Q1. Meanwhile, we'll also get a ton of manufacturing reports from around the world and from within the U.S. Also, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets on Tuesday and Wednesday to mull over monetary policy. Also, Pfizer, American Express, Exxon Mobil, Colgate-Palmolive, Time Warner Cable, and Valeant Pharma are among the companies announcing Q2 financial results this week.

"This makes the near-term risk/reward less attractive despite our strong conviction that equities are the best positioned asset class over 12 months, where we remain overweight." "Growth has improved substantially," they wrote. "Most of the acceleration we had expected is now behind us, but we expect growth to be sustained at current or slightly higher levels, with the U.S. growing at around 3% through 2017. We think the likelihood of a rise in government bond yields has increased and see this as a key aspect of the near-term macro outlook."
