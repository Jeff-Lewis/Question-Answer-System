Henry Blodget / Business InsiderA well-endowed company was kind enough to invite me to speak at a conference in Arizona recently. They put me up at the Ritz Carlton Dove Mountain, which is a luxury resort built in the middle of a desert. They gave me the key to my "room," which I soon discovered was actually a suite. I didn't get to spend too much time in the suite, unfortunately, because the conference was great. But I certainly enjoyed the time I did spend there!
