OWN We hosted a school potluck at our house last night, but at 9pm, I was able to sneak into a bedroom and watch the Lance Armstrong interview. Here are some thoughts: Bottom line, it was a weird interview. Armstrong took responsibility for a lot of what I hoped he would take responsibility for. But if part of the point of publicly coming clean is to ask people to forgive him and start to root for him again, it doesn't seem like he's mentally and emotionally where he needs to be. It is just not okay to use your vast wealth and power to try to destroy friends and colleagues for doing nothing more than telling the truth about you. It is just not okay to sue so many former colleagues (who are telling the truth) that you can't even remember whether you sued one person in particular. (Armstrong assumed he had sued Emma O'Reilly, a former team trainer, because "we" sued so many people, but he didn't remember that suit in particular). It is just not okay to lie repeatedly, indignantly, and under oath and then not convey some regret or explanation for that. So it sounds to me as though Lance Armstrong still has a ways to go before he really understands why so many people are so pissed at and disappointed with him. Given that he has already had many years to think about it, I wonder if he ever will. SEE ALSO: Betsy Andreu Unloads On Lance Armstrong After His Bizarre Interview FREE AppDownload
