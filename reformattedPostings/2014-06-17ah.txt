ODA ArchitectureThis ultra luxurious penthouse in Manhattan belongs to an extremely private billionaire. The 18,000-square-foot apartment, located a whopping 90 stories high, was recently redesigned by ODA Architecture. It contains nearly every amenity you can think of, including a sculpture garden with a 30-foot water wall and reflection pool, a game room, a day spa, and a recording studio, according to ODA. The penthouse's extensive renovations reportedly took ODA four years to complete.   FREE AppDownload
