REUTERS/Brendan McDermidTesla is up over 6% today rising to as high as $104 per share at one point. The stock is up 204% year-to-date. Some have argued that this drive up in prices is unwarranted. Goldman Sachs' Patrick Archambault has a neutral rating on Tesla with a price target of $61. Archambault recently visited Tesla's manufacturing plant in Fremont, California. Here are the key takeaways from the report: In recent weeks, Tesla has rallied on the back of an earnings beat, a secondary offering, a Consumer Reports review of 99/100. But some argue that this is just a short squeeze, and there are many long-term questions about gross margins, credit sales, and warranty accruals that need to be addressed.  FREE AppDownload
