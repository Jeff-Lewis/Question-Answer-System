Mazrouei said the sharp drop in prices will impose a "major economic burden" on oil producing countries, insisting nonetheless that OPEC's decision last month to maintain output levels was "correct." "OPEC's decision, which aims to provide the market with time to rebalance, is correct, strategic and useful to the global economy," he said at the forum organised by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC decision will "lead to stability in oil prices," he said. World prices have fallen almost 50 percent since June, mainly due to a supply glut, the weak global economy and a strong US dollar.
