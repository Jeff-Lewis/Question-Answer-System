New home sales climbed a more modest 3.6% to 455,000 units, down from the initial reading of an 8.3% rise to 497,000 units. The median sales price of new homes sole in July was $257,200, while the average sales price was $322,700.  There was a huge jump in housing inventory. There were a seasonally adjusted 171,000 new homes for sale at the end of July, which represents 5.2 months supply at the current sales pace. This compares with 4.3 months supply in June.
