"When asked 'has the fiscal policy impasse in Congress caused you to scale back or eliminate spending?' 40% of 1,000 consumers surveyed responded it had, with 28% indicating 'a little' and 12% 'considerably'," writes Mann in a note to clients. "Of note, 47% of respondents with household income &lt;$35k indicated they felt impacted, compared to only 32% of respondents earning &gt;$100K per household." Two weeks of government shutdown have helped erase two years of consumer confidence gains, as high-frequency measures of sentiment like Gallup's daily Economic Confidence Index have plummeted since the beginning of October. Yesterday, Goldman published the results of a separate, quarterly survey of 2,000 consumers. The report said the disparity in sentiment toward the economy between low- and high-income households in the third quarter was the largest in the history of the survey, which began 2005. Spending patterns in Q3 reflected the widening divergence in sentiment — high-income houses spent more, while low-income households pared back. FREE AppDownload
