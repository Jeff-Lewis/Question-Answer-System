Facebook has become totally unusable to me. There are a small number of people I don't communicate with every day - but who are old friends or were friends and I want to keep the option of re-contacting. Also family. Having 250 plus Facebook friends who met me professionally or through this blog eventually made Facebook meaningless. I didn't use it any more. Besides I don't really have 300 friends and nor do most of you. And I don't really know the 3000 people in my Google contacts. So, dear readers, I unfriended you all. Strangely though not a single person contacted me and wondered why I had unfriended them... In other words nobody noticed and cared.* Facebook revenue is still rising fairly fast. Relevance is another matter. John No position in the stock. Was long a while ago - but stuffed the timing up for small profits. *That nobody cared of course can be taken both ways. Maybe I should go back to self-loathing... FREE AppDownload
