Thomson ReutersThe American Apparel factory headquarters is pictured in Los Angeles(Reuters) - Struggling retailer American Apparel Inc  named Google Inc  executive Laura Lee as the second woman director on its board. Lee is head of East Coast content partnerships for Google/YouTube. The company, which for years aired racy ads and battled sexual harassment lawsuits, last month appointed Colleen Brown, former Fisher Communications Inc chief executive, in a board reshuffle. American Apparel is still looking for a replacement for its CEO and founder Dov Charney, who was suspended for allegedly misusing corporate funds and helping spread nude photos of a former employee. The hipster retailer on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the second quarter ended June 30 and said it was delaying filing its full financial results as its new board needed additional time to review them.
