Our friends at College Prowler created an exclusive list of American schools where the students are both hot and smart. College Prowler ranks schools based on input from real students at the schools. They have more than 700,000 student reviews on nearly 7,000 schools. To compile this list, they considered schools that students said have the hottest students and the smartest students, and averaged those lists together. These rankings were based on approximately 120,000 hot/smart data points taken from about 370,000 surveyed college students. We've included some comments that students posted on College Prowler about the schools. FREE AppDownload
