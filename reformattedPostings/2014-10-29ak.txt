AP/Fernando VergaraDeutsche Bank's David Bianco thinks stocks go higher from here as long as a few conditions are met. "The S&amp;P should climb to 2000 or higher by yearend if confidence remains solid in at least low single-digit EPS growth next year," Bianco wrote on Sunday. His forecast for 4.5% year-over-year earnings growth in 2015 assumes oil at around $85 per barrel and the Euro falling to $1.20 by the end of 2015. Bianco's research note included a list of 50 large-cap stocks to buy now. They're all rated Buy by Deutsche bank's analysts. They all have PE ratios below 22, expected earnings growth rates above 3%, and market caps above $10 billion. FREE AppDownload
