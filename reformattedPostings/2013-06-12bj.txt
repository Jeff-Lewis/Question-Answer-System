Earlier, we tweeted out our chart of the day: the sharp rise in real interest rates in the United States, which has sparked a rally in the dollar, selloff in several currencies, and a selloff in bond markets all around the world. The fact that real rates are what is driving the bond market sell-off is very telling, which leads us to the most important tweet you will see this month, from Izabella Kaminska over at FT Alphaville: @TheStalwart And that means.... goodbye inflation. The most important tweet you will see this month RT"@izakaminska: @TheStalwart And that means.... goodbye inflation." The nominal interest rate – the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, say, which has been flying higher in recent weeks as bonds have sold off – is the sum of real rates and inflation. Pseudonymous macro strategist Barnejek points out that although real rates are rising, inflation expectations are not, which means the sell-off in the bond market is not about concerns over rising inflation due to expansionary Federal Reserve policy. (That's one of the favorite criticisms of the Fed: all of the "easy money" stimulus from quantitative easing will eventually unleash massive inflation in the U.S. economy.) On the contrary, inflation remains very low – below even the Federal Reserve's target. In other words, the Fed is failing to create inflation. @TheStalwart @izakaminska This sell off is due to increasing real yields and NOT inflation expectations. These are actually coming off. Thus, the rise in real rates suggests just the opposite: inflation really seems to be dead, now. The upward move in U.S. real rates marks a sharp reversal from the long downward trend they have taken over the past several years. If this trend continues, it will be a game-changer, and we're already seeing that play out in financial markets around the world. FREE AppDownload
