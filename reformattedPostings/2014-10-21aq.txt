Morgan's huge credit derivative losses in 2012, including limited resources and competing priorities. J.P. Morgan &lt;jpm.n&gt; incurred around $2 billion in losses due to a complex trading strategy involving credit derivatives in Europe that year, in a case that became known as the London Whale. The Fed's Office of Inspector General said in a report released on Tuesday that among the flaws in the New York Fed's handling of the issue was limited resources and an over-reliance on certain personnel. The report also said that New York Fed examiners identified London Whale risks as early as 2008 but did not conduct planned follow-up examinations.   (Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
