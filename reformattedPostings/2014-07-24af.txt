For the quarter, Visa earned $2.17 per share, better than the $2.10 that was expected by analysts, on revenue of $3.16 billion, beating expectations for $3.15 billion.  Following the report, Visa shares were down 2%. Visa CEO Charlie Scharf said the company's earnings grew, "in the face of a continued, subdued global economy." At more than $222 per share, Visa is the largest segment of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the index is "price-weighted," meaning its components are weighted by the price of their stock, giving the heaviest weighting to the most expensive members.  For its fiscal-year 2014, Visa expects revenue growth of 9%-10% and earnings per share growth in the 17.5%-18.5% range.  FREE AppDownload
