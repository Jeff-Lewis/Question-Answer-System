The Russell P/E is significantly higher than the S&amp;P 600’s current reading of about 18 because it includes more stocks of companies that either have no earnings or are losing money. Yet investors are willing to pay high prices for them, expecting that they will eventually have great earnings. These great expectations more often than not end very badly once these companies actually start earning money. When they do so, it becomes obvious how dangerously overvalued these stocks are, especially if growth expectations turn more realistic and less fanciful. By the way, while the forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 was 15.5 during March, the median forward P/E was 16.6. This indicates that the larger-cap stocks are more fairly valued in the S&amp;P 500 than the smaller-cap ones in this universe of LargeCaps. Back during 1999, the reverse was true.
