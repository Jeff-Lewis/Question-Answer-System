Overnight, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe introduced the "third arrow" of Abenomics: the structural reforms crucial to the stimulus program's ultimate success. Stocks did not respond well. The Japanese Nikkei fell a whopping 3.8% on Wednesday. After rallying a bit after the close, Nikkei futures are heading lower again in after-hours trading and are close to their lows following the May 22 closing high of 15,670. Right now, futures are trading at 13,000, down 17% from the peak and only three more percentage points away from officially entering a bear market. FINVIZ.com FREE AppDownload
