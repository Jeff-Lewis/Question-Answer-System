REUTERS/ Kim Kyung HoonGet back here!Weakening demand for servers and storage equipment dragged IBM earnings south, and the stock is down 3% this morning. While the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are barely in the green, the Dow Jones Industrial Average — a price-weighted index in which stocks with higher per-share prices move the index around more — is in the red, basically thanks to IBM alone. IBM is acting as a 34 point drag on the Dow right now. This same kind of thing happened yesterday too, when three stocks (Travelers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Verizon) pulled the Dow down after earnings even though other indices were up. Once again, the Dow is weird and people tend to hate it. FREE AppDownload
