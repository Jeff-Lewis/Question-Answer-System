The analysts at Goldman Sachs have just published their latest Hedge Fund Trend Monitor report, which tracks the equity investments of the world's hedge funds. One thing is clear: hedge funds are struggling to keep up with the market. "The typical hedge fund generated a YTD return of 5% through May 10, compared with 15% gains for both the S&amp;P 500 and the average large-cap core mutual fund," wrote Goldman Sachs Amanda Schneider.  "Hedge funds returned an average of 3.5% in 1Q 2013, lagging the S&amp;P 500 by 700 bp. Last year the average fund returned 8% vs. 16% for the S&amp;P 500." We recognize that not all hedge funds are out their to beat these benchmarks.  Furthermore, five months is certainly too short a period of time to judge performance. Nevertheless, this only supports the argument that most investors are much better off sitting in a boring, low-cost index fund. Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
