Good news, Moms and Dads: kids are finding other ways to pay for college these days. A new study by student lender Sallie Mae shows "free money", such as scholarships, grants and financial aid have become the biggest source of college funding. Back in 2009, scholarships and grants accounted for just 25% of college funding. That figure is up 5 points today, accounting for 30% of college costs, according to the report, "How America Pays for College 2013."  The trend is likely giving cash-strapped parents a much-needed break. Students used to rely on mom and dad for more than one-third of college costs in 2010. Now, parents make up just 27% of funding. Families still see the value in college education (85% of parents and 95% of student say it's a worthy investment) and they've taken great pains to adapt to rising tuition and fee costs across the country. We've culled the entire report and picked out charts that paint the clearest picture of how Americans are affording higher education these days.  -- Sallie Mae  How America Pays For College Sallie Mae   "How America Pays For College" "How America Pays For College"  Looking for scholarships you  might qualify for?
