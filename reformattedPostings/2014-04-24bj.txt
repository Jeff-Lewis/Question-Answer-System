Reuters/Eric MillerAn artist's rendering of Tim Cook splitting Apple's stock.Last night Apple announced a 7-for-1 stock split. It was pretty unexpected. In 2012 Tim Cook told shareholders he didn't think stock splits did much. He reportedly said they provide a short-term bump, but in the long run they don't do much to change things.  On last night's earnings call, Cook explained why the company decided to do a split: We are taking this action to make Apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on June the 2nd, 2014 will receive six additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record day and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June the 9th, 2014. The key phrase here is "accessible to a larger number of investors." Apple shares are currently trading at about $570, which makes them expensive to retail mom-and-pop investors.  Anecdotally, I've had people tell me they would buy Apple shares but it's too expensive to buy one share.  Splitting the stock makes it cost about $81 per share, which is much more affordable for small investors.  (This is not entirely rational since people will have to pay a commission on each share they buy, thus driving up the price. But people aren't rational.) Cook is probably sick of Apple shares being bought by big institutions and hedge funds and wants to make the stock available to the people who buy iPhones. It could lead to a valuation bump as people go to buy Apple stock just as they buy iPhones.  Another benefit of the stock split is that Apple will likely be added to the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow didn't include Apple in the past because its share price was too high.  FREE AppDownload
