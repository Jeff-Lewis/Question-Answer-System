Markit's August PMI came in at 58.0, beating expectations for a 55.7, and is the highest reading for the index in four years.  Following that report, Markit's Tim Moore said: "Overall, with job hiring gathering momentum and input buying expanding at the sharpest pace for at  least seven years, it seems US manufacturers are increasingly confident that the recovery is firmly back  on track and are gearing up for a sustained rebound in production schedules over the months ahead." Following both reports, Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said, "The latest batch of US activity surveys is broadly consistent with annualized GDP growth of around 3.5% in the third quarter."
