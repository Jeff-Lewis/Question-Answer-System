The company also named Hassan Natha, a former Nike Inc executive, as chief financial officer. American Apparel fired Charney in June, citing alleged misuse of corporate funds and his role in disseminating nude photos of an ex-employee who had sued him. Brubaker replaces John Luttrell, who is resigning from the company. Luttrell had been serving as both interim CEO and CFO.
