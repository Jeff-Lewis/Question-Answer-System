StreetEasyApollo Global Management Founder Leon Black and his wife, Debra, are "hammering out the details" to buy a $50 million townhouse on the Upper East Side, according to the New York Post. Previously, the apartment was the Knoedler &amp; Company art gallery, although it was shut down in 2009 after a scandal involving art fraud. In 2013, Christian Candy, a British luxury property developer, bought the apartment for $35 million. He refurbished the townhouse and put it back on the market for $55 million. The townhouse was originally built in 1909. It has 20,757 square feet and seven stories. FREE AppDownload
