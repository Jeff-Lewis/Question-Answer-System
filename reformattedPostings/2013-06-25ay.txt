Reuters/ Mike SegarPrivate equity goddess Lynn Tilton regrets that time she mailed out Christmas cards to her clients of her wearing red lace lingerie (See image here). "In 1998, I was retiring, or at least I thought I was retiring. And for many years I had been on Wall Street with men asking me the color of my underwear on most days.  And so on my way out the door I sent out a Christmas card to my ten best customers in red lace and a Santa hat wishing them a 'Merry Christmas.'  The moral of the story is there is no end game and things live on forever.  I don't think I would do that today given what I tried to accomplish, but I own it. The important thing is whatever you do in life, own it," Tilton said in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal. Now that's settled.  FREE AppDownload
