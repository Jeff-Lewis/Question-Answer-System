Over the past week, following the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to refrain from tapering quantitative easing last Wednesday, bond funds snapped their 8-week streak of outflows as investors piled $4.5 billion into the asset class, the largest weekly inflow in five months. Meanwhile, equity funds saw $1.5 billion in outflows. U.S. equity funds in particular were hit hard, losing $7.4 billion to redemptions. Europe, however, remained hot, as investors poured another $2.3 billion into European equities.
