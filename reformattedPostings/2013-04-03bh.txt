Henry Blodget / Business InsiderThe hottest new attraction in the United Kingdom these days is not a royal palace or some rocks in a field. It's the studio in Leavesden where Warner Bros. spent ten years making the Harry Potter movies. A converted factory that was once used to make planes in World War II, Leavesden is still a working studio. But a big portion of it has been transformed into a gigantic show-and-tell Harry Potter sound stage exhibit. About 5,000 people a day make the trek to Leavesden, which is a half-hour northwest of London. They pay about $30 apiece to get in. That means that Warner is coining ~$50 million a year from Harry Potter studio tours from ticket prices alone. (And you're not going to leave with just a ticket — believe me.) My family is way into Harry Potter, and we were in London last week. So, of course, we went. It was awesome.
