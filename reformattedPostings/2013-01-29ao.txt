Executives have been known to visit Marine (any service really) bases to get barked at by drill instructors, put through obstacle courses, or taught leadership skills. Jim Michaels, a journalist with USA Today and a former Marine, covered one of these events at Quantico recently: a group of execs attending a three-day course meant to impart attendees with basic leadership principles and get them a little dirty. On the flip side, Marines and other services get an opportunity to familiarize civilians with military culture. Attendees included a vice president of operations and supply for Wells Enterprises, a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley, a senior vice president at the food company Wells and many more — all "undergoing a leadership program at the Georgia State J. Mack Robinson School of Business." I recommend reading Michaels' whole post here.
