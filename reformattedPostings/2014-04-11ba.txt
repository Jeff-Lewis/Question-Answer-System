AP There are plenty of legendary addresses in New York City, but 15 Central Park West stands out. The ultra-luxury condominium on the corner of West 61st St. and Central Park West has been home to a long list of bankers, celebrities, and assorted bold-faced names, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Sting. Author Michael Gross, who recently released a history of the condo called "House of Outrageous Fortune," calls it the world's most powerful address. Unlike many of New York's history-filled apartment buildings — especially its main rival across the park — 15 Central Park West is a relative newcomer. Completed in 2008 by developers Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, it offers a ridiculous array of amenities to New York's moneyed elite, including an in-house chef, a skylighted lap pool, and a private screening room.
