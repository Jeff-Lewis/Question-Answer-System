REUTERS/Jas Lehal Fireworks explode over the illuminated BT Tower in London October 31, 2009. French networking company Alcatel-Lucent and BT, the firms behind the joint-test, said speeds of 1.4 terabits per second were reached, the equivalent of sending 44 uncompressed HD films in a single second. The test proves that greater amounts of data can be sent through the existing broadband structure than previously achieved, allowing internet service providers (ISPs) to increase their capacity without the need for expensive upgrades. Conducted over the 255 mile distance between London's BT tower and Ipswich between October and November last year, the test made use of existing fibreoptic cables already installed in much of the country. Researchers used a 'flexigrid' infrastructure to create an 'alien super channel', consisting of seven channels each transmitting 200 gigabits per seconds, combining in a total capacity of 1.4 terabits of data per second. This results in a 42.5 per cent increase in data transmission efficiency compared to the current standard of broadband networks available. However, customers are unlikely to benefit from the greatly increased speeds for at least several years. Kevin Drury, optical marketing leader at Alcatel-Lucent, told the BBC the development was similar to increasing the amount of lanes available to traffic during rush hour. The Government recently announced a £10m fund to pilot alternative broadband technologies in Britain's most rural areas in the hope that 95 per cent of the UK will be connected to superfast broadband by 2017.
