As we've been pointing out, this is a huge week for the economy, as it's jam-packed with data that will tell us whether the economy is taking off or not. The highlight of the week will come Thursday, when the June, Non-Farm Payrolls report will come out. But we should learn something interesting today, when auto companies like Ford and GM report total vehicle sales for June. In May, auto sales surged to their highest level since the crisis, with sales coming in at 16.7 million annualized unit rate. FRED But the big May surge may have just been the result of pent up demand after the cold winter, and not actually reflective of economic strength. So sales are expected to slip a bit from 16.7 million (annualized) to 16.4 million.  If the slip to June is minimal, then that says the economy is still solid. If car sales fall much lower, then watch out. Stay tuned. We'll be covering all the numbers live today. FREE AppDownload
