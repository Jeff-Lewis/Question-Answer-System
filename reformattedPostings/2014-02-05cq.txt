Flickr/Renzo Apostoli Good morning! Earlier today markets were flat. Now we're starting to see some slippage. Asian markets were fine. But US futures are down a little bit, and European stocks are mixed. Germany is down, while France and Italy are higher. It's going to be a good day for economic data, as we have the ADP jobs report (at 8:15) as well as non-manufacturing PMI and ISM reports. There are also plenty of earnings coming out today, including from Disney, Coca-Cola, and Twitter. FREE AppDownload
