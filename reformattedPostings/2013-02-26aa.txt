tHis1tRik4U / FlickrMarkets are mostly up in Asia follow a rally in the US that was fueled by positive economic data.  But Japan is the notable loser. Japan's Nikkei is down 0.8 percent. Korea's Kospi is up 0.2 percent. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX is up 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 0.4 percent. China's Shanghai Composite is up 0.3 percent. Japan's sell-off is likely attributable to modest gains in the yen against other international currencies.  This makes the country's exports more expensive and it's the exact opposite of what its leaders want.
