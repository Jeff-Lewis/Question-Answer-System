Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesFor those perpetually on the lookout for any tiny hint of inflation in this lowflation world, here's a nugget: UK inflation rose to 1.8% to 1.6%, although there may have been some one-time factors at play. From the ONS: The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew by 1.8% in the year to April 2014, up from 1.6% in March. Increases in transport costs, notably air fares, sea fares and motor fuels, provided the largest contribution to the rise in the rate.
