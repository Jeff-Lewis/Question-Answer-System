The median rent for an apartment is more than $1,463 per month, which is higher than every other major city in the country.  Chris Rutherford at The Bold Italic talked to the folks at Zillow.com to gather data for San Francisco rent over the last three years. Then he created an awesome visual showing how the rent in each neighborhood has changed and how it will continue to change.
