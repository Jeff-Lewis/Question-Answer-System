REUTERS/ Toby MelvilleIf it's summer, it's gin and tonic time. So last month's International Wine and Spirit Competition did us all a favor by ranking out the best bottles of liquid juniper in the world. Two bottles achieved a "Gold Outstanding" ranking, setting the industry standard for excellence. Three other distilleries took home a "Gold." While prices may vary depending on location, these gins — ranging from $12 to $70 — won't hurt your checkbook. Here are the winners (and the judges' colorful descriptions): Gold Outstanding: Adnams Copper House Distilled Gin "A creamy, sweetly-spiced satisfying gin that is inviting and engaging. It’s ample, bold and complex with well-balanced notes of cardamom, nutmeg and bark. A beautifully crafted example." Price: $40 No. 3 London Dry Gin "Ripe and youthful, this is a juicy expression of juniper with florality. The gin develops beautifully from the nose as it transitions to a complex palate and a long finish." Price: $45 Gold: Beefeater Burrough’s Reserve "An aromatic, balanced and complex gin is complemented by judicious notes of oak, bringing sweet vanilla overtones. Extremely well-integrated with lovely attractive aromatics parading on the finish." Price: $70 (according to Beefeater) Gibson’s London Dry Gin "Extremely well-balanced, complex and impressively full at this strength. Juicy citrus, luscious texture and a ripe style combine in a gin that punches above its weight." Price: $12 Professor Cornelius Ampleforth Bathtub Gin "Delicate aromas of juniper and spice, with a touch of glycerine sweetness, lead the way to a classy palate, with an impressively gentle delivery for its strength, and a lingering finish that only emphasis the underlying quality of the base spirit."
