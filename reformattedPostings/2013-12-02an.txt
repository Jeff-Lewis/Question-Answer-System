YouTube/PulseVideoStarThe German Federal Motor Transport Authority, Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) has concluded an investigation into three recent Tesla Model S fires and found "no manufacturer-related defects," Tesla said today. In a press release, Tesla said it provided the KBA with relevant data on the accidents, and received a letter saying "no further measures under the German Product Safety Act [Produktsicherheitsgesetz (ProdSG)] are deemed necessary." In November, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the three fires. Tesla said it has "requested" the process, but NHTSA Administrator told a House panel that was untrue, according to The Detroit News. That investigation is ongoing, but at least the Germans have been placated. FREE AppDownload
