Waverly AdvisorsChanging climate conditions, higher demand in Asia, and inefficient agricultural practices are likely to cause demand-supply imbalances for agricultural commodities. For China which has extremely inefficient farming practices this means it could take a hit as a net importer of grains. In a presentation titled Macro Perspective: Hunger &amp; Pride, Waverly Advisors gives an overview of Chinese grain demand and points out that in the long-run Beijing needs to increase crop yields per-acre ratio to build food security. Thanks to Waverly Advisors for giving us permission to run this presentation.
