BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR GlobalThis week, there was a massive push into global equity funds — to the tune of $21.4 billion, according to the latest data from EPFR Global. $6.0 billion of the inflows went into long-only funds — the biggest week for the asset class in 9 months. "Fed goes AWOL...investors go All-In. Big, frothy inflows to stocks," writes BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett writes in a note to clients. "Since June, $83 billion into equity funds versus $80 billion out of bond funds (Chart 2); investors beginning to worry about a repeat of Q4 1999, when the Fed left the liquidity gates wide open because of 'Y2K' fears with tech bubble outcome." U.S. equity funds expanded assets under management by $11.5 billion, but $8.6 billion of those inflows were into exchange-traded funds like SPY, QQQ, and MDY. European equity funds saw their biggest weekly inflow ever, taking in $5.0 billion.
