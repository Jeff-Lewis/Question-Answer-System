The tech city has experienced the highest wage growth of any city in the U.S. over the past 12 months, with paychecks growing at a rate of 3.7%. While Silicon Valley is an important contributor to San Francisco's economy, tourism is its primary moneymaker. In fact, Pier 39 near the Fisherman’s Wharf is one of the most popular tourism spots to visit in the nation. Other cities with the most wage growth include Baltimore, with its world-class hospital systems, and Seattle, a city also known for its tourist attractions.
