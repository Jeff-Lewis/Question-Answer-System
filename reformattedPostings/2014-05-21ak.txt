Business Insider / Matthew LynleyZendesk may have helped tech investors get back to workZendesk (ZEN), the Software-as-a-Service platform operator, has seen its shares gain more than 50% since their debut on Thursday of last week.  And while a sharp rally after a public debut is not uncommon, Zendesk's IPO comes amid a terrible market for cloud and internet stocks.  Cloud and internet stocks that became momentum darlings for investors, such as FireEye (FEYE) and Workday (WDAY), lost as much as 60% peak-to-trough from February to May. Even technology stalwarts like Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) saw their shares drop considerably from late-winter through the spring.  And Box Inc., which offers cloud storage services, has reportedly delayed its own much-anticipated IPO.  But after the sharp dives that have been seen in these tech issues, Zendesk may be providing investors with a glimmer of hope. Zendesk's IPO benefitted from what was seen as unaggressive pricing. The $9 share offering price  compared to a $12.08 valuation that had been implied in stock options granted to employees on March 12, according to the company's S-1.  Zendesk  has also steadied the IPO waters after slides following the notable debut of 'Candy Crush' maker King Digital (KING), which has fallen since pricing its IPO at $22.50 per share. King shares are currently trading just north of $16.  And while Zendesk has endured losses in each of its years since inception, investors may also see Zendesk as a potential takeover candidate for a larger tech company looking to bolster its cloud presence, like Microsoft (MSFT) or Oracle (ORCL).  Editor's Note: A previous version of this story misstated the change in shares of GrubHub (GRUB) since that company's IPO. Shares of GrubHub have gained 20% since their April debut, not declined as was previously stated.  FREE AppDownload
