Now that security software pioneer John McAfee is out of the grasps of the Belize government, he's come out and said that he was the ultimate spymaster.  McAfee has lied to the public in the past, and he went on TV to say he loves hoaxes, so you have to take EVERYTHING he says with a grain of salt. He says that after Belize police raided his house in April, he sought revenge. So he says bought 75 laptops, loaded them with keystroke monitoring software, and gave them as presents to government employees, police officers, and other powerful people in Belize. McAfee says he then hired 23 women and six men to be his "operatives." He says he trained them how to do things like access and load software onto someone's computer, and how to hack into someone's phone. He says some of those women were also "pillow talk" masters who used their seductive charm to get information out of employees at Belize's two national phone companies. Throughout his process, McAfee says he uncovered an "uncountable" number of sexual affairs, discovered that the Prime Minster personally ordered the murder of alled Belizean gang leader Arthur Young, and found a link between Belize and the Hezbollah terrorist organization.
