AP ImagesMarc AndreessenNetscape founder and Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen has joined the chorus of people warning that startups are taking on too much risk and burning too much cash. The so-called startup burn rate conversation was sparked by Benchmark's Bill Gurley, who recently told The Wall Street Journal that "Silicon Valley as a whole ... is taking on an excessive amount of risk right now." He believes startups are burning a dangerous amount of cash — an amount that resembles 1999 just before the dotcom bubble burst. Here was Andreessen's own warning on Twitter: "When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on. Many high burn rate companies will VAPORIZE."  Over the past few years, it's been relatively easy for startups to raise money from venture capitalists. In some cases, they're raising hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their companies afloat. But behind the scenes, they're plowing through that money either on marketing, overhead, or some other expense, which results in high burn rates. These bloated companies are using their millions to hide serious flaws in their business models. Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson agreed with Gurley, stating: "We have multiple portfolio companies burning multiple millions of dollars a month. Thankfully its not our entire portfolio. But it is more than I’d like and more than I’m personally comfortable with." Wilson's firm has invested in companies such as MongoDB, Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga and Tumblr. Gurley's has invested in Snapchat, Uber, OpenTable and Yelp. Now Andreessen, who's an investor in Pinterest, Foursquare and Fab, also says the tech world should be worried. High burn rates are dangerous for a few reasons. Andreessen explains:  Andreessen's final message to the tech industry: "Worry." Here's the complete 18-Tweet tweetstorm, below.
