Even though the U.S. economy is roughly twice the size of the Chinese economy, Americans seem to believe that China is more powerful than the U.S. This is according to a recent survey from Gallup. Twelve years ago, only 10 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup believed China to be the world's leading economic power.  This compares to the 53 percent who picked China this year. Only 32 percent of Americans believing that their home country has the most powerful economy. Japan came in third, with 8 percent of the respondents. The remaining 2 percent chose the European Union, India, or Russia. GallupResults based on Gallup's annual World Affairs poll, conducted Feb. 7-10.  The idea that China is the world's most powerful economy is most popular among younger Americans. Three out of five Americans below the age of 50 believed China to be the most powerful economy. In contrast, only one in five American aged 65 or older believed the same. More Republicans and Independents view China as a more powerful economy than do Democrats.  Here's a breakdown. Gallup So what's the cause of these distorted views of reality?  Gallup explains: That may be due partly to the health of the U.S. economy at the time of the survey, with the 2000 poll conducted during robust economic times and later updates asked during a struggling economy. The shift may also reflect an acknowledgment of China's explosive economic growth in recent years, even though the United States still ranks as the No. 1 economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). However, China is poised to overtake the U.S. as the largest economy in the next several years. Perhaps as the economy improves, this misperception will turn. FREE AppDownload
