Bloomberg TelevisionJP Morgan's Tom Lee has earned a reputation for being a perma-bull for his consistently bullish calls on the stock market. And that bullishness has generally worked out for him.  Last year, he basically nailed the trajectory of the S&amp;P 500. However, we were taken aback by a note Lee put out on February 22.  It was titled "Stepping Aside Short-Term; Fade Strength and Look for Better Entry Point Around 1400-1450; Big Picture Constructive." The title speaks for itself.  And anyone who listened would've missed out on a rally that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its all-time high. In a note released this morning, Lee revisits that call. "Equities have since risen further, ending positive for February and up 2% so far in March," he writes.  "What have we overlooked?" He offers five points, which we paraphrase: Having said that, Lee is reiterating his short-term cautiousness. "Are we still expecting a pause?," he asks. "Yes." But just in case stocks continue to rise: "What could go wrong with our view? It is possible that equities are entering a new phase in this bull market—lower volatility and steadier gains. Thus, the greatest risk to our view is to the upside— that rather than a pullback, the market simply is undergoing a rolling consolidation (laggard sectors fall to the wayside). Our big picture view remains constructive." FREE AppDownload
