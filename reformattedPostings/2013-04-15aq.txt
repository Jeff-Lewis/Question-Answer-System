APPresident Barack Obama vowed on Monday that the U.S. will "get to the bottom" of today's explosions at the Boston Marathon, promising those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice." "We will find out who did this, and we will hold them accountable," Obama said in the White House briefing room shortly after 6 p.m. Monday evening. Obama said that the U.S. still did not know who was behind the bombings or any motivation. According to Bloomberg, a White House official said that "any event with multiple explosive devices — as this appears to be — is clearly an act of terror." Obama took a more cautious approach in his address. "We still do not know who did this or why, and people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts," Obama said.  "The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight," he added. Earlier today, the White House released a photo of Obama being briefed by FBI Director Robert Mueller. According to a White House pool report, Obama has also been briefed on the situation by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.  Obama has been in contact with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Here's video of Obama's address: FREE AppDownload
