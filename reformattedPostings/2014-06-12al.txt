 REUTERS/Stephen Lam Shares of Tesla have turned negative after CEO Elon Musk made the company's patents available for fair use.  Musk announced his decision in a blog post, which outlined why the company no longer feels compelled to protect its patents. Musk said that the company's real competition is, "not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world's factories every day."
