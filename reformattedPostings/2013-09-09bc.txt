On Saturday evening I was looking for an interesting Midtown Manhattan restaurant to get dinner.  I decided to try an Italian place on 56th Street called Il Tinello. It's a really charming spot.  The service was impeccable and the food and wine was fantastic.   It turns out that billionaire investor Carl Icahn is a regular customer there, too.  He even has his own special dish on the menu called "Pasta Alla Icahn."  It's farfalle with tomatoes, onions and pancetta and it costs $23.50. I didn't try Icahn's favorite.  I also didn't see a "Penne Alla Ackman" on the menu. Check it out:  Julia La Roche for Business Insider FREE AppDownload
