Those hoping for the US economy to accelerate in the second half - and many economists made that call early in the year - will be disappointed. While employment metrics seem to show steady improvements, putting the Fed on the "taper path", the economy is facing some increasing headwinds. Here are four indicators signaling a tough road ahead. 1. The rate of improvement in the housing sector is slowing. Weak new home sales number was the first indication that not all is well with US housing (discussed here), but now home price increases (HPI) have leveled off. This trend may actually take MBS off the table for the Fed's taper, leaving the central bank to focus on cutting back only the treasury purchases. SoberLook 2. Personal income growth remains weak. 3. Growth in consumer spending (which represents over 70% of the GDP) has slowed as well. SoberLook 4. As discussed earlier (see post), consumer confidence has peaked in the second quarter and has been declining steadily since. What's particularly troubling is that according to Gallup polling right before this weekend, economic confidence index suddenly dove to the lowest level since the sequester went into effect in March. The uncertainty related to the Syrian crisis and potential US military involvement is one potential explanation. FREE AppDownload
