MorningstarPIMCO had redemptions totaling $2.49 billion in February, according to Morningstar — by far the most among the big fund families funds measured.  That's actually down from January's figure of $5.657 billion in outflows. Over the past 12 months, PIMCO has seen more than $50 billion in outflows, Morningstar says. PIMCO's market share dropped 16 points month-over-month to 4.61%, though it remains the fourth-largest open-end fund in the U.S. Franklin Templeton is next with 3.91% of total market share.  Lately, PIMCO has attracted press for all the wrong reasons.

That in turn led Gross to tell a Reuters reporter that El-Erian was trying to "undermine" him. While these tabloid headlines have little to do with the firm's investment style, investors and clients can't help but wonder if all this is a big distraction for PIMCO's analysts and managers.
