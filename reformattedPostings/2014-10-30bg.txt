REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer ECB president Mario Draghi. Two weeks ago, the New York Times revealed a stunning leak from the European Central Bank (ECB). The paper posted a story about negotiations pertaining to Cyprus' financial crisis from late 2012 to early 2013, a nugget that was pulled from the ECB minutes. "The New York Times has reviewed governing council minutes dating from May 2012 to January 2013 — just two months before the controversial Cyprus bailout," the article stated.  The Cyprus story was great on its own, but perhaps more significant is the fact that the Times was able to get its hands on the ECB minutes. Unlike the Fed, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan, the ECB will not release a record of its meeting discussions for 30 years.  And since the ECB was established fewer than 30 years ago, in 1998, none of the meeting minutes have been released to the public yet. This was the first time in history that any such documents had been obtained by financial media.  Which leads us to the next question: Where are the rest of the minutes and what was discussed in them? The eurozone was not quiet for the 9-month period that The Times says it has records of, so there could potentially be dozens more stories to come out of the minutes — except there haven't been. On Wednesday, Twitter's Nelder Mead noted the lack of articles on the subject. Using the ECB's own crisis timeline, it is clear that the documents from this timeframe could cover several other imporant areas, including: It's quite possible that the NYT is working on more pieces. Or maybe the ECB minutes just aren't that juicy. But since the majority of us have never seen any, we can't really say for sure.  FREE AppDownload
