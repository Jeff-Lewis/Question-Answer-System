(This post has been edited by Business Insider) Admittedly, Black Friday is not my favorite day of the year; neither is Cyber Monday for that matter. But I do recognize that a deal is a deal. And we all like a good deal, do we not? So anyway, without further delay, here is a round up of a number of brands and stores holding sales (and a few others that are not doing sales that I included because I like them). The list is subject to change (and hopefully growth), so please keep checking in. Any questions or additions you’d like to make, sound off in the comments. Check it out below, or download here.
