Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt, in his first public speech since taking office in early January, also said the two government-controlled firms would ease standards that govern when banks must buy back faulty loans from the two mortgage finance giants, which could also help loosen the credit taps. "FHFA will not use its authority as conservator to reduce current loan limits," Watt told the Brookings Institution. "This decision is motivated by concerns about how such a reduction could adversely impact the health of the current housing finance market." In easing standards for so-called mortgage put-backs - when banks are required to repurchase faulty mortgage they sold to the two companies - Watt took aim at a risk lenders cite for the still-tight credit that has hindered the housing recovery. Tight lending standards have made it especially hard for first-time buyers and those with weaker credit to get mortgages. Watt said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy about 60 percent of new home loans and package them into securities they issue with a guarantee, would relax the mortgage payment history requirements lenders need to meet. FHFA has sued 18 financial institutions, alleging they saddled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with bad mortgages. Those lawsuits have resulted in settlements of about $16 billion so far. "Repurchase risk remains a top concern for the mortgage industry," Watt said. "Ultimately, this undermines the goal of improving access to mortgage credit for creditworthy borrowers."
