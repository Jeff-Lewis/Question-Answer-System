Governors from California, Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Guam have already visited the country on trade missions in 2013, and more than a dozen states currently have offices in China to promote trade and investment. California Gov. Jerry Brown recently reopened the state’s trade office in Shanghai, which was closed in 2003 because of budget cuts, according to Bloomberg . In 2012, the United States exported $108.6 billion worth of goods to China, making it the third-largest US export market, according to a recent report by the US-China Business Council . (USCBC is the publisher of the China Business Review.) China ranked as one of the top three export markets for 34 states, and 30 states exported more than $1 billion worth of goods to China.  And since 2009—when US exports to China dipped slightly because of the global economic slowdown—12 states have doubled their exports to China. The top 10 states exported $59.9 billion worth of goods to China in 2012, accounting for more than half of all US exports to China. Here is a summary of the states that exported the most goods to China in 2012.
