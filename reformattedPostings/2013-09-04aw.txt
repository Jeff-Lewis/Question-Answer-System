StatigramFor the finer things in life, everyone needs a sensei — a guide to teach them how to be their best selves. The art of dressing, especially for men, is no exception. Work clothes, play clothes, and everything in between  — it takes inspiration to make everything look put-together and effortless. Sure you have your style icons — your Clooneys, your Dwayne Wades (if that's how you roll) — but that will only get you so far on the day to day. For advice on demand, it's wise to follow some seriously well dressed men on Instagram. Consider them your Sartorialist side kick. To pick out some of the lesser known creatives, Business Insider consulted some of our favorite fashion bloggers, like The Fine Young Gentleman, and fashion entrepreneurs Hugh and Crye. You'll see some well known names on this list too — like GQ magazine and Bergdorf Goodman. Remember: Whether or not you want to spend an arm and a leg on your clothes, ideas can come from anywhere, so check these early and often. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice.
