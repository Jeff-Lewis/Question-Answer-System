Using homeownership-by-age data from the Census Bureau, we compared households by years of birth to examine how homeownership changes over consumers' lifetimes. John Burns Real Estate Consulting Our consulting team has been pointing out a real dearth of entry-level buyers over the last several years, which is counterintuitive when you consider that this has been the most affordable time in generations to buy a home. What we learned is that a huge percentage of households bought a home earlier than usual, and that same group has gone through more foreclosures than any generation before them. What does this mean? It is more difficult than usual to sell entry-level homes today, but the pent-up demand for entry-level housing is huge.
