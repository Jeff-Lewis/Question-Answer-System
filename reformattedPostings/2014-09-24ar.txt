tharineepu on InstagramKFC Japan emphasizes Colonel Sanders much more than its U.S. counterpart.KFC is wildly popular in Japan. The fast food chain has more than 1,200 locations there, making it the fried chicken chain's third-largest market behind the U.S. and China.  As sales decline in the U.S., KFC is focusing on Asian markets to bring in big profits.  Here are a few reasons KFC Japan is completely different from the U.S. version. Americans are crazy about all-white-meat chicken. In Japan, the patties, strips, and nuggets feature light and dark meat, as seen in this ad.  <U+660E><U+65E5>25<U+65E5>(<U+6728>)<U+3088><U+308A><U+3001><U+300C><U+3086><U+305A><U+8F9B><U+30C1><U+30AD><U+30F3><U+300D><U+3092><U+671F><U+9593><U+9650><U+5B9A><U+3067><U+8CA9><U+58F2><U+3044><U+305F><U+3057><U+307E><U+3059><U+3002><U+9AD8><U+77E5><U+770C><U+7523><U+306E><U+3086><U+305A><U+76AE><U+306E><U+3055><U+308F><U+3084><U+304B><U+306A><U+9999><U+308A><U+304C><U+30C1><U+30AD><U+30F3><U+306E><U+30B8><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30FC><U+306A><U+65E8><U+5473><U+3092><U+3072><U+304D><U+305F><U+3066><U+308B><U+3001><U+79CB><U+306B><U+3074><U+3063><U+305F><U+308A><U+306E><U+4E00><U+54C1><U+3067><U+3059><U+3002> pic.twitter.com/PjIFOs1YZ4   KFC caters to local tastes by offering rice products, such as bowls and a shrimp patty.

"The bill was over $43 — and that was without any drinks."  Colonel Saunders is much more prominently featured in KFC Japan's culture. The Twitter page frequently shows a mascot interacting with customers in the restaurant.    <U+30AB><U+30FC><U+30CD><U+30EB><U+3055><U+3093><U+304C><U+304A><U+51FA><U+8FCE><U+3048>!#KFC<U+30A2><U+30F3><U+30D0><U+30B5><U+30C0><U+30FC> pic.twitter.com/Ue62n4pL6z Christmas isn't a national holiday in Japan, and only 1% of citizens identify as Christians. But thanks to a successful marketing campaign in 1974, people flock to KFC on Christmas Day, according to Smithsonian Magazine.  "Many order their boxes of 'finger lickin' holiday cheer months in advance to avoid the lines — some as long as two hours," Smithsonian writes.  YouTube Most Japanese customers automatically order fries as a side to their fried chicken. Mashed potatoes take on a different form — they are packed with cheese and bacon and then deep-fried.  "The customer service here is leaps and bounds ahead of that in the U.S.", according to the Japan-based food blogger Facing The Rising Sun. KFC workers in Japan go through extensive culinary training.  <U+30AD><U+30C3><U+30BA><U+30B9><U+30AF><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+3092>5<U+6708>25<U+65E5>(<U+65E5>)<U+3001><U+8AAD><U+58F2><U+6771><U+4EAC><U+672C><U+793E><U+30D3><U+30EB><U+5E97><U+306B><U+3066><U+958B><U+50AC><U+3057><U+307E><U+3057><U+305F>!<U+4ECA><U+56DE><U+3082><U+300C><U+30AA><U+30EA><U+30B8><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30C1><U+30AD><U+30F3><U+300D><U+3084><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30C9><U+3092><U+5B9F><U+969B><U+306B><U+8ABF><U+7406><U+3057><U+3066><U+3001><U+305D><U+308C><U+3092><U+307F><U+3093><U+306A><U+3067><U+5473><U+308F><U+3044><U+307E><U+3057><U+305F><U+266A><U+3054><U+53C2><U+52A0><U+3044><U+305F><U+3060><U+3044><U+305F><U+7686><U+3055><U+307E><U+3001><U+3069><U+3046><U+3082><U+3042><U+308A><U+304C><U+3068><U+3046><U+3054><U+3056><U+3044><U+307E><U+3057><U+305F>!\(^o^)/ pic.twitter.com/RsoJcepCXW In honor of "Colonel's Day," KFC Japan gave away some crazy chicken-themed computer accessories. Free gifts included a computer mouse shaped like a drumstick. KFC Japan Unlike the buttery biscuits in the U.S., KFC Japan's biscuits are shaped like donuts, and have a sweet flavor. While the biscuits clearly resonate with the Japanese palette, Americans on a Reddit thread called them "terrible" and "bland."    It's easy to get your KFC delivered in Japan. Couriers bring your food on company-themed motorbikes.   FREE AppDownload
