via CNBCHere's an interesting  move in the world of financial media ... CNBC Executive Producer John Melloy — a star who's been at CNBC for more than seven years — is leaving the financial network to be the CEO of Stocktwits, according a source familiar with the matter. Melloy has been in charge of CNBC's "Halftime Report" as well as the very successful show "Fast Money." Stocktwits — which was founded by Howard Lindzon — was an early player in social finance. It consists of an avid community of traders constantly tweeting ideas and news, as well as a network of highly respected finance blogs. Lindzon, we're told, will be moving from the CEO role to Chairman. When reached for comment, Melloy told BI: "I look forward to the opportunity at Stocktwits. It's already an incredible company. I'm joining it at a great time."   As for his time at CNBC, he says: "CNBC was an amazing experience. This was my decision." FREE AppDownload
