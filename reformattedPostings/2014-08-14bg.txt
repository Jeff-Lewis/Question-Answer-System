Class A shares of Berkshire, which have never been split, rose as high as $201,114, as the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value swelled to $327.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Berkshire's share price has doubled since it first crossed the $100,000 barrier on Oct. 5, 2006. The S&amp;P 500 has jumped 44 percent since that date through Wednesday. Buffett, who turns 84 on Aug. 30 and is the world's third-richest person, oversees a conglomerate with more than 80 businesses ranging from Geico car insurance to the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen ice cream, and more than $119 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Co and Coca-Cola Co. In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway posted a record $6.4 billion profit, helped by a stock swap and growing earnings in many businesses, on revenue of $49.76 billion. By some measures, Berkshire remains moderately priced, trading at about 1.4 times its book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, in the most recent quarter. Buffett has said he will consider buybacks only at or below a 1.2 times multiple. Berkshire also has lower-cost Class B shares, which Buffett launched in 1996 to thwart unit investment trusts purporting to be "clones" of Berkshire but which carried high costs. Those shares now trade at about 1/1,500th of a Class A share and carry voting rights equal to 1/10,000th of a Class A share. Buffett has since 2006 been donating Berkshire shares to several charities, but still owns about one-fifth of the company and controls about one-third of its voting power. His net worth was about $65.3 billion as of Wednesday, Forbes magazine said. (Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum) FREE AppDownload
