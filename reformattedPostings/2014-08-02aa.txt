That compares with a reading of 55 in June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. A reading above 50 in PMI surveys indicates an expansion in activity while one below the threshold points to a contraction. A spate of economic indicators released earlier this month suggested that the world's second-largest economy is experiencing a mild recovery as a flurry of government stimulus measures kick into effect.   (Reporting by China Economics Team; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore) FREE AppDownload
