Stefano Pozzebon/Business InsiderThe Eurozone's composite PMI just came in at 51.4, the lowest in 16 months. That's after some unexpectedly poor numbers for Germany. The major business survey is pointing to a significant slowdown in Europe.  Analysts had expected the PMI (purchasing managers index) figure to come in at 52.3 overall, an improvement from October's 52.1. Output in the eurozone is falling back toward the neutral 50 mark. Anything below that level signals a contraction, and recession. As the largest economy in Europe, Germany has an over-sized effect on the whole continent: when they sneeze, everyone else catches a cold. So a slowdown in PMI numbers there can drag the whole index down. Germany's also weighing on efforts to revive Europe's economy, dragging its feet on stimulus plans at both the domestic and European levels.  Here's how it looks against European growth. Markit The German figures weren't the only poor ones out this morning. France's PMI numbers were poor again, coming in at just 48.4. Just as the PMI numbers came out, the Italian government confirmed a 1.5% drop in industrial orders between August and September. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, weighed in on what the figures mean for Europe's politicians and central bankers: Policymakers will no doubt be disappointed that recent announcements and stimulus measures are showing no signs of reviving growth. The deteriorating trend in the surveys will add to pressure for the European Central Bank to do more to boost the economy without waiting to gauge the effectiveness of previously-announced initiatives.
