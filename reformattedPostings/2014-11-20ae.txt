Uber is a four-year-old mobile ride service company that could soon generate $10 billion of revenue per year, according to a source familiar with the numbers. How much revenue is Uber already generating? How many active users does it have, and how many people are driving for it in cities around the world? Business Insider obtained an internal Uber presentation that's nearly 60 pages long last week that was produced in early 2014. In it, there's city-by-city data in terms of revenue, active drivers, average fares, active users, trips per week, and more. Most of the data spans only one month, December 2013. Even though the numbers are dated, there's a lot to learn from it. For example, San Francisco generated nearly $18 million of revenue that month. (Uber's revenue is the total amount it collects from riders, most of which Uber then pays to drivers.) A year of revenue at that monthly rate would make San Francisco alone a $212 million business annually for Uber. And that's just one market. That calculation also assumes no growth, and Uber has expanded to 230 cities since then.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the document: Business Insider sifted through and organized the data into a number of charts and graphs to make it easier to scan. We also included the city-by-city breakdowns directly from the Uber presentation so you can see how the charts were derived. Here's the most in-depth look at Uber's operations yet.
