"All I'll say is that you'd think investors would've learned from the Tech bubble and housing bubble, but I guess they were just dying to touch the hot stove once again. now they're getting burned," said Rich Bernstein in a recent email to Business Insider. Other big losers: The good news for diversified investors is that the whole stock market isn't selling off. Market strategist Ed Yardeni has characterized this as an "internal correction," with investors moving from smaller momentum stocks to more stable large-cap stocks. In this environment, Deutsche Bank's David Bianco recommends over-weighting mega-cap Tech and Banks. "Investor confidence in the likelihood of the much stronger growth needed to support valuations, especially at small caps and S&amp;P 500 non mega-caps, is fading," said Bianco.
