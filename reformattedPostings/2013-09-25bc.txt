First it was Jefferies. Then Citi. Now it's Deutsche Bank's turn: Stock promptly plunges because nobody could have possible foreseen this...  Shortly, everyone else. Which is funny, because a week ago we asked: Just how, if at all, are banks hedged or providioned for an increase in volatility and/or rates from these levels, if a mere 4% blimp in equity markets caused Jefferies to nearly write-down it entire bond-trading revenue for the quarter? We now know: not at all. We also said: "And now that Jefferies is in the record books, just how bad with bond trading results for the rest of the big banks be? We should know in about 4 weeks." Answer: very bad.   FREE AppDownload
