Are you consumed with reading about how much money you need to save today in order to retire luxuriously? Do you religiously track what you spend on Mint.com? Are you bored with the way Personal Finance is covered on the web? We're looking for a writer for Business Insider's lively Personal Finance section. The ideal candidate has at least 2 years of professional web experience preferably at a national website, and is an exceptional writer who is a pro at coming up with story ideas and framing them for a general business audience. This person would also be packaging content from syndication partners and outside contributors. We're looking for someone who not only understands the world of personal finance but also has the smarts to be creative and innovative with it. We want someone to cover an often dry and jargon-filled subject in a surprising, personal and accessible way — someone who has ideas for exciting ways to share information, whether it's through infographics, photo slide shows, or video interviews. Other necessities: this person should be a team player with a great attitude and a strong work ethic. Familiarity using Content Management Systems is a plus, as is experience with basic Photoshop. If interested, please send a resume and 3 writing clips to jliebman@businessinsider.com. In your brief email, make the case for why you're the one for the job. FREE AppDownload
