">BloombergTalking Biz News has a list of journalists that have been laid off by Bloomberg News, and contrary to reports, the list doesn't just include reporters in sections like sports and lifestyle. This weekend the New York Post reported that the company would lay off 50-100 reporters on Monday.

Babcock was an editor on the projects &amp; investigations team at Bloomberg News. Not a soft news person among them. For a longer list at Talking Biz News, head here&gt; FREE AppDownload
