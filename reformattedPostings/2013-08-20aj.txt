Dell — which has received its share of press lately thanks to Carl Icahn's ploy to derail a takeover — was the largest addition for the group of 50 funds. That's largely thanks to Icahn's massive purchase of the stock. Apple also saw large inflows last quarter, at $1.4 billion, after three straight quarters of outflows. On the other hand, Google, the most widely held stock (64% of funds), saw $1.4 billion worth of its shares sold by the 50 mightiest funds. We ranked the stocks by their aggregate value held by the top 50 hedge funds. We also include the number of funds holding the stock. And we start with #50. FREE AppDownload
