The FDNY put out the truck fire on the Queensboro Bridge at 12:30 p.m., but the bridge remains mostly closed to traffic, and that's causing a nightmare for anyone trying to get around or off Manhattan. The bridge has one Manhattan-bound lane open, but nobody can use it to get off the island. As you can see from Google Maps' real time traffic data, that's causing a real mess. Alternative crossings, like the Robert F. Kennedy and Williamsburg Bridges, are snarled too as they pick up diverted traffic. Google mapsReal-time traffic in Manhattan as of 5 PM, August 16 And routes going across, up, and down town are also snarled as drivers who would normally cross the Queensboro seek to access other crossings. If you're trying to get to the Hamptons, we suggest the Manhattan Bridge or the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, if you can reach them. Staying put on Manhattan is also an option. FREE AppDownload
