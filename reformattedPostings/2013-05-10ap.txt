YouTubeCarl Icahn was just on CNBC talking to Scott Wapner about the Dell deal, and Wapner just asked him about Jim Chanos' concerns about the company — the famous short-seller has made it clear that he's bearish on anything that has to do with the PC business. In fact, he presented his short thesis on hardware company Seagate this week at the Sohn Investment Conference. So it's no surprise that Chanos is short Dell. Wapner played a clip of Chanos on CNBC saying that he has no idea why companies like Silver Lake are even interested in Dell and gave Icahn the chance to respond. "I've been on the other side of him [Chanos] many times and I've made fortunes being against him," said Icahn. "I don't mean this in a derrogatory way, but I don't see Chanos on the Forbes 400 list," he said. Icahn ranks #21 on that list. Icahn went on to say that Dell was more than just a PC company, and that it's made important acqusitions in the software space that will make it a leader in cloud technology. Fair enough, but then again, we know that Chanos loves to short companies that have made a lot of acqusitions. Time will tell who's right. Watch the video below from CNBC:  FREE AppDownload
