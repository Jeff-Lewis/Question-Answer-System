Two bags  stash were found  in a compartment in the bathroom on a  Jet Airways Boeing 737 that had traveled from Mumbai to the Thai capital Bangkok before returning to Kolkata. Airport director BP Sharma told NBC News that the 53 pounds of gold appeared to have originated in the United Arab Emirates. India is the world's largest consumer of gold and smuggling has become rampant. In October four men were arrested for stashing 70 lbs of gold biscuits in the lavatory of an Air India flight.
