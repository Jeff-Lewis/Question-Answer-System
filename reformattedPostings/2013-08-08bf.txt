Flickr/southbeachcarsFifty years after its founding, Mary Kay Inc. — the company famous for rewarding its top salespeople with pink Cadillacs — has made its founder a billionaire. Richard Rogers was 20 years old when his mother, the eponymous Mary Kay Ash, founded what is now the third-largest direct seller of cosmetics and skincare products, according to Bloomberg. The company nets annual wholesale revenue of $3 billion and has 3 million salespeople across the globe. Rogers owns half of the company, valued at $2.6 billion.  And the multi-level marketing industry has received a strange amount of attention recently, fueled by the feud between billionaire investors Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn over the stock of Herbalife, another such company. From Bloomberg: About 350,000 Mary Kay businesses were started globally in the past year, including 90,000 in the first quarter of 2013, according to a company press release. About half of Mary Kay’s U.S. sales agents are 35-years-old or younger. March was the company’s highest-grossing month on record. Who knows if Herbalife will have Mary Kay's shelf life. Bill Ackman, who is short the stock and has already reportedly lost $300 million, surely hopes not. FREE AppDownload
