REUTERS/Sean YongChinese financial markets experienced turbulence in 2013, aggravated by two severe surges in short-term interest rates. It was also a year when economists furiously downgraded their growth forecasts in the first half of the year, prompting premier Li Keqiang to step in and put a floor on growth.  But there are four key things that will dominate the Chinese economy and markets in 2014, according to Bank of America's Ting Lu.  Ting expects economic growth to be more stable in 2014.
