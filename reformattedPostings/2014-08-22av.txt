A ton of money just piled into U.S. stocks. After 16 straight weekly outflows, U.S. equity mutual funds saw inflows of $5.2 billion, according to Morgan Stanley.  Year-to-date, however, U.S. equity mutual funds have seen net outflows of $22 billion.  The recent inflow to U.S. stocks comes as the S&amp;P 500 made a new all-time high this week, finishing Thursday's trading session at 1,992.37.  Money is also coming back into high-yield bonds, with the week ended August 20 marking the highest weekly inflows this year, according to Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan and Christine Idzelis.  Investors poured $2.2 billion into high-yield bond funds during the week, though this followed a four-week period that saw $12.6 billion was yanked from high yield bonds.
