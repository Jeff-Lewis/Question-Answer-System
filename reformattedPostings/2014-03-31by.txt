In his 3/29 Barron’s column, Randy Forsyth reviews the contrary views on this subject held by Robert Buckland, Citigroup's head of global equity strategy. Randy summarizes Buckland’s main point as follows: “Of course, companies must invest to generate future returns, but overinvestment drags down profitability, growth, and employment.” I’ve been arguing that margins are likely to remain high because I expect companies to continue to be cautious about expanding their capacity and payrolls. However, I am becoming concerned that deflationary forces (more competition and more technology) could depress margins from the top down. Needless to say, the record high in the profit margin is bound to continue to inflame the income inequality crowd. During Q4-2013, wages and salaries in compensation accounted for just 48.9% of national income, the lowest share on record. Total compensation (including supplements) fell to 60.7% of national income, the lowest since Q4-1951. Of course, the data are pre-tax and before social benefits, which significantly reduce income inequality. Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Boston Views. (1) Cold, but calm, in Boston.
