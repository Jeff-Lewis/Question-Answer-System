Mercedes-BenzThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe hits U.S. roads this fall.Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the 2015 S-Class Coupe, and it's very exciting. On top of great looks inside and out, the two-door version of the German automaker's flagship sedan is chock full of technologies that promise to make it both luxurious and a beast on the road. Mercedes offers the choice to get headlights packed with 47 Swarovski crystals, but the more impressive technology can't be spotted until the coupe heads into a turn. This is the world premiere of the "active curve tilting function," which makes the car lean into turns, like a motorcyclist or skier. That improves performance and keeps passengers seated more securely on hard curves — making sporty driving even more pleasurable. The S-Class Coupe, which seats four, will make its debut at the Geneva Motor Show. Expect Mercedes to announce pricing closer to its market launch this fall.
