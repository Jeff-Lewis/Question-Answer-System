To find a streak longer than 15 days, you have to go back to February 1969, when there were 20 consecutive days with no closes greater than 0.5%.  In February 1969, Richard Nixon was president. Krinsky notes that four of the five longest streaks without a 0.5% move since 1980 were broken with up days, while the 1969 streak was broken by a 1.13% down day, followed by five more down days. This is the second major streak the S&amp;P 500 has had this year, as earlier this year the benchmark index went 62 days without a move larger than 1% before falling 1.1% on July 17 after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine.  Last week, Richard Nixon was in the news after a bizarre slip up in loan documents forced Nu Skin to confirm that the deceased former president is not a banker at JPMorgan.  On Tuesday, Nixon may again be in the financial news, except this time, for something less strange.  FREE AppDownload
