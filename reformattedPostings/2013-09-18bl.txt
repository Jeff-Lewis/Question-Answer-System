REUTERS/Christian CharisiusEconomists expect the Federal Reserve to announce that it is be tapering, or gradually reducing, it's monthly purchases of $85 billion worth Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds. In other words, it will continue to buy these bonds, but at a slower pace. However, some people trading the markets are confusing "tapering" with "tightening," the latter being the Fed's effort to actively raise interest rates. As such, Fed-watchers across Wall Street expect the Fed to reiterate very clearly that tapering is not tightening. From some economists' research notes: Should tapering accidentally cause rates to surge, the Fed's got heavy-caliber ammo for that. "True, Fed officials have used QE in the past to signal the Fed’s willingness to keep policy accommodative for a considerable period," said Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart. "But that was then. Now they can signal the intent to keep policy accommodative—the forward guidance so much in vogue among central bankers—by adjusting their threshold on unemployment or introducing a lower bound on inflation. With this heavy-caliber ammunition in reserve in the event yields back up uncomfortably later in the year, they can put QE on the road to retirement. For the incumbents at the Fed, starting now puts a body in motion that will stay in motion for the next leader." Currently, the Fed's "forward guidance" consists of an unemployment rate threshold of 6.5% and an inflation rate threshold of 2.5% to help guide monetary policy. In other words, as long as unemployment stays high and prices remain low, the Fed will continue to do what it can to keep rates low. FREE AppDownload
