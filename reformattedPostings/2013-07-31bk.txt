Nobel prize winning economist Milton Friedman would've turned 101-years-old today. And there are plenty of people who would've loved to have him around today to witness how the Federal Reserve is running monetary policy. Friedman, who is famous for his ideas on monetarism, was against the idea of a Federal Reserve.  However, he did support the expansion of money supply.

But Friedman's eloquent response has gone down as one of the finest defenses of capitalism of all time. "But it seems to reward not virtue as much as it does the ability to manipulate the system," said Donahue. "And what does reward virtue?" asked Friedman rhetorically.
