The Bib Gourmand restaurant winners are widely considered the best and most affordable restaurants in NYC. To qualify, establishments must not only cook delicious fare, but also serve two courses and a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or less (tax and gratuity not included). This year's New York City list has 126 restaurants with new eateries like Andrew Carmellini’s new Bar Primi making the cut. “While the famous Michelin stars remain the most celebrated international distinction in the Michelin Guide, the Bib Gourmand is a highly desired honor among restaurateurs and one that is recognized by the many people who covet quality food at a reasonable price,” the company explained in a press release.
