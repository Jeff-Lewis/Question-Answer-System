Nearly three quarters of the penta-millionaires are very satisfied with their marriage or "committed relationship" – far more than the 45 percent reported for the merely affluent. Millionaires are also significantly more likely to report higher levels of satisfaction regarding their relationships with their children (59 percent vs. 52 percent).
