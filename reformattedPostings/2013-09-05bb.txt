Twitter.com/aswatchdamodaranAswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor who predicted the top in Apple, and the bottom for Facebook, has just unveiled his fair price for Tesla.  The stock has been on a tear, surging over 400% since the beginning of the year to $170.62, its closing price on Wednesday. But in a new blog post, the valuation guru thinks Tesla is worth just $67.12 today. Using "standard metrics the company seems overvalued," he wrote. Of course he does point out that with companies as young as Tesla, we should  derive value not from earnings and revenue today, but expectations for these in the future. Here are Damodaran's assumptions for his current valuation: Aswath Damodara/Musings On Markets So what's Damodaran's "bottom-line"? For a young company to mature it has to 1) grow revenues, 2) start posting profits, 3) generate enough money for reinvestment. "I am assuming all of these at Tesla but my estimated value per share of $67.12 is well below the market price of $168.76." He reiterates his assumptions are very optimistic. Earlier today he tweeted, "Assuming Tesla grows to have Audi-like revenues ($67 b) &amp; Porsche-like margins (12.5%), I can't get past $70/sh." You can see Damodaran's valuation spreadsheet here.
