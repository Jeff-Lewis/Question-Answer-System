Luckily, Kevin Roose has written a great explainer of the debt ceiling at NYMag and he includes this paragraph: The central nervous system of the banking system might freeze. Fedwire is one of the least-known, most important services on Earth. It's a clearing system, run by the Federal Reserve, that banks in America use to shuttle cash, stocks, bonds, and other assets back and forth between themselves. It processes trillions of dollars a day, and has been around for nearly 100 years. But it's not set up to allow defaulted Treasury bonds to flow through its system. According to a note from RBC Capital, excerpted by FT Alphaville, if the U.S. defaults on its bonds, Fedwire could "seize" entirely, meaning that banks and other financial institutions could run into real trouble very quickly.
