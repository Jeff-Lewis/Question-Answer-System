APPresident Barack Obama's disapproval rating has jumped to a new post-election high, according to Gallup's three-day rolling average survey. Obama's disapproval rating spiked two points in the past day, putting his disapproval rating at 48 percent among adults. His approval rating sits at just 47 percent, which also puts his approval-to-disapproval split underwater for just the second time since the election. The latest pitfall comes amid a little more than a month of overall decline for Obama after a post-election honeymoon. At one point in December, Obama's approval-to-disapproval split stood at a high of 58-36. But since mid-February, the gap has narrowed. According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Obama's approval-to-disapproval split in eight recent surveys is 47.8-47.1.  This chart from Real Clear Politics provides a good look at how the gap in Obama's approval-to-disapproval split has drastically narrowed since late February: Real Clear Politics (H/T Roll Call's Steven Dennis) FREE AppDownload
