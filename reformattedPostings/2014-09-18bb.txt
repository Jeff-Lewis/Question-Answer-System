The New York Times' Josh Barro and the author Nassim Taleb got into a Twitter spat on Thursday. The topic: GMOs. And like too many fights on Twitter, things took an ugly personal turn. Strong correlation between people who think vaccines are bad, think GMOs are bad, think gluten is bad. Journalists should stay away from risk statements focus on harmless stances. https://t.co/egg8XLQWU3 @hopps3 @HuntsmanAbby @jbarro Your area of expertise is Bullshit @jbarro   @nntaleb I'm not the one urging policies to starve people.    Ignorant man you didn't read the paper you just made 2 fallacies. @jbarro    @nntaleb yes, your area of expertise is probability, and you're asking me to listen to your concerns about whether GMOs are neurotoxic.    Mr Barro we are NOT arguing for "neurotoxic"/not even local harm. Only Systemic. Silly to make such mistakes publicly @JamesNamor @jbarro   The paper Taleb tweeted at Barro is called "The Precaution Principle (with Application to the Genetic Modification of Organisms)," and argues that the precaution principle should be used to "prescribe severe limits on GMOs." Taleb has a propensity for being quite combative on Twitter, on topics ranging from bonds to GMOs, and Taleb will fight with just about anybody.  Last year, Taleb said he would take a fight to Twitter if one of the following conditions were in place: "...his critics 1) use "straw man arguments" (misrepresenting my ideas to critique them), 2) transform low probability bets into deterministic predictions, 3) mistake P/L (profit/loss) for prediction." Our guess is Barro violated nos. 1 and 2. FREE AppDownload
