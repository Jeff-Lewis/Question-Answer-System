United AirlinesNo one likes big airlines.Some companies just can’t make their customers happy, and many of the companies are the kind that customers find it hardest to escape. The latest survey results from the American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), which looks at hundreds of big companies, show that telecom companies, airlines, and social media sites are most likely to frustrate people.

On the other hand, these industries often have customers locked down and don't have to worry about making them happy. FREE AppDownload
