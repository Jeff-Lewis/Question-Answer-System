Brown Harris StevensCurbed reports that "Chateau Aromois", a beautiful East Hampton home built by late value investor Christopher Browne, has sold for $21 million. It's unclear who the buyer is, but they definitely got a stunning summer home and for much less than the asking price. The five-bedroom, five and half bathroom home listed by Brown Harris Stevens was initially put on the market for $28.5 million. The price tag was recently reduced to $22.9 million. Browne, a famous value investor and the co-founder of mutual fund company Tweedy Browne, did much of the lush landscaping on the property himself, according to Curbed.
