Margin CallA quick reminder here that there are actually two economic datapoints coming out today. The first is the Jobs Report, obviously, which comes out at 8:30 AM ET. Analysts expected over 200K, and an unemployment reading of 6.4%. However, if you're forced to stick around the office all day, there is some good news, because we get data this afternoon as well. At 3 PM we get the latest on consumer credit. Per Calculated Risk, economists are looking at an increase of $15.5 billion. FREE AppDownload
