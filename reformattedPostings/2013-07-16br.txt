REUTERS/Gary Cameron The NAHB Housing market index (HMI) crushed expectations rising to 57. Economists were looking for the HMI, a read of homebuilder confidence, to fall to 51. This is the highest level since January 2006, and was the third straight monthly rise. A reading over 50 shows that more builders think sales conditions are good rather than poor. A regional breakdown showed that homebuilder confidence climbed to 40 in the Northeast, 54 in the Midwest, 50 in the South, and 51 in the West.  “Today’s report is particularly encouraging in that it shows improvement in builder confidence across every region as well as solid gains in current sales conditions, traffic of prospective buyers and sales expectations for the next six months,” NAHB Chairman Rick Judson said in a press release. “This positive momentum could be disrupted by threats on the policy side, particularly with regard to the mortgage interest deduction and federal support for the housing finance system.” All three components of the HMI increased in July. Investors track this index because it is a leading indicator for housing starts. But Paul Diggle at Capital Economics tweeted that the NAHB has a "history of over-exuberance as a predictor of starts."
