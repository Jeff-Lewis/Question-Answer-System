JP Morgan started out 2013 by naming First Solar, the Tempe, Ariz.-based solar panel maker, as a stock investors needed to categorically avoid in 2013. 2012's list had four names, but First Solar was apparently deemed so risky as to occupy that space by itself.  The reason, according to JPM analyst Chris Blansett, was that global oversupply issues, combined with subdued natural gas prices, would make First Solar's products less valuable.
