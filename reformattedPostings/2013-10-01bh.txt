Next Tuesday is the fourth annual Big Picture Conference,  a gathering of some of Wall Streeter's smartest, most candid thinkers in one room to talk shop, markets et cetera. It all goes down from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm at the McGraw Hill Auditorium in NYC on October 8th. The day-long event is hosted by Barry Ritholtz (The Big Picture) and Josh Brown (The Reformed Broker) of Ritholtz Wealth Management, and they were kind enough to offer up a contest of sorts for those of you who haven't gotten your tickets yet. Answer the following question in our comments section below, and you'll win yourself a seat the conference. Here's the question: "What is your desert island economic or market indicator - and why?" "If you only had one single stock market, bond market, or economic indicator to navigate by, what would it be - and why that one above all others?" The answers will be judged by Brown, Ritholtz and one of the speakers, economist Stephanie Pomboy. If you need any more convincing, check out the list of speakers below. The most important thing to note is that Art Cashin will be there — which means you can have a beer with Art Cashin (this is awesome). Good luck everyone! FREE AppDownload
