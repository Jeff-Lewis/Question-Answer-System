Whether it's ketchup or ice cream or more recently batteries, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is a powerhouse, managing a stable of more than 80 businesses. Its stock trades at more than $210,000 per share. And if Berkshire Hathaway is legit, then Buffett — the company's charismatic leader — is the real deal in business. At age 84, the man has a net worth of $66.8 billion.  Buffett is the second wealthiest individual in the US, behind Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates ($81.5 billion) and ahead of Oracle's Larry Ellison ($47.3 billion). Buffett is as brilliant in business and investing as he is inspiring. Here are 10 of his best quotes, collected from his many letters to Berkshire shareholders and elsewhere around the web.  "I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life."  "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."  "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." "I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will." "After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out." "You can't make a good deal with a bad person." "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently." "Too often, a vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner. The asset I most value, aside from health, is interesting, diverse, and long-standing friends." "The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging."  "I always knew I was going to be rich. I don't think I ever doubted it for a minute. " FREE AppDownload
