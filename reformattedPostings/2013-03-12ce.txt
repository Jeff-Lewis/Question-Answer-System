Casey Research / YouTubeRichard RussellFamous Dow Theorist Richard Russell has been bearish on stocks for as long as we can remember. But in his latest newsletter, he shocked us by recommending that his followers should buy stocks via the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's an excerpt via King World News: Yes, I know that this market is uncorrected during its long rise from the 2009 low, and I know that there are risks in buying an uncorrected advance that is becoming uncomfortably long in the tooth, but my suggestion is that my subscribers should take a chance (after all, Columbus took a chance) and take a position in the DIAs.  If you buy the DIAs, I suggest that you place a mental stop loss 8% below your purchase price.  Losses in investing are inevitable, but losses should always be limited.

So there you have it.  One of the stock markets biggest bears just flipped. Read more at KingWorldNews.com. FREE AppDownload
