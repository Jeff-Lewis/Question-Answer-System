For awhile now, we've (unfortunately) followed up every non-farm payroll report with the "scariest jobs chart ever." Furnished by Calculated Risk's Bill McBride, it shows how far below current employment levels remain from their pre-recession peak. Bill McBride/Calculated Risk As it happens, McBride also publishes a similar chart tracking how far industrial production has recovered. Unfortunately, like employment, we remain a decent way off from pre-recession levels.

However industrial production is still 1.7% below the pre-recession peak.  This indicator might return to the pre-recession peak in in 2014.
