Via CNBC CNBC reporter Courtney Reagan was proposed to by her hedge fund analyst boyfriend during a taping of the "Nightly Business Report." [via TVNewser] The segment was about luxury jewelry, particularly engagement rings. It was taped on November 1.  The show's host Tyler Mathisen kept on referring to middle-level jeweler Jared when Reagan's boyfriend Jared Baker walked on the set. Reagan immediately started crying as he began to propose.   "It's been a long time. Seven years... I love you so much. I have since the day I met you. I've always known you were the one. I love your smile. I love your laugh. I even love the way you dance. Will you marry me?" She said, "Yes!" And then they kissed.  Best wishes to both of them.  Baker works for Citadel as a buyside analyst.  He previously worked in Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs. Before that, he was with JPMorgan Chase and Ernst &amp; Young.  We've posted a shot of the ring and the video of the proposal below.  Via CNBC   FREE AppDownload
