Defense stocks have actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since the start of the year, a sign that investors are relatively unconcerned about the effects of the sequester budget cuts on the military-industrial complex.  Compiled by Sober Look, the chart below looks at the year-to-date performance of the S&amp;P 500 (red) against the iShares defense industry ETF (ITA, blue), which is a composite index of defense stocks. SoberLook.com See a difference? Neither does Tyler Cowen at Marginal Revolution, and the general idea is that investors by and large haven't priced in risk as a result of the implementation of sequestration into the price of defense stocks.  While ITA underperformed the S&amp;P earlier this year — during the uncertainty period — for whatever reason, they are now outpacing the S&amp;P.  This likely means one of two things: It's also conceivable that it is a little of both.  That reaction is a far cry from the doomsday rhetoric that the White House and the Pentagon have been spouting for the past few weeks, as they warn that the sequester could have long-term consequences on American military readiness.  Read the original post on Sober Look.
