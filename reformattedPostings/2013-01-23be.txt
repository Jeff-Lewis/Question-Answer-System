C-SPANThe House overwhelmingly voted in favor of a bill to suspend the debt ceiling through May 18. The bill won bipartisan support, and passed with a final vote of 285-144. The bill now heads to the Senate, where Democrats have indicated it will pass. The White House has also indicated that President Barack Obama would sign the bill. The legislation also attaches a provision aimed at forcing Senate Democrats to take up a budget for the first time in four years. If they do not, a "no budget, no pay" provision would withhold pay for members.  The GOP plan is something of a retreat from previous positions, as Republicans found themselves in a virtual no-win situation by attempting to use the debt ceiling as leverage to force spending cuts from President Barack Obama and other Democrats. During the 2011 debt-ceiling debate, Boehner established the rule in his namesake that said every dollar increase in the debt ceiling had to be accompanied by a corresponding amount of spending cuts. Take a look back through our live blog for various developments throughout the day. &ldquo;You know, the premise here is pretty simple.&nbsp; It says that there should be no long-term increase in the debt limit until there&rsquo;s a long-term plan to deal with the fiscal crisis that faces our country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every hardworking taxpayer in America knows that they have to do a budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every hardworking taxpayer understands that you can&rsquo;t continue to spend money that you don&rsquo;t have.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are committed to continue to do a budget every year.&nbsp; And if you think about this, it&rsquo;s not just that we&rsquo;ve done a budget the last two years that addresses our fiscal crisis, even when the Democrats had control in the two years before that, you all did a budget. And yet for four years &ndash; nearly four years &ndash; the United States Senate has not done a budget.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so this bill before us is real simple.&nbsp; It says, &lsquo;Congress, if you don&rsquo;t do a budget you don&rsquo;t get paid.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have no doubt that we&rsquo;re going to do our work.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re committed to doing a budget and a ten-year plan to solve our budget crisis and to balance our budget.&nbsp; And frankly, I think it&rsquo;s time for the Senate, and the White House, to produce a budget that will balance over the next 10 years.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, most Americans would look up and go, &lsquo;Wait a minute, why do they need 10 years to balance the budget?&rsquo; But we know with baby boomers retiring and the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t prepared for &ndash; it&rsquo;s going to take a little more time.&nbsp; But my goodness, we ought to be able to balance the budget in the next 10 years.&nbsp; &ldquo;Balancing the budget over the next 10 years means that we save the future for our kids and our grandkids.&nbsp; It also means that we strengthen programs like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid that can&rsquo;t continue to exist in their current form without some kind of controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time for Congress to get serious about this and this is the first step in an effort to bring real fiscal responsibility to Washington.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s real simple: no budget, no pay.&nbsp; I yield back.&rdquo; There were 199 Republicans who voted for it, but the 86 Democrats pushed the bill over the top.&nbsp; Here's Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's full statement on the House's passage: &ldquo;I am pleased that Speaker Boehner and his House colleagues have decided to change course, and pass a bill that defuses yet another fight over the debt ceiling. &ldquo;This bill surrenders the hostage Republicans have taken in the past by decoupling the full faith and credit of the United States from cuts to Social Security and Medicare, or anything else.&nbsp; In substance, this is a clean debt limit increase that will set the precedent for future debt ceiling extensions.&nbsp; By passing this bill, Republicans are joining Democrats to say we will not hold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage, and we will pay our bills. &ldquo;Over the last two years, the bipartisan Budget Control Act set spending levels in place of a Congressional Budget.&nbsp; As Senator Murray announced today, this year the Senate will return to regular order, and move a budget resolution through the Budget Committee and to the Senate floor. House Republicans had to add a gimmick or two to get their bill past the Tea Party. But to spare the middle class another knock-down, drag-out fight, the Senate will proceed to and seek to pass the House bill. We will seek an agreement with Republicans to bring the bill to the floor in the coming days. &ldquo;I want to give credit where credit is due, and thank Speaker Boehner for his leadership here in defusing another fight over the debt ceiling. The middle class has been telling us they do not want another crisis, and this bill gives them the security they deserve.&rdquo; FREE AppDownload
