Bloomberg TVThe findings are in. Over 2,600 people responded to Business Insider's survey on financial TV, and question after question Bloomberg TV beat out CNBC and Fox Business News as the preferred channel among those polled. It's a fierce debate in financial circles. CNBC has consistently claimed the top spot, but Bloomberg TV isn't tracked by Nielsen, the ratings pollster, so the true favorite among financial professionals and business news consumers has been unclear. So Business Insider decided to ask its own readers. Respondents answered questions about everything from their favorite anchors, to Maria Bartiromo's recent move to Fox Business News. They gave their opinion on which network has the best tech coverage and their favorite morning show. But there was one crucial question that sums up the entire network battle. Bloomberg TV and CNBC are in a dead heat over who has the best guests. If Bloomberg TV edged ahead in that department, who knows what would happen. FREE AppDownload
