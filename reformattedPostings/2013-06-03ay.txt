LinkedInOn Saturday night, British newspaper the Daily Mail dropped a bombshell report that said Prime Minister David Cameron was dealing with the fallout of a secret love affair between two members of London's political elite. If the Mail is to be believed, Cameron was "stunned" by the news. "This revelation is dynamite," one source told the Mail. "None of us could believe it when we first heard it." There's a catch, however. The Mail didn't reveal the name of the couples for "legal reasons" — this is the U.K., of course, home of the notorious press-silencing "super-injunction" law. And so over the weekend, Britain's media observers have spent a lot of time speculating about who the pair could be. Some Westminster insiders claim to know the answer: If Dave knew it is awful, if he didn't know, it is worse... (Whether they are true or not, both stories are spreading online — with some creative Googling you can find both sets of names on some less-scrupulous websites.) The Mail's article leaves a large number of suspects. The pair are middle-aged, both married, and not serving in David Cameron's cabinet, the upper echelons of British government. It is not clear if they are politicians themselves or how the affair would impact Cameron. The Prime Minister is said to have learned of the affair in the past couple of weeks, but when it happened, and how long it lasted, are not revealed, but the Mail does reveal that the affair is over. With so little information, people have begun to get a little creative.
