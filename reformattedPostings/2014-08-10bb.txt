Flickr/elisfanclubJefferies CEO Richard Handler sent out a clever email to his employees, giving his bankers 10 Wall Street life lessons he wants them to learn this summer. The lessons are in the form of an imagined summer reading list. The books he lists are made-up, but within each title is a lesson he wants everyone to learn. Here's the email he sent to his employees:  In keeping with our strong desire to maintain maximum focus and momentum in August and into our fourth quarter, we came up with a way to make everyone’s life a little easier. When at the beach or in the mountains on vacation, it is always fun to bring along a few good books to help relax, unwind, and stretch the mind. With the goal of saving everyone some time, we have included our list of books we would like everyone to take with them on vacation. The good news is you need only read the titles and merely imagine the hundreds of pages that could fill each volume: Please stay focused in August on building Jefferies and enjoy any time away you may be taking.
