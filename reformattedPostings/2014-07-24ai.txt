REUTERS/Guang NiuIt's hard being a trader shorting stocks. Short sellers, or investors betting that the price of a stock will go down, have to overcome unexpected fees, as well as simple math: you can only ever make 100% on a short position, but your losses are potentially infinite. And just this morning, SodaStream, a stock that is heavily shorted, saw shares pop after Bloomberg reported the company was in talks to go private. But this doesn't stop traders from taking their best shot.  Year-to-date, all of the major stock indexes are higher, with the Nasdaq gaining more than 7.5% and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 adding 7%. Despite these broad gains, we've found 30 stocks with market caps larger than $2 billion that people are betting against like crazy. On the list, of course, is Herbalife, the company that hedge funder Bill Ackman has accused of being a pyramid scheme.  Other high-profile companies on the list include electric carmaker Tesla and yoga apparel maker lululemon.  This list, however, also exhibits two major themes: China and solar energy. We ranked the stock by short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding, going from the least shorted to the most. FREE AppDownload
