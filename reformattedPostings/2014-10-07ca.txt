ShutterstockJob openings rose  to 4.84 million in August. This is according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, at the top of the hour. Expectations were for jobs openings to total 4.7 million, up slight from 4.67 million last month. The report showed that job openings increased in nondurable good manufacturing, health care and social assistance, and in accommodation and food services. Job openings fell in state and local government. This report pegs job openings near a roughly 13-year high. The hiring rate in August fell, however, to 4.6 million from 4.9 million the prior month. The latest JOLTS report also comes on the heels of last Friday's jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate fell to 5.9% as nonfarm payrolls grew by 248,000.  FREE AppDownload
