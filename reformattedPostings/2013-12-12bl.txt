The stock is down by over 10% in pre-market trading. Lululemon reported Q3 earnings of $0.45 per share, beating expectations fo $0.41 per share. During the period, comparable store sales were up 5% at the yoga apparel retailer.  This compares to expectations for a 5.3% gain. "This so far has been a year of challenges, learning, and growth for lululemon, and while our outlook for the fourth quarter is being impacted by both macro and execution issues, I believe that the investments we are making in the business combined with the team in place create a strong platform for growth in the years ahead," said CEO Christine Day. Guidance however, was light. Management expects to earn $0.78 to $0.80 per share in Q4. This range is below analysts' expectation for $0.84. Comparable store sales are expected to be flat during the period. All of this comes as competition intensifies in the yoga-apparel category.
