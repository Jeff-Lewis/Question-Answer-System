The auction house said a collection of Romanee-Conti, one of the world's most sought after Burgundy labels, sold for the equivalent of $14,121 for each bottle or $1,700 per glass. The lot contained six bottles of each of the 19 vintages made from 1992 to 2010. The previous record for a single lot of wine -- also held by Sotheby's -- was $1.05 million for 50 cases of top Bordeaux Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1982, sold in New York in 2006. "The Romanee-Conti Superlot presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire an unprecedented quantity of the world's most desirable wine," Robert Sleigh, head of Sotheby's Wine in Asia, said in a press release. "It is only fitting that it has broken the world record to become the most valuable single wine lot ever sold at auction," he added.  A 66-magnum collection of Henri Jayer, owned by Silicon Valley magnate and Netscape founder James Clark, also sold for $1.1 million, or $16,000 per bottle.  Sotheby's did not release who acquired either lot.  The record sales come despite a much publicised anti-corruption campaign and separate austerity drive by Chinese president Xi Jinping which has hit luxury goods and vintage wine sales in Hong Kong hard. According to a survey by Vinexpo Asia Pacific, mainland China's wine consumption fell by 2.5 percent last year, after 10 years of uninterrupted growth at a rate of 25 percent per year. In 2013, China overtook France as the world's largest consumer of red wine, guzzling more than 155 million 9-litre cases or 1.865 billion bottles that year, according to Vinexpo. But the official austerity drive in China has meant that people are increasingly turning to cheaper wines.   FREE AppDownload
