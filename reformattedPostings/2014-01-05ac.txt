"In order to change forecast-based guidance, all the FOMC has to do is alter the 'dots' that indicate where interest rates are projected to be in the future. Of course, this may overstate the ease with which this can be done in a coordinated manner. Individual FOMC participants submit their forecasts at the beginning of the meeting, making it hard for the Chairperson to use his or her leadership leverage to move the distribution of the dots. Even if moving the dots were to have a meaningful effect on financial conditions, it is hard to see how Yellen could adeptly use this tool to guide market expectations."—Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank FREE AppDownload
