DogecoinThe digital currency that started as a joke is now one of the biggest digital currencies in the world. Dogecoin — which is like Bitcoin but inspired by the absurdist Doge meme — now has a "market cap" of $62 million according to CoinMarketCap.com. When Rob Wile told the story of how Dogecoin came together back in December, the value of all extant Dogecoins were just $8 million. And it's not hard to see why Dogecoin is taking off. The community has done cool things, like help send the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics. The community is also helping send athletes from India to the Sochi games. Meanwhile, the community is incredibly motivated and evangelical, but not in an annoying way. After I tweeted yesterday about the surging value of Doge, a bunch of its fans instantly offered to tip me a bunch (give me some of theirs): @tipdoge tip @TheStalwart 10 #Dogecoin #ToTheMoon @tipdoge tip @TheStalwart 50 doges, thats how we got there buddy @tipdoge tip @TheStalwart 8.0085 doge @tipdoge tip @TheStalwart 20 doge The Doge community isn't likely to become a "mass" thing, but it seems to attract fun people that are into doing cool things. It's not that weird to see why it's taken off so much. FREE AppDownload
