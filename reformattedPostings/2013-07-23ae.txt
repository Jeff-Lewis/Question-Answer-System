REUTERS/Steve Marcus BIG report from WSJ. Reporters Jenny Strasburg and Michael Rothfeld say that prosecutors are set to file criminal charges against the hedge fund SAC Capital. The planned charges against SAC would mark the culmination of a yearslong probe into suspected securities fraud at one of the biggest, most successful hedge-fund firms in the country. The action is anticipated barring any last-minute pact with SAC or other reversal of government strategy, according to people familiar with the matter. As Strasburg and Rothfeld note, this represents the culmination of a long effort to get the firm on insider trading charges. The good news, according to the report, is that the charges are likely to be against the firm, not Cohen himself. Just last week, Cohen was sued by the SEC (a civil action) for failure to properly supervise his traders. The SEC sought to ban Cohen from investing money. At the time that weak charge was seen as something of a "win" for Cohen, although it was clear that he is planning a vigorous defense of that. Over the weekend, Cohen distributed a 46-page white paper internally explaining why the SEC's suit was wrong. You can read that paper here. Already the firm has seen huge investor outflows, and multiple charges against the firm (both criminal and civil) will likely further debilitate it. FREE AppDownload
