Nikolaiii666 / FlickrStocks are way down early in the Asian trading session. Japan's Nikkei is down 0.7 percent. Korea's Kospi is down 0.4 percent. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX is down 1.5 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is down 1.4 percent. China's Shanghai Composite is down 1.7 percent. This falls a steep tumble in the U.S. markets where the Dow fell 108 points.  A disappointing housing starts report, a weak Caterpillar sales report, and a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve's FOMC minutes took a toll on stocks, oil, and gold.
