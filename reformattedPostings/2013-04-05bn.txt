It's jobs day in America. This morning we learned that the U.S. economy added a measly 88,000 jobs in March.  The unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent, but that was due to a big drop in the labor force participation rate. The jobs report was much worse than expected, and it reflects a job market that remains incredibly weak, almost four years into the economic recovery. Calculated Risk runs a chart every month that puts the current jobs recovery into perspective. "This shows the depth of the recent employment recession — worse than any other post-war recession — and the relatively slow recovery due to the lingering effects of the housing bust and financial crisis," writes Bill McBride of Calculated Risk.
