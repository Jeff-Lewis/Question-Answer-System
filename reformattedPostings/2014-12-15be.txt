YouTubeThe video has 1.5 million views.Last week, a group of Columbia Business School students posted a video to YouTube in which a young woman sings – and raps – about getting ahead in the workplace by acting like a "b--ch."  It's already reached 1.5 million views. The video, which parodies Meghan Trainor's "All About That Bass,"  has its critics – some see it as a lame attempt to combat real biases and career obstacles for women. But the students' initial objective in creating the video was simply to entertain. They put it together in their spare time – shooting most of it in a single day – for the CBS Follies, a student-run sketch-comedy group that holds a show at the end of each semester. (It's the same group that released this viral "Single Ladies" parody back in 2010.) "There are particular pieces of performance feedback that women receive that would virtually never be given to a man (“warmth” “nurturing” “abrasive”)," wrote co-director Wes Citti in an email. "We thought this would be a fun idea to explore for a comedy video, to depict women embracing the label 'b--ch' that comes with acting in a hyper-masculine fashion played to the level of absurdity." It's basically a younger, more fun version of the ultra-feminist Pantene commercial that came out in the Philippines a year ago and highlighted male-versus-female stereotypes in the workplace. With a few more swear words. Watch the full Columbia Business School Follies video here:  FREE AppDownload
