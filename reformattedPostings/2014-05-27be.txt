Flickr/snappybexThe markets are higher following the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.  The S&amp;P 500 hit at a new all-time intraday high of 1,911.08, and is currently up 10 points (0.5%) to around 1,910. The Dow is up 74 points (0.45%), and the Nasdaq is up 36 points (0.9%).  Gold is also lower, down more than 1.5% to around $1,270 an ounce.  Earlier this morning, the Case-Shiller home price index posted a month-over-month increase in March that was larger than expected. U.S. durable goods orders also unexpectedly climbed.  Markit's U.S. service activity report came in at 58.4, a two-year high. Markit's private sector service output came in at 58.6, the best reading for that rate since April 2010.  The Conference Board's May consumer confidence reading came in at 83.0, which was in-line with expectations.  The Richmond Fed manufacturing index for May came in at 7, the same as was reported for April. The report said that retail sales gained in May, with big-ticket sales spiking and shopper traffic returning.  The biggest stock news of the day is chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride offering to buy Hillshire Brands in a deal worth $6.4 billion. Shares of Hillshire are up 22% to just north of $45, and Pilgrim's Pride is up about 4% following the announcement. Pinnacle Foods, which Hillshire agreed to acquire earlier this month, is down about 6%, as Pilgrim's offer for Hillshire requires a termination of its deal with Pinnacle.   Over the weekend, Pfizer also walked away from its bid to buy AstraZeneca.
