Oil! It's been a wild day for oil futures amid global financial turbulence spurred by a further collapse in the Russian ruble.  After West Texas Intermediate crude futures cracked $54 for the first time in five years this morning, oil made a huge comeback, breaking above $57 a barrel.  But near 1:30 p.m. Eastern time, WTI was back near $55.50, roughly unchanged over the last day.  US stocks have also been volatile, with the Dow gaining as much as 235 points after opening down about 100 points. Near 12:30 pm Eastern time, the Dow was up 140.  The big story in the market, however, remains the price of crude oil, which has been getting smashed in the last few months and has seen losses accelerate in the last couple of weeks. And while today isn't the first time crude has bounced higher before returning lower, those closely watching the market are looking for any signs of a bottom. But as Jeff Gundlach said last week, "Oil will find a bottom when it starts going up." FinViz      FREE AppDownload
