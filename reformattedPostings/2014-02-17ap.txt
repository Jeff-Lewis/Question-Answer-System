Wikimedia CommonsMIT's Simmons Hall in Cambridge, Mass.Four students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are facing a New Jersey fraud investigation for a Bitcoin mining project created at a hackathon. But despite the legality of the students' invention, MIT has been accused of not immediately rallying behind its students and their innovative work.  Two anonymous-yet-prominent university figures are seeking signatures for a letter addressed to MIT president Rafael Reif, which criticizes the university for not supporting the students. According to the letter, MIT’s lawyers told the students they would not get involved in a case that didn’t directly involve the university. However, MIT provost Martin Schmidt said the university advised the students to get their own lawyers and MIT would support them as best they could, according to The Boston Globe. The students’ invention, called "Tidbit," would allow Internet users to loan computing power to website owners for the sake of mining Bitcoins in exchange for not seeing ads on the site. Tidbit is still a prototype, but according to the Globe, New Jersey authorities subpoenaed Tidbit’s developers for source code and documents related to the project, and are investigating whether the project violates New Jersey’s consumer fraud act.  Tidbit’s case parallels that of Aaron Swartz, a former MIT student who killed himself in January 2013 after facing federal felony charges related to downloading millions of academic journal articles on the university’s network. Critics at the time said MIT should have done more to support his legal battle.  In response to the criticism, MIT president Reif issued his own letter claiming Tidbit has the support of MIT and that the university should provide students with better resources for legal counsel.  FREE AppDownload
