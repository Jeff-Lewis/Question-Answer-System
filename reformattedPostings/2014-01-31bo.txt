REUTERS/ Pascal LauenerGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein will earn $23 million for 2013, the Financial Times' Camilla Hall and Stephen Foley report. That's a 10% increase. From the FT: Mr Blankfein was awarded 88,422 in restricted share units, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that are worth $14.7m based on Goldman’s closing share price of $165.84 on Thursday. The restricted stock units, which typically total about 70 per cent of his bonus, mean he is expected to be paid another $6.3m in cash. That is in addition to his $2m salary, taking his overall package to $23m. Blankfein rival and JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also got a raise (amid the bank's legal troubles) after taking a massive $11.5 million pay cut in 2012.
