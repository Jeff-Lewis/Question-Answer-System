Getting your Masters in Business Administration is tough work and expensive to boot, which is why the question everyone asks about the degree is, "Is it worth it?" If the promise of higher pay after school is what you're looking for, new stats show that the answer to that question could be no, the WSJ reports. From WSJ: The M.B.A.'s lot is partly reflected in starting pay. While available figures vary by schools and employers, recruiters' expected median salary for newly hired M.B.A.s was essentially flat between 2008 and 2011, not adjusting for inflation, according to a survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council. For graduates with minimal experience—three years or less—median pay was $53,900 in 2012, down 4.6% from 2007-08, according to an analysis conducted for The Wall Street Journal by PayScale.com. Pay fell at 62% of the 186 schools examined. Even for more seasoned grads the trend is similar, says Katie Bardaro, lead economist for PayScale.com. "In general, it seems that M.B.A. pay is either stagnant or falling," she says. Of course, the more prestigious your MBA program is, the more likely it is that you'll get paid better once you get out. The competition is fierce, though. In 2010-2011, the number of graduating MBAs was 74 percent higher than it was in 2000-2001. Not encouraging.
