Royal Dutch Shell declined to comment, while BP was unavailable for comment. "BP shares have rallied on the back of enthusiastic buying on talk of Shell's interest in the company," said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG. "But it seems difficult to believe that Shell would make such a big acquisition at this difficult time for the oil market."
