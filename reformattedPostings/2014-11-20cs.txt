Students were first urged to seek shelter by a university telephone alert warning of a "dangerous situation" at the main campus. "We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter," freshman Anthony Coons told the Tallahassee Democrat.  Cell phone camera footage uploaded to YouTube captured the scene inside the library at the time of the shooting. "There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are," a person over the loudspeaker says.  Blair Stokes, a student at the university, was in the library at the time of the emergency and tweeted updates of the situation.   FREE AppDownload
