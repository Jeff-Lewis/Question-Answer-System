Wikimedia Commons Nick Griffin is the leader of the British National Party (BNP), a far right U.K. political party that evolved out of the neo-fascist National Front. Today, on Twitter, he announced that he was bankrupt — but, he added, it would not effect his work as a member of the European Parliament, and he was happy about it: A note for all: Being bankrupt does NOT prevent me being or standing as an MEP. It does free me from financial worries. A good day! If you've noticed a lot of schadenfreude amongst British journalists on Twitter, it might help to understand a little bit of Griffin's backstory. While the BNP strives to present a less radical far right view that the National Front (think of them as a less consequential version of Marine Le Pen's National Front), Griffin has been accused of a variety of prejudiced views, including racism and holocaust denial. As such, Griffin has had to endure a lot on Twitter today: Morally, politically and now financially bankrupt too. Unhappy New Year, odious Nick Griffin Nick Griffin has been declared bankrupt, which is bad news for the English language, as it means he has more time to dedicate to his poetry. Happy New Year, everyone!
