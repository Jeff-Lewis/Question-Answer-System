Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesConstruction spending climbed by just 0.1% in May, which was below the 0.5% growth rate expected by economists. However, April's growth rate was revised up to 0.8% from 0.2%. May's growth was driven by a 1.0% increase in public construction. "In one line: Housing finally falters; state and local government rebounding strongly," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson. "The details show new housing construction, ex-home improvement, fell 1.2% in May, the first outright decline since Sep 11," he added. "New housing construction has been running ahead of the pace implied by new home sales so we have been waiting for this decline for some time."
