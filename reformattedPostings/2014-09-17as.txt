Ninety-three percent of the world’s billionaires are over 45 years old.

Male billionaires vastly outnumber female billionaires, by a ratio of seven to one. On average, they are married and predominantly self-made.  Wealth-X and USB Billionaire Census ReportFemale billionaires are less likely to be married, and roughly 2/3 inherited their wealth.
