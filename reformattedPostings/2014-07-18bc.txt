Google Street View/David Coates/The Detroit NewsThe transformation of Garland Street from 2007 to 2014. Editor's note: This post originally appeared at DetroitNews.com. We are grateful to them for allowing us to republish an abbreviated version here.  Detroit has averaged 4,000 to 5,000 suspicious fires a year since 2000. The vast majority are believed to be intentional. Authorities say they are able to investigate only about a third of the suspicious fires because of limited resources. Of those, insurance fraud remains the top motive. Revenge is No. 2: 300 of 1,500 investigated cases last year were considered acts of revenge. Garland Street has been particularly hard hit. In the one-mile stretch between the two fires that consumed nine homes last month, at least 21 homes show obvious signs of fire damage. “They’ve been burning everything up. It’s crazy,” said John Kiner, who has lived next door to Arnold on the east side of the street for 10 years. The latest spark on Garland began when police arrested Sylvestor D. Ford, 27, for torching a neighbor’s car. His rap sheet includes convictions for operating a chop shop, felonious assault and receiving and concealing stolen property. Hours after he was jailed, the home he was staying in at 4511 Garland was intentionally set on fire in the middle of the night, investigators say. By the time firefighters arrived, the 710-square-foot house was engulfed. So was the vacant house next door. Charles Simms, arson chief of the Detroit Fire Department, said he’s hopeful Detroit is improving. His squad brought aboard nine new investigators last month, practically doubling its size. The investigators are now concentrated in designated areas of the city to better spot trends. Simms also said Mayor Mike Duggan’s anti-blight efforts will reduce arson.
