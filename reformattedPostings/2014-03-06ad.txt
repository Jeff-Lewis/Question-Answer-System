Forbes recently released its 28th annual ranking of the world’s billionaires. This list of the wealthiest people in the world revealed that there are a total of 1,645 billionaires. According to the list, Bill Gates has regained his position as the wealthiest man in the world. It appears Bill was hard at work last year. His net worth is now at $76 billion, which is a big jump from last year when it was a mere $67 million. Despite being known around the world as the richest man, he has not been at the top of the list in the past four years. Even so, he still has ranked at the top for 15 out of the last 20 years. Last year he was second in the world, just behind the telecom billionaire, Carlos Slim Helu. Where do the top 10 wealthiest people in the world rank? Get a glimpse of the richest people and the sources of their wealth. Mark Zuckerberg: A notable mention not yet in the top 10 billionaires is Mark Zuckerberg. The creator of Facebook is currently ranked number 21 on the list of wealthiest people in the world, but it’s worth noting he was able to significantly increase his fortune this year. Currently, Zuckerberg’s net worth is at $28.5 billion, up from $13.3 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion, which is one of the biggest gains among billionaires since last year. Expect Zuckerberg to work his way to the top 10 and remain there within the next five years or so.
