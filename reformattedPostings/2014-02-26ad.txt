One of the major advantages of living in a city rather than in the suburbs is walkability. In a dense urban neighborhood, many services and amenities are within a short walking distance. In a less dense, suburban neighborhood, parks, stores, and neighbors might only be accessible by driving. These two maps made by the sustainability research center Sightline Institute, which popped up on Reddit, and were originally posted on the website of walkability analysis company Walk Score, dramatically illustrate the differences. The maps show, in blue, the range of places within a mile's walk from the central star location. There is a much wider range of places to go and things to do within a walking mile in the city than in the suburban neighborhood. The pink lots on the map are commercial and retail spots, and there are clearly far more options available to the urban pedestrian.  On the left is a suburban neighborhood in Bellevue, WA, and on the right is a neighborhood in Seattle.  Sightline Institute Thanks to Sightline Institute for giving us permission to feature these maps.
