Facebook made a breathtaking move yesterday, buying messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion. Even for Facebook, that's a staggering amount to pay for a company with estimated 2013 revenue of only $20 million. It represents almost 10% of Facebook's overall value — for a "messaging app." So in the wake of the announcement, the usual chorus of keyboard pundits took to Twitter to snicker together and pronounce Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, brain dead. But Facebook buying WhatsApp for $19 billion isn't a brain dead move. It's just bold. Very bold. Like other bold moves, Facebook's WhatsApp deal could end up looking brilliant. Or moronic. That's what makes it bold. If it were guaranteed to end up looking brilliant, it wouldn't be bold. It would be obvious, safe, and boring. And Facebook hasn't built a service used by one-sixth of the world's population in 10 years by being obvious, safe, and boring. I don't know how Facebook's WhatsApp deal will end up looking — and neither, it's worth noting, do any of the pundits who are pronouncing it brain dead. Based on everything I do know, though, I think the odds are that it will end up looking brilliant. Here's why: Yes, but is WhatsApp really worth $19 billion? The short answer is: No one knows. There are some financial scenarios in which WhatsApp could end up being "worth" (in a limited financial sense) a lot more than $19 billion. There are other scenarios in which it could end up being worth a lot less. The only answerable question right now is whether WhatsApp was worth $19 billion to Facebook. And I think the answer is yes. The bottom line: This is a very bold move. Like other bold moves, it might end up looking stupid, but it also might end up looking brilliant.  It's also a long-term move, a bet on what the future will look like five to 10 years from now, not next quarter. In that way, this deal is a vintage Mark Zuckerberg move. Zuckerberg continues to be one of the few CEOs (Jeff Bezos is another) who is willing to sacrifice near-term earnings and expose himself to short-term ridicule in order to make bold long-term bets. This approach has worked out great for Amazon And it has worked out great for Facebook so far.  In short, Facebook buying WhatsApp for $19 billion isn't stupid. It's just bold. FREE AppDownload
