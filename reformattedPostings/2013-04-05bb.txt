For many, central banks act in mysterious ways. Yet these enigmatic institutions have emerged as THE leaders in economic policy formulation around the world. More accurately, central banks have been pushed into a role that they did not seek and that they are less than fully equipped to deliver on.  And their impact is significant. Just witness how the Bank of Japan’s U-turn is realigning the pecking order in markets, shaping new political narratives, and making “experts” revisit many of their priors. You should have no doubt. From the security of your job to the wellbeing of your 401K, and from the safety of your financial savings to the value of your home, central banks are touching you in multiple ways. This reality will get more intense in coming months. But its ultimate outcome is also quite uncertain. So here are a few things to remember: In enjoying the ride on this huge wave of global central bank liquidity, investors should not lose sight of two key elements:  We all want central banks to succeed in promoting economic growth and enhancing job creation. There is a lot at stake, for both current and future generations. Such success would also allow for economic and company fundamentals to validate current artificial pricing in many market segments. Should success prove elusive, however, the major investment theme will pivot quite suddenly: From the benefits of riding the huge liquidity waves to the urgent importance of minimizing exposure to collateral damage and taking advantage of the inevitable market overshoots. In closing, remember this simple analogy: Central banks these days are like a pharmaceutical company that feels compelled to bring to market medication that has not been clinically tested. In eagerly taking the medication, investors should focus not just on the immediate upside and its durability, but also on the longer-term impact of potential side effects. FREE AppDownload
