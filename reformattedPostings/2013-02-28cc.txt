Bloomberg TVBloomberg TV's sassy, smart, and outspoken Stephanie Ruhle has been on air for a short time, but she already has a loyal following on Wall Street. Every weekday, Ruhle acts as a foil to her straight-laced co-host, Erik Schatzker on Market Makers. A former banker herself, she's not only known for her easy manner with some of the biggest names in the business, but also for her scoops. It was Ruhle, after all, who harpooned the London Whale. For all those reasons and more, Business Insider asked her to take us on a tour of her life. Ruhle was kind enough to oblige. The day starts at 5:35 a.m. and does not stop until around 11:00 p.m., or maybe later. "If I'm lucky 11 p.m. ... I go out a lot at night and usually I return after my kids go to bed," Ruhle told Business Insider. "But if I'm home and try to be disciplined, it usually fails and I get sucked into watching the newest episode of Girls." We've all been there. FREE AppDownload
