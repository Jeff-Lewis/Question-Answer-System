 Uber has hired Goldman Sachs to raise money from the bank's high-net-worth clients, Fortune's Dan Primack reports. Primack reports that Goldman began sending information packets on Uber to its wealth management clients Monday morning and that the bank could raise "hundreds of millions of dollars to support Uber's balance sheet and international expansion efforts." The securities being offered by Goldman to clients are structured as convertible debt, Primack reports. This news follows a report from Bloomberg last week that said Uber was close to raising a new round of funding that would value the company at $35 billion to $40 billion. That raise was reported to include investments from companies including T. Rowe Price. Primack's report also said it wasn't clear what Goldman's clients were being told, given that a convertible debt offering is an odd choice for a company that is neither trading on a secondary market nor promising an IPO.  But regardless of Uber's ambitions with regard to taking its company public, the company's growth trajectory is impressive.  Earlier this month, Business Insider's Henry Blodget, citing a source familiar with the company's financial performance, reported that Uber's revenue was expected to hit an annual run rate of $10 billion next year. In other words, Uber is expected to have a quarter in which it brings in $2.5 billion in revenue by the end of next year. And while reports have circulated in recent months about the company being in talks to raise money, Uber's most recent confirmed capital raise put the company's valuation at $17 billion, about half of the figure being discussed now.   FREE AppDownload
