We also expect further improvement in both HSBC and NBS/CFLP PMI in coming months. Many Street economists will likely to revise up their overly pessimistic 3Q GDP growth forecasts soon. We are confident to maintain our 7.6% yoy GDP growth forecasts for 3Q and 7.5% for 4Q.

That said, good data in July and August also means that markets should not expect a big stimulus package." He also said the breakdown of the report showed that this was driven by an improvement in domestic demand, rather than external demand.
