Mike Segar / ReutersJim Chanos, Founder and Managing Partner of Kynikos Associates LP speaks at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook summit in New York, November 19, 2013.Jim Chanos — who famously shorted Enron before the company collapsed — has a new "large" short position in CGI Group, Newsweek's Lynnley Browning reports.
