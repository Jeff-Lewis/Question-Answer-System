Economist Dean Baker is ready to call the May non-farm payrolls report that's due out on Friday: It's going to be terrible. 100,000 jobs on Friday. You heard it hear first -- that's what I e-mailed to a colleague last night before the weak ADP report. We emailed Dean to ask him why he's such a jobs bear. The main takeaway is that 2 percent GDP growth isn't enough to support the current pace of job growth, and so job growth is going to have to slow. Here's his full email: I don't expect much action on the goods side of the market -- we had essentially zero growth there last month and likely a small negative this month (shrinking manufacturing). I think last month's growth in personal and business services was an aberration, which means that there will be some mean reversion with low or even negative growth this month. Restaurant and retail employment growth were also unusually high, so I look to lower numbers there as well. There were no obvious aberrations on the low side last month, except the information sector had a very small loss -- that may revert upward, but it won't offset downward shifts elswehere. So I'd put 100,000 as my best guess.BTW, with GDP growth hovering around 2.0 percent, we really shouldn't expect much employment growth. It wasn't too long ago that we had productivity growth higher than this. FREE AppDownload
