REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonChinese GDP slowed to 7.5% in the second quarter, confirming fears of an economic slowdown. But Chinese premier Li Keqiang helped calm markets this week by saying that 7.5% is the growth floor for 2013. China is trying to support sectors of the economy that will drive growth. Most recently China's industry minister announced that sectors like steel, aluminum, cement and other sectors that are burdened by excess capacity, will be restructured.  Lu points out that these measures are "a small stimulus with both Keynesian measures to increase aggregate demand and supply-side measures such as cutting tax and red tape." He also points out that this time around we're not seeing massive monetary easing, and that the spending is focused on areas that need investment. FREE AppDownload
