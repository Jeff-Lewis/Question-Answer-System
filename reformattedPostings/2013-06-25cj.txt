Markets were plummeting in Shanghai early in the Tuesday section, but came back late in the day. The savior was the People's Bank of China, which finally is taking a more active stance towards the extreme liquidity crunch that had engulfed the Chinese banking sector in recent days.

He didn't elaborate on what constituted a reasonable range, though he said the central bank would be flexible in managing interbank liquidity.
