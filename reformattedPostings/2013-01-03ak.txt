Tory Burch is officially a billionaire. Her ex-husband Chris sold some of his stake in her company last week, ending an acrimonious legal battle and securing Tory's status as a billionaire.  The women's apparel company she started in 2004 is now worth an estimated $3.5 billion, making her 28.3 percent stake worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes.  She could be worth even more if the company decides to go public, something that many industry people speculate could happen now that her legal battle is over.  Tory Burch LLC brought in $800 million in revenues in 2012, according to Forbes. By comparison, Michael Kors brought in $800 million in revenues in 2011, went public that year, and is now worth $10 billion.  Burch started her business in her kitchen 10 years ago. Today, she is famous for her Reva ballet flats, which are a staple among working women.  Congratulations, Tory!
