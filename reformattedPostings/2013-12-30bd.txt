REUTERS/Richard ClementPending home sales climbed 0.2% month-over-month in November. But were down 4% on the year. This missed economists' expectations for a 1% monthly rise and 0.1% year-over-year fall. There were also downward revisions to October's data, with pending home sales falling 1.2% on the month, and 2.7% on the year. This compares with an initial reading of a 2.2% YoY fall in October, and a 0.6% month-over-month fall. "We may have reached a cyclical low because the positive fundamentals of job creation and household formation are likely to foster a fairly stable level of contract activity in 2014," Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, said in a press release."Although the final months of 2013 are finishing on a soft note, the year as a whole will end with the best sales total in seven years." Here's a look at the regional breakdown: Pending home sales have been falling for four straight months on account of tighter inventory, declining affordability, and elevated mortgage rates. The index is considered to be a leading indicator for future existing home sales. The Commerce Department expects that 80% of signings will become existing home sales transactions within two months.
