Bloomberg TVNevada brothel owner Dennis Hof went on Bloomberg TV's Market Makers today to decry Craiglist and sum up the state of American prostitution. Hof was a mainstay on "Cathouse," an HBO documentary series on his Moonlight BunnyRanch brothel. Prostitution isn't recession-proof, but Hof — who owns seven legally-operated brothels — said he's actually seen an uptick in business over the past few years. In fact, business is so good Hof now wants an IPO. "I'm buying every brothel I can and want to turn it into a public company," Hof said. "It's going to be a great, successful public company." In the colorful interview, Hof also said that Bill Clinton and Eliot Spitzer would have had better luck keeping their infidelities secret if they chose his establishment.
