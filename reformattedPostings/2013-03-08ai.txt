Art Cashin, UBS's Financial Services director of NYSE floor operations, is a legend at the Big Board.  He's also known across the Street for his must-read daily newsletter Cashin's Comments.  At the end of each newsletter, Cashin includes a fun piece of trivia. The questions are usually a piece of logic or math or history related. They're a ton of fun, but they can be really tricky. He doesn't reveal the answer until the following newsletter comes out.  We've included a round up of a bunch of Cashin's recent brain teasers in the slides that follow.  Remember, Google is for cheaters!  FREE AppDownload
