Despite an average EPS Beat Rate of 79% and an average Revenue Beat Rate of 82%, Google (GOOG) historically dropped precipitously more than 75% of the time in the week (seven calendar days) following its earnings reports over the last four quarters, losing an average of 5.38%. This is a far more substantial drop than either the market or the tech sector as a whole, neither of which decline substantially more than 1.5% over the same period.   Even when the earnings releases over the last eight quarters are taken into account, Google still declines more precipitously than the market as a whole over the following week, losing an average of 2.03%, compared to an average 0.23% overall decline in the Nasdaq over the same period. Most strikingly, over the last eight earnings releases, Google declines during the following week more than 60% of the time.
