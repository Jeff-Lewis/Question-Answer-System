George Guina of Fort WashakieGood morning! Earlier this morning, markets were basically flat. Not things are turning more red. German stocks are off 0.7%. The UK is off 0.4%. US futures are down a tiny bit. The Chinese stock market was flat. Japan rallied .9%, and Russian stocks, after surging yesterday, are up another 0.6% today. Gold and silver are getting whacked a bit.  In the US we get housing starts and CPI data, both of which are always worth paying attention to. FREE AppDownload
