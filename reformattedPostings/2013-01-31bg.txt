New Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is undoubtedly one of the politicians that big banks fear the most. But, in the spirit of bipartisanship, it appears as though Sen. Warren has reached out to a new friend from across the aisle in the Senate: Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. The pair originally got to know each other and became friendly during the drafting of Dodd-Frank. Politico reports that their relationship is part of an ongoing, informal effort to improve working relations in the Senate. Both are members of the Senate Banking Committee. Warren has long been known as an outspoken defender of consumers, while Corker has reportedly shown interest in – yet failed to complete – bipartisan deals on financial policy. The two have already had a meeting, but Corker said they haven't started talking policy – yet. A former GOP aide indicated that Sen. Corker was the right person for Sen. Warren to reach out to, saying “The thing about Bob Corker is that he’s kind of an unconventional member. ... He’s willing to take stances that are kind of unconventional at times from the standpoint of party wisdom.” FREE AppDownload
