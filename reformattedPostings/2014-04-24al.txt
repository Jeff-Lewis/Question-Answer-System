On Friday I did a piece titled “There is NOT a Credit Bubble” and just this morning, I recommended cutting all CDX IG22 shorts, and going long Credit – with IG CDS as the favorite way, followed by AAA CLO or off the run high yield and leveraged loans. There will still be trading opportunities to get short credit, I just don’t think that now is the time, and although I think we are not in a bubble, the easy money has been made and we are closer to the top than the bottom of the cycle.
