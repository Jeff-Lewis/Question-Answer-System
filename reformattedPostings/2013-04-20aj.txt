Jim ChanosJim Chanos gave a devastating presentation on China at Mish Shedlock's Wine Country Conference. Chanos has been bearish on China for quite a while.  However, his new presentation is particularly fascinating because it has some pretty graphic cartoons. "The cartoons/illustrations, gruesome/silly, as they are, are FROM Chinese sources!" said Chanos in an email to Business Insider.  "That's why we put them in-so that people know that the media inside China is becoming more skeptical itself." Chanos has shared this presentation with the WCC and now with us for the benefit of the amazing Les Turner ALS Foundation.  Read more about it here. The Wine Country Conference was hosted by Mike Shedlock of Mish’s Global Economic Trend Analysis and Sitka Pacific Capital Management to raise funds in the fight against ALS, the disease that took Mish’s wife Joanne.  In total, Mish has raised nearly a half million dollars for the Les Turner ALS Foundation —  please consider making a donation.
