Robert Scoble / FlickrTesla reported adjusted earnings of $0.12 per share, This beat expectations of $0.03 per share. Sales were up 83% from the last quarter, to $562 million.

Tesla reaching profitability so quickly provides proof that if you build vehicles that not only look great but are enjoyable to drive, consumers will purchase them,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book in an email.

The company expects to build over 5,000 model S units in Q1, and expects to build another 5,000 in Q2. It also expects 21,000 deliveries in 2013, up from 20,000.

While Tesla's sales target of 20,000 vehicles this year may be achievable, The Wall Street Journal points out that the thing to watch for is what's behind the company's margin. They argue that much of the margin is driven by government subsidies and that it could vanish if the government changed its plans.
