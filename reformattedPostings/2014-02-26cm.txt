Flickr/RednuhtRead this from BTIG's Dan Greenhaus (@danBTIG): Weather aside, while many are fixated on the collapse of nat gas (down 18.5% in two sessions) the rise in TSLA or the complete reversal in the CNY (getting ready for a wider trading band?), another development bears watching and that’s the rally in the retailers. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 6% since its 2014 low but specialty retailers? +8.3. The XRT ETF is up 8% since its low. Consumers -- and consumption -- have been a major worry for investors and as such, the reversal in these shares is something to watch as evidence investors are looking beyond near term concerns. Yep, these are the stories: Natural gas, Tesla, the Chinese yuan, and the stock market recovery. That's also interesting about specialty retailers as a sign of underlying optimism. FREE AppDownload
