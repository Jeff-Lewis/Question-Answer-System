REUTERS/Keith BedfordWelcome to Business Insider's newest section: Education. From pre-K to graduate school, our education system is in a period of rapid change. With skyrocketing tuition, plummeting acceptance rates, and questionable job prospects, a college degree has never before been so controversial. And the road getting there isn't so clear cut, either.  We'll cover these issues and more, bringing you a frank look at what's going on at every level of education.  If you want to know about major news on college campuses, the latest conversation on education policy, or what parents of K-12 students are discussing, we'll have it here. But don't worry, we'll also have some fun here. From fraternity fails to sorority snafus and every other cringe-worthy collegiate scandal, we'll work to uncover the seedy underbelly of higher education. We'll also have tons of features, from a tour of the most beautiful college campus in New York City to a candid look at the real most expensive colleges in the U.S. Got a hot tip or a story idea (or just want to say hi)? Shoot us an email at colleges@businessinsider.com. And, of course, be sure to follow us on Twitter at @BI_University for everything education-related. FREE AppDownload
