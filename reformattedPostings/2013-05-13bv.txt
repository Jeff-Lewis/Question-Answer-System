Sandy Huffaker/Getty ImagesThe week is starting off with a bang.  We just got the April reading of U.S. retail sales. The headline number unexpectedly climbed 0.1%.  Economists were looking for a 0.3% decline, largely due to falling gas prices. Excluding autos and gas, sales jumped by 0.6%, beating expectations for a modest 0.3% gain. From the Census: The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for April, adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading-day differences, but not for price changes, were $419.0 billion, an increase of 0.1 percent (±0.3%)* from the previous month, and 3.7 percent (±0.7%) above April 2012. Total sales for the February through April 2013 period were up 3.7 percent (±0.5%) from the same period a year ago. The February to March 2013 percent change was revised from -0.4 percent (±0.5%)* to -0.5 percent (±0.2%). Retail trade sales were virtually unchanged (±0.5%)* from March 2013 and 3.6 percent (±0.7%) above last year. Nonstore retailers were up 15.4 percent (±2.0) from April 2012 and auto and other motor vehicle dealers were up 8.8 percent (±2.0) from last year.
