Two weeks ago, Eugene Fama, Lars Hansen and Robert Shiller were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for their contributions to "Trendspotting in Asset Markets." Since then, some thinkers have questioned whether economics deserves to be called a "science". Here is a round-up of their arguments: Liam Halligan (Telegraph UK): "Time to stop this pretence – economics is not science"  "Economics is a study of human behaviour – above all, the allocation of scarce resources between competing ends. It requires the analysis of economic, commercial and financial life in all its institutional richness, or it is nothing. A solid grounding in theory and numeracy is essential but so, too, are broad dashes of politics, history, sociology and common sense. Recent “Nobel” recipients have been rewarded, instead, for work that claims to have established “certainties”, made “findings” and discovered “relationships” – all of which, when it comes to economics, is bunkum." Raj Chetty (New York Times): "Yes, Economics Is a Science" "Consider the politically charged question of whether extending unemployment benefits increases unemployment rates by reducing workers’ incentives to return to work. Nearly a dozen economic studies have analyzed this question by comparing unemployment rates in states that have extended unemployment benefits with those in states that do not. These studies approximate medical experiments in which some groups receive a treatment — in this case, extended unemployment benefits — while “control” groups don’t." Paul Krugman (New York Times)- "Maybe Economics Is A Science, But Many Economists Are Not Scientists" Whoever can put an end to this debate may or may not deserve a Nobel Prize. FREE AppDownload
