Tory Burch is a notable addition to the annual Forbes billionaire list.  The women's apparel company she started in 2004 is now worth an estimated $3.5 billion, making her 28.3 percent stake worth over $1 billion. Burch could be worth even more if the company decides to go public, something that many industry people speculate could happen now that her legal battle with ex-husband Chris Burch is over.  Tory Burch LLC brought in $800 million in revenues in 2012, according to Forbes. By comparison, Michael Kors brought in $800 million in revenues in 2011, went public that year, and is now worth $10 billion.  Burch started her business in her kitchen 10 years ago. Today, she is famous for her Reva ballet flats, which are a staple among working women.  At 46, she's the second youngest self-made female billionaire. The youngest is Spanx founder Sara Blakely, 42.  FREE AppDownload
