Fox BusinessA group of anonymous traders provoked Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino into an odd Twitter spat this morning. The fight began with the always sardonic and often hysterical cadre of traders mocking Gasparino for being a "troll" and probably "walking in the Bronx yelling obscenities." That's when Gasparino, who had been going back and forth with a few accounts for a few days now, responded in kind. @CGasparino @nopat @muckbearpig @Tags_ZH @convert_trader @VgsJake @CalConfidence @cr3dit @zerohedge lol Like reporting noise? No not yet @MarketPlunger might have been referring to this recent Gasparino dispatch about Preet Bharara having dinner, which raised eyebrows for being an article about Preet Bharara having dinner. Gasparino went on to essentially call the traders poor.  @nopat @MarketPlunger @MUCKTRADINGBEAR @muckbearpig @Tags_ZH @convert_trader to be young useless unemployed broke at least twitter is free @nopat @MarketPlunger @CalConfidence @LeftHash @Tags_ZH @convert_trader not as good as that etrade acct ur working for grannie @convert_trader @nopat @cr3dit @MarketPlunger @CalConfidence @LeftHash @Tags_ZH just one problem im the only one w disposable income You can't win, Charlie.
