THE ESSENTIAL EIGHT Li Huabo, Corrupt Chinese Bureaucrat or Fall Guy? - Businessweek very interesting story..he has to be guilty of something, no? While the wealth and misbehavior of senior Communist Party officials and their families have received international attention, the more insidious forms of official corruption take place at the local level. Tales of corruption have become the stuff of popular roman à clef novels such as The Diary of Government Official Hou Weidong, written by a mid-level sanitation official, which describes a culture of endemic graft. Rarely, however, do outsiders hear directly from bureaucrats caught up in corruption cases. Li told his story to Bloomberg Businessweek during a four-hour interview at his home in Singapore. He maintains he’s innocent of the charges against him—a fall guy, not a crook. His story provides a glimpse of the pervasiveness of influence peddling at all levels of China’s bureaucracy and shows how difficult it is to stop abuses that have become an accepted part of doing business.[<U+89C6><U+9891>]“<U+4E09><U+5305>”<U+670D><U+52A1><U+7F29><U+6C34> “<U+82F9><U+679C>”<U+7F18><U+4F55><U+9738><U+6C14><U+FF1F>_<U+65B0><U+95FB><U+9891><U+9053>_<U+592E><U+89C6><U+7F51> no respite for Apple in China on Good Friday.

It is no good for either side that the issue is gradually turning political...Had Apple been more sincere in its response to the criticism, the result could have been different. The statement Apple made right after the CCTV exposé was very different with that of other multinational companies who were also reported to have consumer rights issues. With the sheer weight of the company behind it, Apple's detached tone could easily be seen as proof of arrogance. Apple has won respect from Chinese consumers with its perseverance in developing leading technologies and styles. But the company is not impeccable...Apple should not follow the media speculation and consider itself the target of political persecution. ..If the issue developed into a head-on confrontation between Apple and the Chinese authorities, the US company will never be a winner, nor will China necessarily do well. Of course, Apple will suffer the most, as its products are already facing increasing competition in China. //the original OpEd, translation not exact <U+793E><U+8BC4>:<U+82F9><U+679C><U+5E94><U+907F><U+514D><U+56F4><U+7ED5><U+5B83><U+7684><U+98CE><U+6CE2><U+6269><U+5927><U+5316>_<U+8BC4><U+8BBA>_<U+73AF><U+7403><U+7F51> interesting global times editorial "advises" apple 2 act 2 prevent china "crisis" from expanding // <U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8><U+9760><U+7740><U+79D1><U+6280><U+548C><U+65F6><U+5C1A><U+521B><U+65B0><U+95EF><U+5929><U+4E0B>,<U+4E5F><U+8D62><U+5F97><U+4E86><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5927><U+91CF><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+7684><U+5C0A><U+656C><U+3002><U+4F46><U+82F9><U+679C><U+4E0D><U+662F><U+5B8C><U+7F8E><U+65E0><U+7F3A><U+7684><U+3002><U+4E0D><U+65AD><U+6539><U+8FDB><U+6280><U+672F><U+3001><U+4E0D><U+65AD><U+63D0><U+5347><U+670D><U+52A1><U+8D28><U+91CF><U+5BF9><U+5B83><U+6765><U+8BF4><U+4E5F><U+6C38><U+65E0><U+6B62><U+5883><U+3002><U+8FD9><U+5E94><U+662F><U+6211><U+4EEC><U+8BA4><U+8BC6><U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8>,<U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+8BA4><U+8BC6><U+82F9><U+679C><U+540C><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5A92><U+4F53><U+5173><U+7CFB><U+7684><U+57FA><U+7840><U+3002><U+5904><U+5728><U+82F9><U+679C><U+8FD9><U+6837><U+7684><U+9AD8><U+4F4D><U+4E0A>,<U+56DE><U+5E94><U+6279><U+8BC4><U+79EF><U+6781><U+800C><U+5BCC><U+6709><U+5F39><U+6027>,<U+5E94><U+662F><U+4E00><U+79CD><U+57FA><U+672C><U+6001><U+5EA6><U+3002><U+4E2D><U+7F8E><U+5B58><U+5728><U+6587><U+5316><U+5DEE><U+5F02>,<U+5F7C><U+6B64><U+6C9F><U+901A>,<U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+8BC4><U+4F30><U+5BF9><U+65B9><U+6001><U+5EA6><U+5B58><U+5728><U+5929><U+7136><U+7684><U+969C><U+788D>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+9700><U+8981><U+66F4><U+52A0><U+8C28><U+614E><U+3002><U+82F9><U+679C><U+98CE><U+6CE2><U+4EE5><U+666E><U+901A><U+7EA0><U+7EB7><U+5F00><U+59CB>,<U+4E5F><U+5E94><U+4EE5><U+975E><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+7684><U+65B9><U+5F0F><U+7ED3><U+675F><U+3002><U+897F><U+65B9><U+5A92><U+4F53><U+731C><U+6D4B><U+82F9><U+679C><U+662F><U+4E2D><U+7F8E><U+8D38><U+6613><U+7EA0><U+7EB7><U+7684>“<U+66FF><U+7F6A><U+7F8A>”,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+5E94><U+5F53><U+8EB2><U+907F><U+8FD9><U+6837><U+7684><U+5BF9><U+53F7><U+5165><U+5EA7><U+3002><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+7684>“<U+679C><U+7C89>”<U+4EEC><U+5982><U+679C><U+771F><U+7684><U+7231><U+62A4><U+82F9><U+679C>,<U+5C31><U+4E0D><U+5E94><U+7092><U+4F5C><U+82F9><U+679C>“<U+53D7><U+8FEB><U+5BB3>”<U+7684><U+60B2><U+60C5>,<U+800C><U+5E94><U+8FD8><U+4E8B><U+60C5><U+4EE5><U+672C><U+6765><U+7684><U+7B80><U+5355><U+3002><U+679C><U+771F><U+7684><U+5C06><U+5BF9><U+6297><U+6FC0><U+5316>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+663E><U+7136><U+8D62><U+4E0D><U+4E86>,<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5F97><U+5230><U+7684><U+4E5F><U+672A><U+5FC5><U+5C31><U+662F><U+6B63><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F46><U+7531><U+4E8E><U+82F9><U+679C><U+4EA7><U+54C1><U+7684><U+53EF><U+66FF><U+4EE3><U+6027><U+8D8A><U+6765><U+8D8A><U+5927>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8><U+7684><U+4E22><U+5206><U+5C06><U+662F><U+6700><U+591A><U+7684><U+3002><U+73B0><U+5728><U+8BB8><U+591A><U+4E8B><U+60C5><U+5728><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+65F6><U+5E38><U+88AB><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+5316>,<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5185><U+90E8><U+7684><U+4EF7><U+503C><U+89C2><U+5206><U+5316><U+5E38><U+628A><U+5C0F><U+4E8B><U+641E><U+6210><U+5927><U+4E8B>,<U+5BFC><U+81F4><U+5BF9><U+7ACB><U+4E1B><U+751F><U+3002><U+8FD9><U+662F><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+81EA><U+5DF1><U+7684><U+95EE><U+9898><U+3002><U+5916><U+56FD><U+5546><U+4E1A><U+516C><U+53F8><U+5E94><U+79BB><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5F53><U+4E0B><U+7279><U+6B8A><U+7684>“<U+653F><U+6CBB><U+70ED><U+60C5>”<U+5C3D><U+53EF><U+80FD><U+8FDC><U+4E00><U+70B9>,<U+522B><U+5F80><U+91CC><U+6405><U+548C><U+3002>How Apple's return policy in China differs from the U.S. - Apple 2.0 -Fortune Tech UPDATE: Several readers have pointed out that European Union consumer laws require Apple to honor claims of defective hardware for 2 years from date of delivery (See the UK for an English language version).

Have any independent experts confirmed that Apple is or is not conforming to current laws/regulations about after-sales support policies for computer/electronic devices?// Official China Daily Fires at Apple over Warranty Complaints -Caijing “Apple offers a global warranty period of 1 year - that's the same whichever country you are in.” wrote China Daily in an article. ”But Chinese law states that warranties on computer sales must be at least two years.” The paper also cited a Chinese lawyer as saying that foreign companies in China should obey Chinese laws and Apple’s warranty clauses apparently violate the nation’s law. Apple changed some of its warranty clauses under amounting pressure but the move was called by Chinese lawyers as putting “old wine in new bottles”. One of the former repair terms “Apple is entitled to retain your product until full payment by you of all charges for the repair,” was replaced with “Apple is entitled to retain your product and provide repair services at relatively-low price.” Chinese consumers demand Apple action over complaints - Xinhua The China Consumer's Association (CCA) has asked Apple Inc. to "sincerely apologize to Chinese consumers" and "thoroughly correct its problems," after the U.S. firm took little action to address waves of criticism. In a statement posted on the CCA's website, Apple Inc. was told to equalize the warranty periods in China compared with other countries. Buyers of iPads, after the company admitted the device is classifiable as a portable computer, are entitled to two-year after-sale service packages for its key components, said the statement.//<U+4EBA><U+6C11><U+65E5><U+62A5>-<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+534F><U+4F1A><U+516C><U+5F00><U+529D><U+8C15><U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8> <U+5C0A><U+91CD><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+5408><U+6CD5><U+6743><U+76CA><U+6539><U+6B63><U+5B58><U+5728><U+95EE><U+9898> People's Daily page 4 Saturday on China Consumer Association saying what Apple needs to changeChina resolutely opposes U.S. curbs on IT imports: state media | Reuters State media including Xinhua, the China Daily and the People's Daily, quoted a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce as saying the U.S. bill "sends a very wrong signal".

Single adults with a permanent Beijing residence registration, who have not made purchases in the city before, are allowed to buy only one apartment, according to the announcement. Shanghai said banks will be banned from giving loans to local residents who are buying a third apartment or more, according to a government announcement. Meanwhile, the two cities will raise down payments for second-home buyers. The two mega-cities both vow to strictly implement the 20-percent tax on capital gains from property sales. Beijing said the tax will be exempt if the property is the seller's only one and they have owned it for five years or more. The Shanghai announcement did not mention similar policy.// Beijing Bans One-Person Households From Buying Second Homes - Bloomberg The city of Beijing banned single- person households from buying more than one residence and increased the minimum down-payment for all buyers of second homes as the government seeks to cool the property market. The new measures take effect tomorrow, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, which said the city will also enforce a 20 percent tax on capital gains from property. Current rules allow each household with a Beijing residence permit to buy a second home, opening the way for couples to divorce on paper to double their ability to invest.Govt pledges unified real estate registry - Frontpage - CHINA - Globaltimes.cn The central government's vow to launch and implement a unified real estate registration system by the end of June 2014 is expected to bring down property prices and pave the way for the introduction of a property tax, said market insiders Friday. The target was laid out Thursday in a document of the State Council's tasks for institutional reform and transforming functions in the next five years, which also laid out deadlines for completing the tasks and the responsible departments. According to the document posted on the official website of the central government, 29 tasks are expected to be completed this year, 28 in 2014, 11 in 2015, and four in 2017. An opinion piece on the website of the Xinhua News Agency Friday said the deadlines revealed by the State Council highlighted the authorities' will to accelerate the pace of building a service-oriented government.Xi Jinping goes to Russia--Sinica Podcast Xi Jinping's trip to Moscow earlier this week, his first journey abroad as China's new head of state, has raised interesting questions about China's ambitions in Asia, and coupled with Washington's "pivot to Asia" is resurrecting the specter of a strategic standoff between southern and northern Asia around the world's two leading superpowers.
