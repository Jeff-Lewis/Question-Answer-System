The results of the eurozone's stress tests released on Sunday are pretty bullish. Most of the 130 banks reviewed were relatively healthy, based on the European Central Bank's assessment. Twenty-five banks had a capital shortfall prior to the end of December, when the assessment concluded, but only 13 still need to raise money. Those banks have to come up with a total of €9.5 billion ($12.9 billion), which is basically peanuts in terms of the whole system: The 130 banks in assessment account for €22 trillion ($27.9 trillion) in assets. But there is one colossal elephant in the room that the ECB's comprehensive assessment did not look at — that's because it is out of its hands.  Here's the real problem with the major European banks, in one graph: High Frequency Economics It is easy to see the issue: Banks are not lending enough.  But if very few of the eurozone banks are distressed, and the so-called problem ones need to raise only a small of amount capital to be in good shape, then shouldn't those lending figures bounce back pretty soon? This all leads us to the real issue, which does not have to do with the banking system but with demand for credit.  Here's what analysts had to say Monday morning: Raj Badiani at IHS Global Insight sums it up nicely: “The economy remains enveloped by downturn characteristics, choking of the demand for credit." The eurozone's banks are undoubtedly damaged, and the continent would benefit from a more unified financial system. But consumer confidence, household spending, business investment, and most other measures of economic health have struggled to return to pre-crisis levels in the eurozone, even six years after the financial crisis. Oxford Economics Making sure the eurozone's financial system is in better order than it has been — and more suited to a monetary union — are worthy goals. But it's a mistake to pretend it's going to solve a problem that is beyond the remit of financial regulators.   FREE AppDownload
