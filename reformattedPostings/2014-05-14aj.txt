Cisco CEO John ChambersCisco just reported its quarterly earnings. It reported Q3 revenue of $11.5 billion and Q3 earnings per share of 51 cents non-GAAP, and 42 cents EPS GAAP. Analysts were expecting 48 cents EPS on revenue of about $11.4 billion. That represented a nearly 7% decline in revenue over the year-ago quarter.  So that's a beat. Investors are happy. The stock is up about over 6% in after-hours trading, to about $24.34. CEO John Chambers warned investors in February that sales for this quarter would come in 6-8% below the year-ago quarter. Chambers likes to warn of a worst-case and then beat that warning. Cisco's guidance for next quarter is revenue of $11.36 billion, non-GAAP EPS of 48 cents. Analysts were looking for guidance of 51 cents EPS on $11.7 billion for the next quarter or another 5% dip in revenue year-over-year, too. The full press release can be found here. FREE AppDownload
