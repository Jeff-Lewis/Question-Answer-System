Wikimedia CommonsThe short-tailed albatross.Deutsche Bank Chief US Economist Joe LaVorgna is not convinced the U.S. economy is about to take off. In his latest note, LaVorgna says near-term growth prospects for America look pretty bearish, and cites two reasons why: Congress, and Congress: One, we are still getting some fiscal drag this year; and two, there are still big budget battles that need to be fought; this, in turn, could further depress business confidence with negative implications for spending and hiring. He does some math to make his case: the expiration of the payroll tax credit will create a -0.75 point gash in GDP growth. And the new, higher tax rates on marginal income, dividends and capital gains will create an additional drag of up to -0.25 points. Thus, "we are likely to get at least a one percentage point drag on 2013 real GDP," he writes. What's more, if Congress allows spending cuts (aka sequestration) to move forward in two months, the hole could grow even larger.  LaVorgna tries to end on an upbeat note, but can't quite go all the way: "The economy has made tremendous headway—we note private sector balance sheets are in excellent shape and the housing market is in a meaningful recovery; but growth prospects would be significantly better if fiscal policy were on the right track."
