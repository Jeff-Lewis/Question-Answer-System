Recently we posted a set of Uzi pictures that a reader sent us. The reader bought the weapon at a gun show, and as far as we know followed all state and federal laws. The response from other readers was explosive. At least one commenter claimed he was writing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to complain.  Well, we have now heard from the gun-buyer again. He says his IP address is now blocked from visiting gun and ammunition websites from his phone and home computers.  He has had no visits by law enforcement. But he thinks the government has found him and is now blocking him. The government does not centrally control the Internet, so this seems unlikely. But assuming the reader remains unable to access weapons sites, it will be interesting to figure out what is really going on. Most likely, if anyone is "blocking" the reader, it's his Internet Service Provider. (But even that would raise some interesting questions ... ) Here's a screenshot from his phone.  Robert Johnson FREE AppDownload
