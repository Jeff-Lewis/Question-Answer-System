APMcDonald's October same-store sales topped analysts expectations as declines slowed in the US. Global sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.5%, the company reported Monday. Analysts had expected a 2.2% drop. In the US, same-store sales declined 1.1%, which was an improvement from September's 4.1% decrease. The better-than-expected results are likely due to a boost from McDonald's monopoly promotion, which the company brought back at the beginning of last month.  "Today's consumers increasingly prefer customizable food options, dining in a contemporary, inviting atmosphere, and using more convenient ways to order and pay for their meals," McDonald's president and CEO Don Thompson said in a statement. "Although October results reflect our current business challenges, we are moving with a sense of urgency to improve the trajectory of our financial performance while taking the actions necessary to pursue the brand's long-term potential." Global comparable sales fell 0.7% in Europe for the month and 4.2% in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa region. The company recorded a 3.3% drop in global same-store sales in the third quarter. FREE AppDownload
