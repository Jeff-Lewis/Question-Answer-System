REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Markit Economics says US PMI fell to 51.9 in June. Consensus was for 52.3.  Prior was 52.2. For Q2 as a whole the reading was 52.1, the lowest reading since Q3 2012. “Manufacturing clearly down-shifted a gear between the first and second quarters, and is at risk of losing further momentum as we head into the second half of the year," Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
