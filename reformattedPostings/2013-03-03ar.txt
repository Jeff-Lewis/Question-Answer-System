NBC"Meet the Press" host David Gregory challenged House Speaker John Boehner over one of Boehner's major talking points on the sequester — that President Barack Obama does not have a plan to replace the forced spending cuts that began kicking in Friday. Boehner made the claim and Gregory immediately pushed back, noting that Obama has put forward a plan that is on the White House's website. Here's the exchange: BOEHNER: Now listen, we've known about this for 16 months. And yet even today, there's no plan from Senate Democrats or the White House to replace the sequester. And over the last 10 months, House Republicans have acted twice to replace the sequester. There are smarter ways to cut spending than these automatic across the board...DAVID GREGORY:GREGORY: But Mr. Speaker, that's just not true. They've made it very clear, as the President just did, that he has a plan that he's put forward that involves entitlement cuts, that involves spending cuts, that you've made a choice as have Republicans to leave tax loopholes in place. And you'd rather have those and live with all these arbitrary cuts...BOEHNER: Well, David that's just nonsense. If he had a plan, why wouldn't Senate Democrats go ahead and pass it? The House has acted twice over the last ten months to replace the sequester. If we’re going to — the president got his tax hikes on January the first. If we're going to get rid of loopholes, let's lower rates and make the tax code fair for all Americans. The Senate failed to pass both Republican and Democratic-led bills that would have replaced the sequester's $85 billion worth of cuts this year. The two bills the House passed to avoid the cuts are now defunct, because they expired with the end of the last Congress.
