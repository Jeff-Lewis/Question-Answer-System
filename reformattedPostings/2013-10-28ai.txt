Revenue, EPS, and iPhone sales are ahead of expectations. iPad sales were a little worse than expected, but not too bad.  The stock initially tanked after the numbers were out thanks to weaker than expected margin guidance. Apple guided to 36.5%-37.5%, which suggests a flat margin despite a new iPhone.  On the company's earnings call, it explained why margin was lighter than expected and the stock came roaring back. At last check it was down slightly in after hours trading.  Apple's margin will be hit by a combination of factors. It is selling new iPads that cost more to make, new laptops, foreign exchange issues, and most importantly, a $900 million sequential increase in deferred revenue thanks to all the software it is giving away with iOS and Macs.  On the earnings call, Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray said the real margin would have been closer to 38.5%, and Apple basically confirmed it. This sent the stock climbing.  Here are the big numbers from the report: Other numbers: Highlights from the earnings call: Here's a chart of iPhone sales: BII Here's a chart of iPad sales: BII Here's a chart of iPhone average selling prices: Business Insider IntelligenceHere's a chart of iPad average selling prices: BIIAnd, here's a chart of where Apple's revenue comes from: BIILIVE NOTES FROM THE CALL Thank Apple employees taking us this far...
