via Foursquare/Dylan L.This is by far the best line in the Wall Street Journal's latest article on Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors...  In an effort to boost morale, Mr. Cohen arranged in July for a local "Super Duper Weenie" hot-dog truck to swing by SAC's office and dispense free food. SAC was indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal insider trading charges in late July.  The fund has been hit with a slew of redemptions this year.
