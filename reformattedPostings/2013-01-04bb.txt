Home RestaurantThe West Village is known for its trendy restaurants, charming cafes, and incredible specialty food shops. In our opinion, it's the best neighborhood for food in Manhattan. (Disclosure: we are both West Village residents who might be a bit biased. But still.) Though there are no definitive boundaries, the West Village is loosely defined as the area that's bounded by 14th Street (to the north), Houston Street (to the south), 6th Avenue (to the east), and the Hudson River (to the west). From the best burger joints to the best fine dining restaurants, these are our favorite eateries in the West Village. FREE AppDownload
