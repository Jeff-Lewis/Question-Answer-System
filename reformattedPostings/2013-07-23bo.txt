The bank tweeted out this "fact sheet" on its role in physical commodities markets about half an hour ago. Also this morning, the Senate Banking Committee is listening to testimony from four experts about Wall Street's role in commodities markets. The Federal Reserve is to decide whether or not to continue a 2003 rule that allows Wall Street banks to purchase physical commodities in September, and if it's axed, the banks stand to lose a lot of business. The witnesses, for the most part, are falling on the side that the Fed needs to end the rule. We'll let you know if there are any fireworks. In the meantime, here's Goldman's fact sheet: As part of our activities as a market maker, or intermediary between buyers or sellers, in commodities and commodity futures and derivatives, Goldman Sachs, like a number of other financial institutions, holds physical commodities in inventory.    We also hold other physical commodity operations as investments. This includes Metro International Trade Services, a metal warehousing company we bought in 2010, and which operates under the regulations of the London Metals Exchange (LME).  Recent news reports have inaccurately accused Metro of deliberately creating aluminum shortages and incorrectly asserted that Metro moves aluminum from one warehouse to another in order to earn more rent fees.
