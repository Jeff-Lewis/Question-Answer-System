Sotheby's International RealtyMoney manager Barrie Zesiger is selling his private island estate in Norwalk, Connecticut for $12.9 million — a home he and his wife have shared for 26 years (h/t WSJ). The house basically sounds like the life. Zesiger and his wife have a money managing firm in Manhattan, but from Thursday to Monday they sail from their island to the city and then take a train to work. Another huge plus: Since the property is so close to the mainland, its utilities are all underwater and the house went virtually unscathed during Super Storm Sandy. A part of their floating dock ended up in the front yard, but the Zesiger's considering building a helipad on the island, so that may not be an issue for the next owner anyway. The 3.5 acre estate boasts a 6 bedroom 4 bathroom (with 3 half bathrooms) main house. There's also a 2 bedroom caretaker's cottage, 1 bed room boathouse, a tea house, and an in-ground pool. Doug Werner of Sotheby's International Realty has the listing.
