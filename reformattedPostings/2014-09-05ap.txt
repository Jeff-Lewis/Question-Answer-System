REUTERS/Toby MelvilleHere's Elizabeth Hurley kissing someone else.Married banker Julian Bharti, 27, shelled out $81,000 to plant a kiss on model/actress Elizabeth Hurley, PageSix reports. It was for a good cause. Bharti made the sizeable donation to the Elton John AIDS Foundation at an auction on Thursday evening so he could kiss the 49-year-old bombshell.  Bharti is the founder of Delano Capital, a firm that provides capital raising and advisory services to companies in the natural resources sector. He's also managing director at Forbes &amp; Manhattan — a merchant bank founded by multimillionaire mining financier Stan Bharti. The young banker is married. His wife didn't mind, the report said.  FREE AppDownload
