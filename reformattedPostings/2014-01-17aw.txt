APAs stock indices go, the Dow is weird and people tend to hate it. That's because it's a price-weighted index, so a stock with a high per-share price will move the index around more. In fact, a one-point move in any single Dow stock moves the whole index by 6.4219 points. Right now, the Dow is up about 60 points (0.4%). And that's entirely due to two credit card companies, Visa and American Express. American Express is ripping just under 5% today after posting solid earnings, accounting for 26.5 points of the Dow's rise. Visa is only up 2%, but it's adding 30 points to the Dow.Together, Visa and American Express are responsible for 94% of the entire index's rise. Again, the Dow is weird and people tend to hate it. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is basically flat today. Go figure. FREE AppDownload
