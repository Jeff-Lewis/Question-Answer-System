Gold is really getting whooped these days. It was recently around $1400 again, and all the gold bulls thought the good ol' days were back. But it got shellacked yesterday, and it's lower again too. It was down even more earlier in the day — perhaps on the report that Obama will nominate Larry Summers to Fed Chair as soon as late next week and the perception that Summers is more hawkish than Yellen. Still it's lower than yesterday, and headed down. Kitco FREE AppDownload
