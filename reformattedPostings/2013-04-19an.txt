CNNBoston officials are holding a press conference to provide updates on the manhunt in Boston, which is now focused on 19-year-old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev. Col. Timothy Alben of the Massachusetts State Police said that police have not apprehended any suspects, but he added "we will have one." Alben said that the suspect fled on foot.  "We are committed to seeing a conclusion to this case," Alben said. The suspect is likely still in Massachusetts, Alben said. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said that the investigation was effectively at the same point as "Monday night" or "Tuesday morning." "We are where we were effectively as of Monday night [or] Tuesday morning, with a couple of exceptions," Patrick said. Patrick lifted the "stay indoors" request and announced that public transit is running again. But he urged everyone to remain vigilant. FREE AppDownload
