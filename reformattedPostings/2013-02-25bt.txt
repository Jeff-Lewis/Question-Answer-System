Niccolo Caranti Rome, Italy — However things turn out in this crucial Italian election, this has been a HUGE day for Beppe Grillo, the populist comedian who built an anti-bank, anti-elite political movement basically via his blog. He represents a protest movement that's furious with the bad economy, and the elites from Brussels imposing austerity, while unemployment surges. All around the country, his merry band of troublemakers -- known as the 5 Star Movement -- is having a major impact, garnering between 15 and 30% of the vote in key regions. Check out the results in Sicily, where he's running ahead of the main leftist candidate, Bersani. Via @Fgoria: Fabrizio Goria FREE AppDownload
