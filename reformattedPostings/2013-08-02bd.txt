Reuters/Aly SongIf you visit Tianducheng, a day trip from Shanghai in China's Zhejiang province, you will be confronted by a 354-foot replica of the Eiffel tower. Development on this Paris replica in China began in 2007, but local media say it is a ghost town now. Everyone points to China's ghost towns as proof of a malaise in China's property sector.  But some, like Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia have argued that these cities will become "thriving metropolitan areas" as China continues to urbanize. What's truly quirky about these ghost towns though is that some of them have been designed as replicas of Italian, German, English, and French towns. We drew on photos from Reuters photographer Aly Song to give you a peek at Tianducheng.
