REUTERS/Larry Downing President Barack Obama is proposing new tax credits and job-training programs for workers in his fiscal-year 2015 budget released Tuesday while calling for the tax hike on wealthy Americans known as the "Buffett rule," the elimination of one of Wall Street's favorite tax loopholes, and long-term deficit reduction. Though not all elements of the president's budget will be accepted, it will doubtlessly set the stage for the 2014 mid-term elections.  Obama will discuss his budget plan Tuesday morning from Powell Elementary School in Washington, D.C.
