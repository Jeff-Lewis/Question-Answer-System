REUTERS/Rick WilkingOn Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve announced it would taper its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds, a stimulus program intended to keep rates low and lending activity up. As expected, interest rates rose, with 30-year mortgage rates climbing 3.4% to about 4.5%. But despite the rising cost of home ownership, homebuilder stocks have been among the best performers during this period, according to Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker. That's because there was apparently enough momentum in the housing market to allow the housing market to power through any headwind rising rates may have caused.
