Thirty-one year-old penny stock trader Timothy Sykes spoofed Ben Affleck's famous speech from "Boiler Room" in a YouTube video promoting his trading education company. Here's Sykes' version: "I'm a millionaire.  It's weird, right? I'll tell ya, it's a weird thing to say. I'm a f------g millionaire!...I made my first million when I was 22. You think I was just lucky? No, I was driven to become a millionaire. I became very f-----g good at trading and I've made several million dollars since.... Anyone who tells you that money is the root of all evil doesn't f------g have any. People say 'Money can't buy happiness', look at the smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby. You want details? I drive a brand new Lamborghini Gallardo. I live in a ridiculous seven-bedroom house in Miami Beach. I travel all over the world with the most beautiful women. I have every single toy you could possibly imagine. Best of all, I'm a trader, not an investor, so I'm liquid. All cash." Sykes, who claims that he has a 70% winning percentage, says that his students will become consistently profitable traders within one year. "If you want average returns, go watch Jim Cramer on CNBC," he says. Watch below:   FREE AppDownload
