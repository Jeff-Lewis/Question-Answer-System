Sydney’s median asking price for freestanding houses passed the $1 million mark for the first time, according to data released by SQM Research, an investment research house. Houses, including terraces but excluding townhouses, hit a median asking price of $1,005,800 this month, as this chart shows: SQM Research Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, says that right now it would be impossible to purchase a freestanding house in Sydney’s inner ring for under $1 million and “will become increasingly difficult” to do so in Sydney’s middle ring. The next highest average asking price is in Perth at $765,000. The Australian capital city average asking price is $755,100 and the national average is $486,600. Official statistics are showing a slowdown in the growth of prices nationally but Sydney’s housing market is still hot with a 14.6% rise for the 12 months to the end of September.
