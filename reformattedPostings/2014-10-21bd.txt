The New York Federal Reserve has had it with Wall Street's behavior, and in a closed-door meeting with industry executives on Monday, it handed down an ultimatum. Change your behavior, or we'll have to downsize you. "The inevitable conclusion will be reached that your firms are too big and complex to manage effectively," New York Fed president William Dudley said. "In that case, financial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so they can be managed effectively." The problem, Dudley said, is cultural. The $6 billion trading losses, the violations of international money laundering sanctions, the scandals in which traders shave a little off the top, those are not the actions of a few rogue traders — they are the representation of a corrupted whole. So how do you change a culture? One solution is that you start by changing what matters: compensation. Wall Street has already started doing this by deferring more compensation and tying it to long-term performance. But it hasn't been enough. According to The Wall Street Journal, Dudley went on to say that senior management needed to take more responsibility. He suggested creating some kind of performance bond that would further tie executive compensation to performance or legal issues. He also suggested creating a database that tracks any ethical issues lower-level employees have had. Lets see if this has legs. FREE AppDownload
