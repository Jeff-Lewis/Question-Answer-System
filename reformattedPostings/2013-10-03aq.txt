As we enter October and the final quarter of the year, I thought it would be fun to highlight October stock market performance through some memorable market snapshots. It’s almost a right of passage for active investors to “tour” the hallowed halls of October and feel its rich history of market volatility. Despite the stock market crashes of 1929 and 1987, October stock market performance has been historically positive. So, although we have seen great volatility and memorable market crashes (and rallies), the month has been on par with other months.  That said, it’s been a mad house for active investors, making or breaking many traders’ years. From the 1987 Stock Market Crash to the 1997 Asian Contagion to the 2002 Tech Bottom to the 2008 Stock Market Crash and more, it’s been a month of wild market swings.
