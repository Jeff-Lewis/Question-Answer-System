In that article I laid out the beginning matrix for evaluating the performance of nations using a broad set of criteria that would monitor progress toward the primary objectives associated with my new discipline called Globalnomics. For those of you who were not fortunate enough to have read that earlier article, in it I listed a preliminary set of eight performance criteria that could be used to set the foundation for the PERC National Performance Evaluation Review.  The measureable weighting system regarding the preliminary set of criteria that I proposed for monitoring the world’s nations and building a set of globalnomic baseline statistics were as follows: The process of gathering national information relating to the above criteria has just begun.  There is a wealth of information from excellent and reliable world sources regarding all of the above criteria that can be checked and cross-checked for evaluation purposes.  But since the Food/Water criteria heads the top of my list, I thought it would be worthwhile sharing just a small sample of what my team of analysts has begun to uncover. The primary source information and the national summaries that follow come from the 2012 International Programs (IP/CALS) at Cornell University and Homeland Productions.  Other solid cross-checking sources exist that confirm the general information that I am about to share.  Since there is so much talk about the declining position of the United States especially in relation to the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), I thought it worthwhile to share an “early” look at how the United States and the BRIC nations might fair in the evaluation of what is considered the most important of my globalnomic categories:  Food and Water.  The following table provides that early look. Food/Water (Globalnomics) U.S. BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA CHINA Population (in millions) 309 194 142 1171 1338 Population Growth 0.7% 0.9% -0.1% 1.3% 0.5% Hunger Index Industrial Low Low Alarming Moderate Undernourishment &lt;=   5% 6% &lt;-   5% 19% 10% Food Consumption (cal/day)         3,748          3,113          3,376          2,352          2,981  Cereal Crop Yield (kg/ha)         7,238          3,113          3,376          2,352          2,981  Arable Land (ha/person) 0.53 0.32           0.86  0.14 0.08 Water Resources (m3/person)         9,179        29,037        30,405          1,252          2,113  Farm Employment 1.5% 17.4% 8.6% no   data 39.6% Income Spent on Food 6.4% 24.7% 29.7% 29.5% 23.0% Obesity Percent 33.9% 11.1% no   data no   data 2.9%             Cereal Crop per Person (kg/person)         3,836             996          2,903             329             238      Humor me, please, and take a another second longer look at the above table and consider how the five nations above compare.  Look at the Hunger Index.  Look at Food Consumption by person.  Look at the Cereal Crop Yield and the Arable Land that each nation has.  Look at the Water resources of the different nations.  Look at the amount of income that the nations spend on food.  And yes, also take a look at Obesity rates.  The last item, the Cereal Crop per Person, might be the most telling and is essentially just the multiplication of two of the earlier factors. Now that you have given some thought to the above, I would like to share with you the national summaries that were provided by the source mentioned above. United States of America: World’s biggest economy and leading exporter of wheat, corn, beef, and many other commodities.  Most unequal wealth distribution of all major developed countries.  Economic woes have led one in seven Americans to rely on food assistance.  Rapid changes in diet causing serious health problems, especially among poor.  Three fourths of Americans overweight, more than one-third obese, and more than 8% diabetic.  Brazil: World’s largest cattle producer and top exporter of coffee, chickens, sugarcane, tropical fruit; second largest exporter of soy, mainly to China.  Rapidly declining poverty, inequality, and malnutrition.  Large agribusiness sector, but most farms subsistence level.  Many landless.  Lacks infrastructure, especially in rural area.  Among the most bio-diverse countries in the word, contains large portion of Amazon basin. Russia: World’s wheat prices doubled when largest country in world and fifth leading wheat exporter banned exports during 2010 drought.  More than half of farmland output comes from household plots.  Unlikely to become world’s breadbasket with climate change.  Scientists predict gains in some areas and losses in others.  Official food security policy calls for 80% of basic foodstuffs to be domestically produced by 2020. India: Despite dramatic economic growth, world’s second most populous country remains home to more hungry people than any other nation.  Rising incomes with persistent malnutrition known as India enigma.  More than half of labor force works in agriculture but productivity is low.  Population strains all social and environmental systems.  Concerns include water shortages, soil erosion, salinization, desertification, drought, season flooding, and air and water pollution.  Long term challenges include infrastructure, education, and growing demand for meat and dairy. China:  Contains one-fifth of world’s population and one-tenth of its arable land.  Extremely rapid economic growth primarily concentrated in urban areas.  Trending towards less poverty and malnutrition but increasingly challenged to produce sufficient food.  Outsourcing cereal and soy production to Africa and South America.  Facing serious water shortages in highly populated northern plain, traditionally the country’s breadbasket.  Increasing numbers of livestock straining fragile pasture land. And now to wrap up this early preliminary national review of the most highly valued category within Globalnomics, Food and Water, the following table offers an opportunity to see how a few other nations (e.g.,  Japan, Iran, Egypt, The Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ethiopia) stack up against the United States and the BRIC nations.   Eat and drink well, my friends.
