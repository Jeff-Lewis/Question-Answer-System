In his memoir, "Yes, Chef," Marcus Samuelsson recounts the journey from his humble roots in Ethiopia to the highly competitive kitchens in Sweden and New York where he honed his craft. He sees the world through the lens of food, because it's what helps him feel most at home.  Samuelsson admits, however, that family life is harder to figure out. He wrote candidly about missing the funerals of his beloved grandmother and father, and only belatedly starting to take care of a child he fathered at a young age. In this video, Samuelsson says that finding the right work-life balance continues to present him with his biggest challenge.
