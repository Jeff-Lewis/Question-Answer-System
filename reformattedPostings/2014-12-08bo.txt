You can avoid annoying headphone knots entirely with AViiQ's tangle-free earphones. Their flat-cable design ensures that unlike their rounded counterparts, they'll generate less friction and be less aerodynamic, which decreases the possibility of a tangle. These headphones also have up to 20 decibels of noise isolation and a built-in microphone and remote. They work with any phone or tablet, so no need to fret about compatibility.  You can grab it here with a discount thanks to Insider Picks and our friends at Stack Commerce.
