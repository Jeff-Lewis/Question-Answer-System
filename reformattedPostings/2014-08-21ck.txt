A cargo ship run by Danish shipping and oil conglomerate AP Moeller Maersk has set the world record by hauling 17,603 containers, World Maritime news reports. The Maersk Triple-E, the world's largest ship, set the mark on July 21 when it left Algeciras, Spain, on its way to Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia. The Triple-E has a full potential capacity of 18,270 20-foot equivalent units (TEU).  Maersk raised its full-year profit guidance on Tuesday after quarterly results boosted by its robust container shipping business.
