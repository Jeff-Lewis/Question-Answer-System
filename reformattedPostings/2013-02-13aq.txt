Business school isn't just about getting an MBA. It's about meeting people who can propel your career forward. After all, who you know is often just as important as what you know. GraduatePrograms.com, a non-profit that surveys graduate students and provides scholarships to a random selection of students who participate, recently put together a ranking of the MBA programs that have the best social life. They defined social life as "accessibility to the social scene (meeting and making friends and/or dating)."   The rankings are entirely based on 4,500 surveys of current and recently graduated students conducted from September 1, 2012 to January 7, 2013. They were asked to rank their schools on a ten star system (one being the lowest score, and ten the highest) for a variety of different categories.  Here are the top ten schools for social life:  FREE AppDownload
