BloombergDavid KostinThe bull market in the U.S. stock market recently completed its fifth year. Since March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 gained 1,200 points or 180%. "Three drivers of the rally: A profit rebound (59% of rally), a P/E multiple expansion (25%), and a change in expected EPS growth (16%)," noted Goldman Sachs' David Kostin. Now, everyone want to know if this rally can continue. "In order for S&amp;P 500 to climb higher, (a) the level of profits, (b) the expected forward earnings growth rate, and/or (c) the P/E multiple must change," said Kostin. "Given the high starting point of all three metrics, it is hard to identify any one of these that will climb significantly during the coming year." Kostin discussed each of these three drivers. We paraphrase here: So, there's not much enthusiasm here. Kostin has a 1,900 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500, which reflects a modest 3% gain from current levels. FREE AppDownload
