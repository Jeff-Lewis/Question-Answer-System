KPCBFormer analyst and current Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker is best known for her presentations on the state of the Web. But over the past couple years, she has expanded her interests beyond tech companies to look at more macro issues. Today, at the D Conference, Meeker gave a presentation on a hot button issue in the tech industry: immigration.
