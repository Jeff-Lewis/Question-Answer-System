NOTE: Originally, the UNODC website said the price of a gram of marijuana in Lichtenstein was around $1,020. This has since been corrected to a price of about nine Swiss Francs per gram, or about $10.13. With legalization efforts in the United States becoming ever more popular, the world marijuana market is evolving. We were curious about the current state of marijuana prices around the world. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's 2013 World Drug Report, which was referenced in a new Tablet piece, marijuana prices are extremely low in Africa and South America — in most of these countries, marijuana is less than a dollar per gram. Pricey locales include Bermuda at $124 per gram, the United Arab Emirates at $110, Brunei at $80, and Japan at $75. The United States has a wide range of prices, varying from about 25¢ per gram (or $7 per ounce) to $63.50 per gram ($1800 per ounce). We made the following map using retail price data from the UN's report.
