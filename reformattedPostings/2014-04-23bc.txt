MarkitMarkit's preliminary U.S. manufacturing PMI survey is out. The headline index slipped to 55.4 in April from 55.5 in March. Economists had estimated the number would climb to 56.0. Any reading above 50 signals growth, which means the numbers are still strong. "Overall this report is consistent with our view that manufacturing activity will pick up throughout 2014," said Barclays Cooper Howes. Here are the key points via Markit: "Manufacturers reported a solid start to the second quarter, with output growing at its fastest pace for over three years," noted Markit's Chris Williamson. "With manufacturing acting as a good bellwether of the rest of the economy, the survey bodes well for further robust economic growth in the second quarter. “Companies are taking on staff to build operating capacity in the face of an increasingly favourable outlook. The April survey recorded ongoing job creation in the region of 10-15k per month in the goods producing sector."   Markit FREE AppDownload
