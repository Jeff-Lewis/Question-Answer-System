At least some of the selling can be attributed to the significant overseas exposure of the publicly traded US companies. Last week's stock market sell-off put the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the red for the year. This week comes with some telling economic reports from the US and abroad. We'll also be hearing from more Fed officials including Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who'll speak on Friday at 8:30 a.m. in Boston. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Wall Street's equity strategists are split about the current volatility in the markets. Those like Fundstrat's Tom Lee who focus on fundamentals think this is just a blip in an ongoing bull market. But chartists like UBS's Art Cashin and MKM Partners' Jonathan Krinsky warn that the S&amp;P 500 testing its 200-day moving average is a bit ominous. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco notes that sell-offs are pretty typical ahead of mid-term elections, and we've got one coming up on November 4. Here's Bianco: "On average, the S&amp;P suffered a 12% decline in the 6 months leading to the election and then rallied 25% trough to peak in the 6 months after the election or a 10% gain from prior peak. Elections are important, but performance around past mid-terms was influenced by other factors. The S&amp;P suffered a correction in 7 of the 15 mid-term elections since 1954, all of which were related to recessions (1962, 1974, 1990, 2002) or aggressive Fed tightening (1966, 1978) or foreign strains (1998). Ex these 7, the average S&amp;P sell-off was under 5%." For more insight about the middle market, visit mid-marketpulse.com. FREE AppDownload
