TBIInitial unemployment insurance claims plunged to 297,000, the lowest level since May 2007. This was down from 321,000 a week ago. It was also much lower than the 320,000 expected by economists. "There were no special factors impacting this week's initial claims," noted the Department of Labor. The four-week moving average fell 2,000 to 323,250. "Even a partial reversal next week will not change the favorable trend," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson. Continuing claims fell to 2.667 million from 2.676 million last week. This is the lowest level since December 2007. "In our view, this report reflects a further improvement in the separations side of the labor market, which now stands near pre-recession levels," said Barclays' Cooper Howes.
