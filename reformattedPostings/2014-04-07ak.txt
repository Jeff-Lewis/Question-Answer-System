APWorld Wrestling Entertainment announced that last night's WrestleMania 30 broke all kinds of records as it sold out the Superdome in New Orleans and became the venue's highest-grossing event. Unfortunately, the 75,000 that showed up for WrestleMania wasn't enough to impressive investors. The stock is down by 12% today. The sell-off can be attributed to disappointing digital subscriptions. "WWE today announced that WWE Network has 667,287 subscribers and is well on its way to reaching its goal of 1 million subscribers by the end of 2014 just 42 days after launching in the U.S., making it the fastest-growing digital subscription service," said management. But according to Bloomberg, analysts were expecting subscriptions to be in the neighborhood of 800,000. Even with today's sell-off, the stock is still up 47% since the beginning of the year.
