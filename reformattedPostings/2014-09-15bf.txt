LinkedinWes Calvert, an associate at Starboard Value LP. A 25-year-old worked on the epic presentation on Darden Restaurants — the parent company of Olive Garden, Business Insider has learned.  On Friday, Starboard Value LP, which is run by activist investor Jeff Smith, released a 294-page deep-dive report into Olive Garden's business.  We're told by two people that Wes Calvert, a 25-year-old associate at Starboard Value, played a major role in putting together the presentation. We're also told that a number of senior-level analysts worked on the presentation.  One value investor told us his presentation was "one of the best ever."  The slide-deck, which includes recommendations on how Olive Garden can fix its breadstick strategy and improve its pasta quality by cooking with salt, has been widely discussed on Wall Street. Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal called it a "true masterpiece." We reached out to Calvert and Smith for comment. Neither has responded. Calvert joined Starboard Value in February. He previously worked at Credit Suisse, his LinkedIn profile shows. He graduated from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, in 2012.  **Editor's note: A number of senior level folks at Starboard Value also worked on the presentation.  FREE AppDownload
