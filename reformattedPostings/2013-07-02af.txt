Lululemon's sheer yoga pants scandal is coming back to haunt the retailer again.  A shareholder filed a suit in Manhattan Tuesday accusing the company of "defrauding shareholders by hiding defects in yoga pants whose sheerness led to a costly recall, and concealing talks that led to the sudden departure of its chief executive," according to Reuters.  A separate lawsuit filed in May alleges that Lululemon boosted executive pay just before going public with the recall, Reuters reported.  The retailer had to recall 17% of its pants in March for being too sheer. Last month, CEO Christine Day announced her departure from the company.  Lululemon says the debacle could cost the company $40 million in profits.  The company blamed the defect on a supply chain error.  FREE AppDownload
