Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan's stock, has been working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals to try and buy Allergan in a deal valued at $49 billion. Allergan required shareholders owning 25 percent of its shares to submit paperwork. Pershing Square also sued the company in Delaware to compel it to call the meeting.
