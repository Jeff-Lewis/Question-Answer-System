An airport the size of New York City's JFK collects 4 tons of prohibited items every year. The TSA put some of these items on display as a reminder to passengers to be cognizant of what they're packing in their carry-ons as the holiday travel season approaches. You can check what items are prohibited on the TSA's website. Produced by Alex Kuzoian. Video courtesy of Associated Press. Follow BI Video: On YouTube
