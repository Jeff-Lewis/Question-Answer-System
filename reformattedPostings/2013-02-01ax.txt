Our Daniel Goodman is on the scene at 23rd and Broadway in NYC, where a 36" water pipe that was installed in 1915 has burst, causing a subway shutdown. You can see from the picture what a mess it's causing. For straphangers planning their commute this afternoon, be aware that the N, Q, and R trains are suffering major disruptions. Currently there are no N, Q trains between Dekalb Ave Station and 57 St - 7th Ave Station. And no R train service between Queens Plaza Station and Whitehall Street Station. Officials from the NYC DEP and Fire Department have said no customers lost water as a result of the break, but some people downtown are reporting water disruptions.
