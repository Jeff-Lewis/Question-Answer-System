Stocks have started 2013 on a positive note, closing at a five-year high on Friday. So, are people feeling bullish? Art Cashin, UBS Financial Services Director of Floor Operations, is a tad skeptical. He points to some imbalances during end-of-day trading in this morning's "Cashin's Comments": Some On-Close Support For the “New Money” Thesis – As we have noted repeatedly during this New Year’s rally, several of us old fogeys believe most of the fuel for the move is likely coming from 'new money for the new year.’  We pointed to several supporting factors for that thesis, including the recent anomaly with the TRIN indicator. In Friday evening’s post-mortem, a few members of the FoF opened a discussion of the “on-close” imbalances over the opening three sessions of the year.  On the first day, Wednesday, there was over $1.5 billion to buy on-balance.  On the second day, Thursday, there was $800 million (about half the prior day’s number).  On the third day, Friday, the number was about $400 million, again half the prior day.  The FoF contingent felt that pattern would be consistent with shoveling new money in – a large chunk, followed by half and half again.  It would also be consistent with the old traders adage that calendar money is inserted in a three day process.  That could make this week interesting. When this "new money" evaporates, where will the buying support come from? FREE AppDownload
