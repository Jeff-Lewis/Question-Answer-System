Business InsiderThe hot ticket in Davos this evening is a "taxidermy" party thrown by billionaire entrepreneur Sean Parker, Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff, and Ian Osborne of the London-based communications firm Osborne &amp; Partners. Billed as the "Future Of Philanthropy Nightcap," the party is being held in what was until recently a crappy bar on Davos's main drag. I say "until recently," because earlier this week Sean Parker's team took control of the place and went to work on it. Sean Parker designed all the renovations and picked out the decorations himself. And in 48 hours, the bar has been transformed into a one-of-a-kind "taxidermy" emporium, with stuffed animals and animal heads on many of the walls. There's a wine bar in one corner. And a team of bartenders called "Liquid Chef" juggling drinks (to mix them) behind another expansive bar. John Legend is playing. There are said to be three levels of restricted rooms below the main level that only certain guests have access to. And there is, as you will see, a very eclectic mix of guests. I generally feel about two decades too old to fully appreciate parties like these, but tonight's guests included some folks who were two decades younger and some who were two decades older than me. So I actually felt quite at home. Here are some pictures. Apologies in advance for the lousy quality. I'll post some video tomorrow.
