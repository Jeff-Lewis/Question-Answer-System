LPL Financial The S&amp;P 500 has continued the strongest bull market since WWII despite all the shots fired at the market this year: While it has been impossible to kill so far this year despite all the shots fired at it, this is no mindless and shambling rally. Stocks have deliberately moved past these events that did not stop the still beating heart of economic growth in the United States.
