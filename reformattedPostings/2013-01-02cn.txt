Stallings and Nazer join as portfolio managers and partners in DoubleLine Equity LP, a newly created affiliate of DoubleLine.Stallings and Nazer were previously Group Managing Directors at TCW, the highest title for investment managers at the firm. There they managed $5 billion invested in common stocks in several successful strategies, which were both broadly invested and sector- focused.DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach, who previously served as Chief Investment Officer of TCW and headed that firm’s largest investment group, launched DoubleLine in December 2009 with more than 40 of his former colleagues. Today DoubleLine employs more than 80 people, is majority-owned by its employees and manages more than $53 billion in asset allocation, bond and now stock strategies.“In my 24 years at TCW,” Gundlach said, “I knew well the firm’s many equity groups and styles; Brendt and Husam stood out as the most talented and versatile of those investment teams. During several years of the most treacherous markets in generations, working with me as Chief Investment Officer, they delivered returns of over 40% against a flat result for the S&amp;P 500. Importantly, their investment philosophy and process are consistent with and complement those already in place at DoubleLine. I will continue to explore other complementary partnerships and acquisitions to diversify our business and serve our clients.”DoubleLine Equity is managing portfolios seeded by a DoubleLine affiliate as well as by Stallings and Nazer.

With its entrepreneurial culture, employee ownership and investment acumen, we can think of no better partner than DoubleLine.”Nazer said he and Stallings “will immediately begin building out the dedicated research team that our strategies demand.”“The timing could not be better to launch a new equity investment platform,” Nazer continued. “Equities have been disfavored relative to other asset classes for many years.
