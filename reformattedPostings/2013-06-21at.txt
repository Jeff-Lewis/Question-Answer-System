Earlier this week, bond god Jeff Gundlach made a big call on the 10-year. From Barron's, here's what Gundlach said on CNBC: It seems that everything gets indigestion when bond yields get above 2.20. If bond yields fall, I think its initially positive for stocks…. If you from 2 to 2.50, bond investors can lose 4%, but you lose less if you shorten your duration…. I really do not think you’re going to see 2.50 on the ten-year any time in 2013…. I don’t think we’re going to see bond yields return to 1.38% again. Welp, that did not turn out to be correct.
