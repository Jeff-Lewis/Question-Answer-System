Wikimedia CommonsThe world's wealthiest men had to meet one important guideline to qualify for a new ranking of billionaires: they had to be single.  Wealth intelligence firm Wealth-X analyzed the assets of the wealthiest unmarried men in the world to create this list of the richest bachelors. Wealth-X Research uses a proprietary valuation model to assess all asset holdings, including privately and publicly held businesses and investible assets. Included are tech tycoons, music moguls, and even a Russian oligarch. These bachelors may not all be young, and they may not even be looking for love, but they are eligible.  FREE AppDownload
