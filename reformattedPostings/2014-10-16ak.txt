APFounder and CEO Larry Page Google just released its Q3 earnings, delivering a miss on the bottom line and only a slight beat on the top.  Here are the numbers: Stock is down ~3% after hours. One of the main things investors were paying attention to were paid clicks and cost per click. Paid clicks rose only 17% year-over-year versus estimates of 22%. CPC decreased approximately 2% year-over-year over the third quarter of 2013, but remained constant from last quarter. A decrease in CPC was expected, which is why analysts wanted to see better paid click growth. The 2% decline is actually better than some analysts (predicting ~5%) had hoped for, but the continued decline, coupled with the less-than-expected growth in paid clicks, disappointed investors overall.    Here's Google's chart of its paid clicks year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter: Google One surprise on the earnings call was the announcement that Omid Kordestani — referred to as Google's interim chief business officer since last quarter when Nikesh Arora stepped down — would be staying in his role on a more-permanent basis.  Google sites revenues increased 20% year-over-year, in line with analyst predictions, while network revenues increased 9% year-over-year. Other revenues increased 50% year-over-year — making the "other" category about 11% of the total revenues. Analysts were hoping to see this category to grow above 10% of the total this quarter, with growth driven by the Google Play store, so that's in line with those expectations.  Google doesn't break out specific Google Play revenue, but on the earnings call CFO Patrick Pichette confirmed that Google Play was one of the main drivers of "other" revenue growth, though hardware and its Google For Work offerings saw strong growth as well. (Google rebranded Google Enterprise as Google For Work in early September.)   International revenues remain 58% of Google's total revenues, same as last quarter and up 2% year-over-year. Here's a look at Google's historic revenues: Google Another thing investors expressed concern about on the earnings call was Google's increase in operating and capital expenditures — from $4.58 billion in Q2 to $6.10 billion in the third quarter and from $5.08 billion to $5.99 billion, respectively. On the call, Pichette and Kordestani pointed toward Google's continued investment in data centers and real estate, and highlighted that the third quarter was big for hiring college graduates, especially engineering talent. Google's headcount has risen to 55,030 full-time employees, up significantly from 52,069 last quarter.  Google also stressed the success of two of its other advertising intiatives on the call: its product listing ads (PLAs) and Google Preferred, its way of pairing advertisers with the top YouTube content. Kordestani says Google Preferred has nearly sold out. He also said Google would continue to invest in the success of its home-grown YouTube talent, like Bethany Mota and Michelle Phan.  Here's the whole release (and keep scrolling to see our live-blog of the earnings call underneath): Google Inc. reported consolidated revenues of $16.52 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, an increase of 20% compared to the third quarter of 2013. Google Inc. reports advertising revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs (TAC). In the third quarter of 2014, TAC totaled $3.35 billion, or 23% of advertising revenues. Operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release. On January 29, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lenovo Group Limited providing for the disposition of the Motorola Mobile business. Financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as "Net income (loss) from discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014; and assets and liabilities of Motorola Mobile to be disposed of are presented as "Assets held for sale" and "Liabilities held for sale", respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014. On April 2, 2014, we issued shares of Class C capital stock as a dividend to our stockholders. Except for the number of authorized shares and par value, all references to share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated for all prior periods shown to reflect the stock split, which was effected in the form of a stock dividend.

Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenues - Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2014, our revenues in the third quarter of 2014 would have been $66 million higher. Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter of 2013 through the third quarter of 2014, our revenues in the third quarter of 2014 would have been $106 million lower. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging to GAAP international revenues are included at the end of this release. Paid Clicks - Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our Network members, increased approximately 17% over the third quarter of 2013 and increased approximately 2% over the second quarter of 2014.

TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 23% in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 24% in the third quarter of 2013. The majority of TAC is related to amounts ultimately paid to our Network members, which totaled $2.42 billion in the third quarter of 2014. TAC also includes amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $927 million in the third quarter of 2014.

Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) - In the third quarter of 2014, the total charge related to SBC was $1,255 million compared to $856 million in the third quarter of 2013. We currently estimate SBC charges for grants made to employees prior to September 30, 2014 to be approximately $4.16 billion for 2014. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after September 30, 2014.

Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2014 was $5.36 billion, or 32% of revenues.

Net loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2014 included a pre-tax adjustment of $26 million related to the release of the deferral of certain revenue for the Motorola Mobile segment. Had we presented Motorola Mobile as an operating segment, the Motorola Mobile segment revenue for the third quarter of 2014 would have been $1.69 billion, $26 million lower than what was included in net loss from discontinued operations. Net Income - GAAP consolidated net income in the third quarter of 2014 was $2.81 billion, compared to $2.97 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP consolidated net income was $4.37 billion in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $3.82 billion in the third quarter of 2013.

In the third quarter of 2014, free cash flow was $3.58 billion compared to $2.79 billion in the third quarter of 2013. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release. Cash - As of September 30, 2014, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $62.16 billion, which excludes cash classified as held for sale, compared to $58.72 billion as of December 31, 2013.
