Sotheby's International RealtyWooldon Manor in Southampton.Hedge fund tycoon Scott Bommer has flipped his Southampton estate for more than $80 million just a year after buying it for $75 million, reports The Wall Street Journal's Candace Taylor. Bommer, founder of SAB capital initially listed the expansive property on Lake Agawam for $98 million in March. The historic estate, called Wooldon Manor, previously belonged to shoe tycoon Vince Camuto. It sold as two separate parcels: the 10,000-square-foot home and 2 acres, which were bought by a "New York family" for $50 million, and a 12-acre plot, which went to a developer. The estate — which has a gorgeous pool, pool house, formal gardens, a romantic greenhouse, and tennis court — had been owned by both the Woolworth family and Edmund Lynch, a founding partner of Merrill Lynch.
