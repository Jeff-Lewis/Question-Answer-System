Via Sotheby's HomesThe entrance to Rachel "Bunny" Mellon's former townhouse.A gorgeous townhouse in the middle of New York's Upper East Side has just gone into contract for $41 million, according to the Observer.  Tony and Claire White, the sellers of the townhouse, wanted $46 million for the property, but the asking price eventually fell to $41 million.  Built in 1965, the 11,100-square-foot, 14-room townhouse was designed by Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, the heiress to the Listerine fortune who was married to the banking legend Paul Mellon. She was a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a notable horticulturist who redesigned the White House Rose Garden — needless to say, she had impeccable taste.  Her gorgeous UES townhouse with its own private garden, listed with Sotheby's International Realty, is a testament to that.
