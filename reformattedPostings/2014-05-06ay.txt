Wealthy individuals looking to invest in real estate should check out Tel Aviv, Dublin, and Chicago. Those are three of cities identified on a new list of "rising stars" for real estate investors from real estate developers Candy &amp; Candy, Deutsche Asset &amp; Wealth Management and Savills. The 12 cities on the list are set to "outperform the prime world cities and show strong residential price growth as they become more fully invested" in the next few years, and may offer lower-priced alternatives to "safe haven" cities like London and New York, the report writes.
