And foreclosure inventory decreased to 1.2 million homes as of December 2012, down 19.5 percent on the year, and 4.2 percent on the month. This represents 3 percent of all homes with a mortgage.  “The rate of foreclosures continues to trend down, albeit at a slower rate as we exit 2012,” Anand Nallathambi, president and CEO of CoreLogic, said in a press release. "This trend should continue into 2013 and is another positive signal that the gradual healing process in the housing market is gaining traction."
