Companies like Tesla, Netflix, Twitter, and the biotechs have been getting pummeled lately, causing the NASDAQ to be much more of a laggard than everyone else. This is something we'll be watching again today, to see if this risk aversion creeps elsewhere. Other than that, nothing too much special is happening at the moment. FREE AppDownload
