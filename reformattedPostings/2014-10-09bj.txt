A separate decision by the Paris-based ICSID in 2012 ordered Venezuela state oil company PDVSA pay Exxon $908 million. The parties have agreed there will not be double compensation for the nationalization. The ICSID award said Exxon is willing to make the required reimbursement to PDVSA to avoid "double recovery."
