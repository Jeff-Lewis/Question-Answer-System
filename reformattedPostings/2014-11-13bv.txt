So they're accelerating their forecasts and suggesting the world will "soon be awash with oil," cutting the per-barrel Brent Crude price to just $70 (£44.4) by the end of 2016, four years earlier than they previously anticipated.  Here's the basis of their bullish case:  Though they're forecasting $75 per barrel by the end of 2015 and $70 by the end of 2016, they add: "Given the current negative sentiment in the market, it is clearly possible that $70 could be hit much sooner ... we believe that lower oil prices are here to stay."  FREE AppDownload
