Her last day is April 15, according to a brief statement released by the company. She's been overseeing product at the yoga company since 2008.  The statement didn't say who will replace her.  The company recalled its luon yoga pants last month for being too sheer. The incident was the fourth quality-control issue that Lululemon has had in the past year.  Analysts blame the problems on Lululemon's quick expansion and lack of control over its supply chain.  But the issues come at a time when Lululemon is facing unprecedented competition from other retailers like Gap's Athleta.  While the recent sheer yoga pants recall is the most visible gaffe for Lululemon, longtime customers complained that product quality hasn't been the same in recent years.  But much of the criticism has been focused on CEO Christine Day.  "Day has ruined everything special about Lululemon. The bullet proof quality, the fit, the femininity, the lululemoness of the product," Carolyn Beauchesne, author of the blog Lululemon Addict, wrote last month.  FREE AppDownload
