Dr. Ed's BlogThere are numerous measures of corporate profits. The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), which cover GDP, also include profits data on a pre-tax and after-tax basis. The NIPA data also show profits as reported to the IRS and on a cash flow basis, i.e., from “current production.” Of course, both tend to follow the trend in nominal GDP. Since 1960, profits and GDP have fluctuated around a long-term uptrend line growing at a 7% compounded annual rate. S&amp;P 500 earnings tend to fluctuate between long-term growth uptrend lines of 5% and 7%. That’s especially the case for actual four-quarter trailing earnings on both a reported and operating basis. Forward earnings tends to fluctuate around the 7% trend line. During 2009 and 2010, it rebounded back to this uptrend line following a steep drop in 2008. Since early 2011, it has been tracking the 7% uptrend line closely. In recent weeks, it’s been showing signs of faster growth. As long as the economy continues to grow, forward earnings should continue to provide a good tailwind for the stock market. S&amp;P 500 forward earnings tends to be a good leading indicator of actual operating earnings over the coming year when the economy is growing.
