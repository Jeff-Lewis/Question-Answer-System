Perhaps the better idea is to think long-term. In a new report titled, "The Search for Creative Destruction," the analysts at Goldman Sachs do just that. "We showcase eight secular disruptive themes that we believe possess the potential to command greater attention in the coming years," wrote lead analyst Robert Boroujerdi. "Indeed, these stories through product or business innovation are poised to transform addressable markets or open up entirely new ones, offering growth insulated from the broader macro environment and creating value for their stakeholders, in our view." Goldman's themes cut across all industries from manufacturing to finance to tobacco. We've put together the most important data within each "destroyer," describing what it does and quantifying its growth potential.
