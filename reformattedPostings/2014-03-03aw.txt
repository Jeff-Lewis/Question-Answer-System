REUTERS/Ina Fassbender Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have reached a boiling point. Russia has now invaded the disputed region of Crimea and has issued an ultimatum telling Ukrainian forces to surrender by 12 a.m ET or face military action.

Vladimir Osakovskiy, an economist at BofA Merrill Lynch, writes that direct costs of a war could amount to 3% of GDP. Nomura's Alistair Newton also said that Russia might be "obliged to provide extensive economic support, at least for those parts of Ukraine, which it has pulled firmly into its sphere of influence, which would add to the burden on Russia’s economy."
