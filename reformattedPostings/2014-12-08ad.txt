Marat Guelman/FacebookThis happened. Its caption says: "MOSCOW, street Neglinnaya, 2 December 2014. A priest is casting out the demons responsible for maintaining the course of the ruble from the servers of the Central Bank." But as great as that sounds, it's only semi-accurate. Yes, it is a real photo of a priest sprinkling holy water on hardware, but unfortunately this has nothing to do with the current struggling Russian economy. People familiar with the shot tell Business Insider that it's actually a photo from back in 2001. The priest is blessing the "payment systems" from a "northern company" called Rapida. (Here's a link to the actual photo — from the deep web — in case you're interested.) Womp womp.    FREE AppDownload
