Dr. Ed's BlogContrary to popular belief, wages have been rising a bit faster than prices. In other words, real wages haven’t stagnated as widely believed, but have been moving higher, albeit at a slow pace: (1) Real hourly wage rate. Average hourly earnings for all workers divided by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (PCED) rose to a record high during February of this year. It edged down in June, but was up 0.4% y/y. This measure of real hourly wages is up 6.7% since the start of the data during March 2006. Using the headline PCED, real hourly wages also rose to a record high during February of this year and are up 5.2% since the start of the data. That’s not great, but it isn’t stagnation either. (2) Real wages per worker. I calculate earned income per worker by dividing wages and salaries in personal income by payroll employment. It was at a record high of $49,500 during June. Dividing this series by the headline PCED shows that real wages and salaries per worker is up 1.4% y/y, and 6.0% since the start of 2006. Again, that’s not great, but it isn’t stagnation either.
