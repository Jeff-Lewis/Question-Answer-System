A man jumped off of JP Morgan's Hong Kong headquarters to his death, according to George Chen of the South China Morning Post. JP Morgan has confirmed that the man who jumped was a 33 year-old employee at the firm with the last name Li. He was a junior banker in operations. This comes at a delicate time for the financial industry, when a spate of deaths — mostly in London — have alarmed observers. Last month, a 39-year-old JP Morgan vice president died after falling from the roof of the bank's European headquarters in London. And right before that, a former Deutsche Bank senior executive was found dead in his London home after an apparent suicide. Witnesses say that police tried to stop Li from jumping from the 30 story building, 10 floors of which are used by JP Morgan, around 2:00 or 3:00 pm, but to no avail.   FREE AppDownload
