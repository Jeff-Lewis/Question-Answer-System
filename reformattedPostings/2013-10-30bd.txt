Starbucks is ubiquitous, but the coffee chain still has plenty of room to grow.  Trefis has released a report showing how customer traffic will continue to increase at Starbucks stores.  While Starbucks stores currently have an average of just over 500 customers per day, that number will grow to more than 750 customers in 2020, according to the report.
