LinkedInSuccessful people don't mess around when it comes to their working space. A desk has to be a place where you can be productive, healthy, and comfortable for many hours, day in day out. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark prefers a sparse desk, while Peter Guber, co-owner of the L.A. Dodgers, keeps his desk "crowded" with memorabilia "to create an un-intimidating environment for business associates." Michael Moritz, Chairman at Sequoia Capital, keeps a bottle of emergency whiskey "for the bad surprise."  And some professionals don't work at a desk at all. As a part of LinkedIn's “View From My Desk” series, some of the most successful professionals in the world revealed where they work. We're publishing the highlights with permission.
