Peter Wallis/REUTERSGood morning and happy jobs day! Today at 8:30 a.m. ET, we'll get the latest Non-Farm Payroll figures for October. Analysts are expecting 120,000 new jobs, and for the unemployment rate to tick up to 7.3% from 7.2%. A full preview is here. Meanwhile, in the U.S. and Europe, markets are pointing up.
