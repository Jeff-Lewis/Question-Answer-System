General Assemb.lyStarting a company is the supreme business challenge. It seems like everything you learn is the hard way. We can't promise that attending Startup will make it easy, but we can promise that you'll learn a ton and gain inspiration and helpful contacts.  This year at Business Insider's Startup 2013 conference we've partnered with General Assemb.ly to run “Startup University.” Choose three classes from a schedule packed with 15 great choices and you'll soak up business lessons from industry leaders. The lineup includes: And many more. For the full list of classes, see the Startup agenda. In the afternoon, you'll hear from top entrepreneurs from NYC and the Valley, VCs, and other experts. We're particularly excited to have the former CEO of Indeed.com -- a company that had one of NYC's biggest exists -- on stage sharing how he did it, along with leading investors John Borthwick (betaworks, investor in Tumblr) and Bijan Sabet (Spark Capital, investor in Twitter). After a great day, enjoy a networking reception with stunning views of the Hudson.  Grab your tickets (at entrepreneur-friendly rates).
