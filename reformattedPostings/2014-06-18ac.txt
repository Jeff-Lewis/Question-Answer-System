BIILegacy payment hardware companies already have tremendous market share in developed markets. But payments startups are forcing these businesses to become more than terminal providers. They are increasingly becoming full-service providers of sales, analytics and mobile products. Ingenico, one of the largest payment terminal providers worldwide, is rebranding itself to communicate its evolution into a "seamless payment services provider," the company said in a release.  The reason for the pivoted focus is that the market for payment terminals in developed markets has stalled, in part, because of the availability of mobile point-of-sale systems that transform smartphones and tablets into credit and debit card readers. In a new report from BI Intelligence, we take an in-depth look at the global payment terminal market. We examine which regions are driving growth and how market share is shaping up in different regions. We also take a look at the three ways mobile technology could eventually kill the legacy payment terminal and assess how big a threat mobile really poses.  Access the Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today &gt;&gt; Here are some of the key elements from the report:  In full, the report: For full access to all our charts, data, and analysis on the payments industry — including downloadable Excel files — sign up and get started.
