Yahoo Daily Ticker Fund manager John Hussman of the Hussman Funds has been hammering on what is probably the biggest risk to future stock performance: The risk that today's record-high profit margins will fall, taking corporate earnings down with them. Those who want stocks to keep charging higher have come up with a list of many reasons why it's "different this time" and today's profit margins will keep on increasing.

Note the sudden and violent mean reversion. And note, too (though you can't see it in the chart), that, at the time, very few people saw this mean reversion coming.

Lauren Lyster of Yahoo caught up with him recently at a benefit. Here's (an unfortunately small) video. You can watch a bigger version here.  FREE AppDownload
