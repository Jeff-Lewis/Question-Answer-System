The name "Citibank" calls up a lot of bad memories in the financial world.  One that stands out is Chuck Prince, Citi's former head, telling the Financial Times in the summer of 2007 that the emerging financial crisis wasn't going to upset his bank's business.  "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," he said. "We're still dancing." Citi promptly faced $45 billion in writedowns and a long saga of bailouts, prompting a spin out of a holdings company with especially terrible assets.  Fast forward to today.  Though Citi is cutting jobs and pulling out of markets, the name still earns respect.

The base salary for an investment banking associate, for example, stands at an average of $116,984. It nearly doubles after bonuses, vaulting to $210,869.  Here's the combined compensation — annual salary and bonus — for 15 positions at Citi, according to Glassdoor:  FREE AppDownload
