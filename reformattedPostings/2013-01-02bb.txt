Getty / Michael NagleStrauss-Kahn and SinclairDominique Strauss Kahn has been forced to borrow money from his ex-wife to pay a civil settlement with a New York maid he was accused of raping, the Daily Mail reports. Former IMF chief DSK settled with Sofitel maid Nafissatou Diallo in December. The Daily Mail reports today that Strauss-Kahn had to borrow "millions" his ex-wife in order to pay the settlement, thought to be worth around $6 million. Former wife Anne Sinclair, one of France's best known journalists, stood by Strauss Kahn for almost two years before it was leaked that she would be leaving him last summer. Strauss Kahn has moved on however, dating social media producer Myriam Aouffir since the break up. Things aren't all bad for the pair — according to the Mail, they saw in the New Year at Le Prince Maurice in Mauritius, where rooms start at "$926-a-night and go up to more than $2000-a-night."
