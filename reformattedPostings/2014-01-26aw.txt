Stephen Brashear/Getty ImagesWant a job that pays well and will have plenty of openings in the next decade? Consider one of these occupations. Business Insider compiled a ranking of the best jobs of the future based on how well they pay and how much they are projected to grow in the coming years. We took the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' projections for the number of new jobs created between 2012 and 2022 and the 2012 median annual wage for each occupation and ranked them based on a combination (the geometric mean) of the two figures.  To focus this list on higher-quality jobs, we ranked only occupations with median wages higher than the 2012 median wage for all workers, which is $34,750. We used the total number of new jobs projected by 2022 rather than the percent rate of growth for the occupations, since some specialized occupations are expected to see steep growth but will provide a relatively tiny amount of job openings.
