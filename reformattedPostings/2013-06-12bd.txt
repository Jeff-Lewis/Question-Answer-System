Hugh Jackman revealed that he missed his daughter's first play to appear at Wal-Mart's annual shareholder's meeting for free.  In a cringe-worthy moment highlighted by MSNBC's "All In with Chris Hayes," Jackman told the audience about the conflict:  "My daughter, Eva, is in her very first school play, which have we got any parents here? All right. Trust me. I'm thrilled to be here, but my daughter is not so thrilled that I'm here. She's like, Dad, can you — I'm a bit nervous. Can you help me learn the lines? And you're going to be there, right, Dad? I'm like, not really," Jackman told the audience.  He then asked them to watch a video clip his wife sent of his daughter performing.  Celebrities including Jackman, Cruise, and Hudson appeared at the event in exchange for promotion of their most recent projects.  As America's largest retailer, Wal-Mart is a huge seller of CDs and DVDs.  Hayes suggested that Wal-Mart could use its power for a more noble cause.  "The reason he's there is because Wal-Mart is so powerful, it has relationships with all the studios, they're not paid for this," Hayes said. "They give them a wish list that, to me, the power to get Hugh Jackman and Tom cruise is the power of this enterprise that if it wanted to could do a lot of other things like make sure Bangladeshi factory building codes work."   Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy FREE AppDownload
