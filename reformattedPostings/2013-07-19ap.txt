CNBC anchor Mandy Drury, who is an Australian native and a former Great Barrier Reef lifeguard, gave tips on how to not get eaten by a shark in a new video posted on CNBC.com. This is an important life hack, so pay attention.

Drury says she likes to wear dark blue, green or black when it comes to her swimsuit. Check it out below:   FREE AppDownload
