Ajay Singh, who helped set up the airline in 2005, was expected to submit a plan on Monday. The official said Singh had sought two to three weeks to finalize the plan. Singh is in talks with U.S.-based private equity investors to raise funds and lead a turnaround of SpiceJet, but talks were taking longer time than expected due to the upcoming Christmas holidays, the government official said. Singh was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by Aditi Shah; Writing by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques) FREE AppDownload
