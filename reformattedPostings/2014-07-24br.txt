REUTERS/Albert GeaFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg smiles as he arrives at the stage to deliver a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Feb. 24. Earlier this week, Facebook reported its Q2 earnings, and it was a huge result on all fronts. The earnings call solidifies Zuckerberg's net worth at about $31.5 billion, given the 422,954,082 shares the 30-year-old owns.  So, there it is – Mark Zuckerberg is one of three people who currently has more billions under his belt than years he has lived. According to Forbes, Carlos Slim touched over it once in 2011 when he was valued at $74 billion at the age of 71. He matched it in 2013 with $73 billion at 73, and despite the fact that as you get older, the bar gets a little harder to leap over, Slim is actually bucking the trend. Bill Gates is worth $80.1 billion at age 58. Zuckerberg has proved himself anything but an idle CEO, and the results of what some have called outrageous spending are paying off in a big way. He bought Instagram for $1bn just before Facebook’s IPO. Crazy, some said. He laid out a staggering $16bn for the messaging app WhatsApp. “Insane.” His most recent big buy – $2bn for VR headset company Oculus Rift – has been widely labeled an extravagant boy’s toy purchase. He doesn’t own a music streaming site yet, although he does have a pretty solid partnership with Spotify that could easily turn into an acquisition, and he hasn’t yet made any noise about a move into video streaming, so there’s still huge growth potential.   This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.
