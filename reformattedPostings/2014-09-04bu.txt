Rightmove.co.ukThe house was listed on Rightmove.co.uk for £235,000. Houses for sale below the $411,000 stamp duty threshold are thin on the ground in London — quite literally in the case of one two-bedroom property in the north of the capital, which is up for auction. Measuring just 84-inches wide, the terrace home in Haringey is barely the width of three wheelie bins. The house, which appears to have been squeezed onto what was once a driveway between two more conventionally sized homes, will go on under the hammer on Oct. 1 and is expected to fetch more than the guide price of $386,000. Buyers will have to sit under the stairs in the super-slim living room, but they do also get a roof terrace. “I think it will appeal to owner-occupiers or perhaps an investor,” said James McHugh of estate agent McHugh &amp; Co, who is handling the sale. A buy-to-let landlord, he said, could rent out the corridor-shaped home for about $2,100 a month. Wider homes on the same street have been changing hands for much more — a three-bedroom terrace is currently on the market for $954,000 — and in a part of London where house prices increased by 23% in the year to July there are slim pickings for homebuyers who cannot raise considerable sums of money. It is not the narrowest house in London — it is a whole foot wider than a 6-foot-wide home in Shepherd’s Bush, which changed hands for $904,000 in 2009.
