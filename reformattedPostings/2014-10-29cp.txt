Germany’s top lender reported quarterly pretax income of 266 million euros, lifted by a 4% pretax profit rise from investment banking. Deutsche's CFO Stefan Krause is also being shuffled into a strategy role as of May 2015. He is being replaced by Marcus Schenck of Goldman Sachs, who will start as Deputy CFO and then take over from Krause fully in 2015. The bank spent 894 million euros on litigation costs in the quarter, bringing to about 7 billion euros the amount the bank has spent on fines and settlements since 2012.
