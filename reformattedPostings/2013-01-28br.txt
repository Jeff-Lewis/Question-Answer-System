Will Bo Xilai go on trial today in Guiyang? Ta Kung Pao reported last week that he would and Reuters followed on with a story in which it wrote that: A Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper, the Ta Kung Pao, reported on Friday that Bo's trial would begin on Monday in the southern Chinese city of Guiyang. But the government has not confirmed or denied this, belying recent efforts to promote transparency and openness, and at least two well-informed sources said on Sunday the reports were not true. However, a third source, who has ties to the leadership, said the trial would in fact begin on Monday in Guiyang. The Global Times says Bo will not stand trial until sometime after the March NPC/CPPCC meetings: The trial of Bo Xilai, former Party chief of Chongqing municipality, is expected to open after the "two sessions" in March, a source close to the country's top judicial body told the Global Times Sunday, denying rumors that the trial would start on Monday in Southwest China's Guizhou Province. "The information in terms of the date and location for the trial will certainly be made public in advance, and it's unnecessary to make speculations," the source said. We will find out today though given the recent precedents of Chen Xitong and Chen Liangyu I do not expect such an early trial, nor does Beijing need to rush things. Meanwhile, Chongqing has moved on, according to Hang Qifan: Chongqing's municipal government vowed Saturday it would shake off the impacts of the Bo Xilai scandal and make law-abiding governance the priority alongside further reform. Huang Qifan, mayor of Chongqing, described 2012 as an "extremely extraordinary year" for Chongqing's development in his report on the work of the municipal government, at the opening ceremony of the 4th Chongqing Municipal People's Congress. There have been rumors since the start of 2013 that the corruption crackdown would net a big fish near the end of January. Politburo member Li Jianguo may be that fish, as MingPao reports (Reuters) that he is under investigation. Li, a  a protege of Li Ruihuan (Dr. Victor Shih on Twitter), was accused on Sina Weibo (South China Morning Post) in December of nepotism.

Never before has the global economy benefited from such an addition of extra human exertion. Now the additions are over—and not just in China (see article).The Tijuana Connection, a Template for Growth - NYTimes.com - But my company, like many manufacturers, is faced with a familiar challenge: its main competitors are Chinese companies that have the dual advantages of cheap labor and top-notch engineering. So, naturally, when we were raising a round of investment financing last year, venture capitalists demanded a plausible explanation for how our little start-up could beat its Chinese rivals. The answer was as much a surprise to the investors as it had been to me a few years earlier: Mexico.
