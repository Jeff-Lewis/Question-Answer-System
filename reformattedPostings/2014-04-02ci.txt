The Nikkei continues to be a solid performer, tacking on another 1% last night. Shanghai rallied 0.5% and Hong Kong was marginally higher as well. In Europe, Germany's DAX is up 0.25%. US futures are just a hair higher. Jobs Week really begins in earnest today as the ADP report, a preview to Friday's Non-Farm Payrolls comes out at 8:15 AM ET. Confidence about this week's Jobs Numbers is starting to rise, as the weather thaws. Yesterday's strong car sales are getting people excited that things really came back strong in March.
