But Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the defect — which was found in fewer than 3% of adapters — wasn't a "recall" at all. "Some confusion in media reports today," he tweeted. "No Tesla vehicles are being physically recalled by Tesla." A Tesla spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that, indeed, "Tesla owners do not need to physically come to a Tesla store or service center." The software update would be mailed. "Recall" or "software update" — is this just a pointless game of semantics? Maybe not.
