JP Morgan Asset ManagementIt's been a tough few weeks for the stock market.  Over the last three months, each of the major averages has lost ground, and as of Friday's close, the Dow turned negative for the year. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is set to wind down its quantitative easing program at end of the month, after which investors will prepare for the Fed's first interest rate increase since 2006.  Also in the background are continued indications that Europe's economy is slowing down, as well as unrest in the Middle East and Ukraine.  Here to help investors navigate these market factors is JPMorgan's quarterly market guide, compiled by David Kelly and the Global Market Insights Strategy Team.  This 67-slide presentation gives investors an overview of what to watch out for in stocks, bonds, real estate, and the rest of the investable universe.  Thanks to JPMorgan Asset Management for giving us permission to feature this presentation.
