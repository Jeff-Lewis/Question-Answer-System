According to Bloomberg News' Kelly Bit, Pershing Square is up 33% for the year. Pershing Square's performance was 0.7% in October, a wild month for the financial markets.  Overall, most fund managers have been struggling to find alpha this year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P is up around 9.5%. Ackman is known for being a mostly long-only investor. He takes large positions in a handful of companies he thinks are undervalued and advocates for changes from management to unlock shareholder value. While he is mostly long, he is famously short Herbalife — a multilevel marketing company that sells weight-loss shakes. Ackman has been crusading against Herbalife for 23 months with a belief the company operates as a "pyramid scheme." He's betting the stock will fall to zero.  This year has also been a comeback for Ackman. In 2013, he had a disastrous bet in the embattled retailer J.C. Penney Co., and Herbalife's stock rose spectacularly. He finished that year slightly under 10%, while the S&amp;P rose 30%.  FREE AppDownload
