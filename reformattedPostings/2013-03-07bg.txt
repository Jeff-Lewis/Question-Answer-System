The yen is falling again today. According to Reuters' Eric Platt, at ¥94.81 the yen is now at its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010.

However, everyone expects incoming BoJ head Hirohiku Kuroda to announce major easing measures in his efforts to stimulate the economy.  Most experts expect this to mean depreciation in the yen against other currencies.
