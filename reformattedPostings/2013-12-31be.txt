Barry Ritholtz, the brains behind the Big Picture blog, is out with his 2014 global market and economic forecasts, and they are brilliant. From his U.S. forecasts: Okay, so what the heck is this about. Well, it's obviously a joke. However, the message is loud and clear: it's foolish to try to predict what'll happen in the near-term.  More often than not, it's just a mentally-frustrating and money-losing exercise. Sure, it's probably a good idea to make short-term, tactical adjustments to your portfolios if valuations scream opportunity. But, this should always be done in the context of your long-term, strategic investment plan. So as you revisit your investments, keep Ritholtz's forecasts in mind. FREE AppDownload
