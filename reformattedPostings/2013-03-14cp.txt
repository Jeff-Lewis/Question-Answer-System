"One merchant claims that a crackdown on the sale of dead pigs forced pig farmers to dump them into the river," said Bill Bishop in his Sinocism newsletter.  "So the good news may be that fewer dead pigs are getting into the food supply, but the bad news is that it used to be very common? Regardless, another reason, if you need one, to avoid processed pork in China." FREE AppDownload
