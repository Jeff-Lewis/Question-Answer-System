Flickr/World Economic ForumCisco CEO John ChambersCisco just reported its quarterly earnings. A lot of eyes are watching Cisco this quarter because it set the bar very low for itself. It warned that revenues would decline by 8-10% over the previous quarter. Cisco reported: Q2 Revenue: $11.2 billion (decrease of 8% year over year) and Q2 EPS of $0.27 GAAP and $0.47 non-GAAP. Analysts expected 46 cents earnings per share on revenue of about $11.03 billion for the second quarter. So that's a beat and good news for Cisco.
