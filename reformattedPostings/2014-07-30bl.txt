But the momentum in the housing market seems to have come to an abrupt halt.  Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen never quite accepted talking of a housing snapback. During her semi-annual monetary policy report earlier this month she said that U.S. housing market was witnessing a lackluster recovery.  "The housing sector, however, has shown little recent progress," she said. "While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing." Here's a quick recap of all the ugly data. The two positive data points we saw include a rise in homebuilder confidence to 53. With a reading above 50 showing that more homebuilders think conditions are good than bad. And, the 2.6% rise in June existing home sales to an annualized rate of 5.04 million. Existing home sales rose above 5 million for the first time since fall 2013, but the weakness in pending sales suggests that this will trend down. The two big constraints on the housing market continue to be tight supply and tight credit. "If we see a material easing in the latter, an easing in the former would not likely be far behind given the improving labor market conditions and pent up demand for housing," writes Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg.
