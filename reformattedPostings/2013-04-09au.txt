The price of a Bitcoin now stands at $234. That is really, really high. Especially given that just three years ago, Bitcoins were worth one-quarter of one cent. It was at this price when, according to Internet lore, Jacksonville resident Laszlo Hanyecz purchased a pizza for 10,000 BTC, or $25. Vice's Brian Merchant actually had this story several days ago. But the pizza was then only worth $750,000. Here's Hanyecz' original post, from Bitcointalk.org: I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day.  I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.  You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.Thanks,Laszlo As user The_egg_came_first points out on Reddit, that pizza has now cost the original purchaser over $2 million at today's prices. At the time, Hanyecz updated a series of photos proving the purchase — here's one: Mike Lazlo This episode is a big lesson and a big cautionary tale: Anyone transacting in Bitcoin is liable to feel like an idiot the next day, as the price surges or collapses. Hence it makes more sense to just speculate, and not do anything real. FREE AppDownload
