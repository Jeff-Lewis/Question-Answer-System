ODA ArchitectureThis place is unreal.This ultra-luxurious penthouse in Manhattan is the home of an extremely private billionaire. So private, in fact, we can't even tell you his name. But we can show you inside the 18,000-square-foot apartment, located a whopping 90 stories in the air with 360 degree views of New York City. It was recently redesigned by ODA Architecture, and the pictures are incredible. The luxurious penthouse contains nearly every amenity you can think of, including a sculpture garden with a 30-foot water wall and reflection pool, a game room, a day spa, and a recording studio, according to ODA. The penthouse's extensive renovations reportedly took ODA four years to complete. Jill Comoletti contributed to an earlier version of this post.
