This all comes after yesterday's Bank of Japan meeting where Hirohiko Kuroda delivered shock and awe with extraodinarily easy monetary policy. Bloomberg BRIEF economist Michael McDonough notes that this is the first time the yen has fallen below 97 per dollar since August 2009.  It's also the first time the Nikkei has been above 13,000 since August 2008.
