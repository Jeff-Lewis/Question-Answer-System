Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesGreenwich, Conn. has some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in America.Much like the rest of the country, America's richest neighborhoods continue to evolve in terms of racial diversity. In his latest Higley 1000, a list of the highest-income neighborhoods in the U.S., Stephen Higley, a professor emeritus of urban social geography at the University of Montevallo, found that the top neighborhoods are home to more Asian and Latino residents than ever before.  Higley ranked the most expensive neighborhoods in America based on American Community Survey 2006 - 2010 data. He aggregated contiguous block groups (subdivisions of Census tracts) with a mean income over $200,000. You can read his complete methodology here. FREE AppDownload
