Furthermore I would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information. Please visit this page for further announcements and updates. Sincerely, Mark Karpeles  The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that MtGox has been subpoenaed by the U.S. Attorney's office in New York, while Reuters reported that Japanese authorities are also investigating the exchange.
