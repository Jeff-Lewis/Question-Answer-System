Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderGood morning! Here's what everyone is talking about today, courtesy of Dave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus: Good Morning!  US Futures are flat this morning, as we await the ADP employment data ahead of NFP tomorrow in light trading – Nasdaq futures are outperforming slightly, continuing the upward momentum from the Citi conference sparking short-covering yesterday (and AAPL!) – FTSE up 50bp as BOE stands pat - The DAX is up small ahead of the ECB decision at 7:45 (Presser 8:30) sas the EU fins popping almost 1% as Yields in the PIIGS retreat again.  Over in Asia, Nikkei was up small as trading closed prior to the BOJ’s decision – no change, but upgraded their economic projections – The Sensex jumped another 2.5% as the new head of the RBI has a cover going in the Rupee and Equities.  Still seeing investor angst in Philippines and Indonesia however.  Autos leading globally The US 10YY is hitting a fresh peak near 2.94% ahead of “taper Data”, and a Dove (Williams) sounded more hawkish than ever late yesterday afternoon – The dollar is flat however – torn between strength in € ahead of ECB, and the yen breaching the ¥100 to the dollar level, the first time since late July, before reversing.   We have a small rally in Metals, led by a 60bp pop in Copper – and the Oil complex has a decent bid to it as War drums grow louder (but today we will be reading of the heavy obstacles in Congress for approving) – more importantly API data showed a huge drawdown in US supplies ahead of DOE data later this AM – and articles highlighting MEND gearing to attack some facilities in Nigeria.
