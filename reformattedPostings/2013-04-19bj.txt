CNNRuslan Tsarni, the uncle of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, erupted in fury Friday over his nephews' alleged role in the Boston Marathon bombings, telling a local television station that the suspects "do not deserve to live on this earth." In a subsequent press conference with reporters, a visibly angry Tsarni lashed out at the two suspects. Tsarni told WBZ-TV in Boston earlier Friday that the two suspects — Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev — do not deserve to live, and he apologized to their victims. “He deserved his. He absolutely deserved his,” Tsarni said of Tamerlan, who was killed early Friday morning. “They do not deserve to live on this earth.” In the press conference, Tsarni called both of the suspects "losers" and he urged Dzhokar to turn himself in. He said that any notion of Islam playing a part in the attacks is "fraud." "What I think was behind it: Being losers," he said. "I respect this country. I love this country," said Tsarni, who was visibly angry throughout the press conference. "This country gives chance to everybody else." Here is video of the press conference: FREE AppDownload
