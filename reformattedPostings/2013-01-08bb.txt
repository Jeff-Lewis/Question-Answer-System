Screenhot via AnyClipIn a recent Portfolio Manager Action Alert note, Goldman Sachs' Robert Boroujerdi makes his case for income stocks. He calls his specific strategy the "social contract" i.e. companies that should offer returns of at least 5 percent in 2013 through dividends and accretive buybacks. Boroujerdi like these stocks because companies have the capacity to pay, investors demand them, and they look more attractive than bonds. Goldman identified 23 buy-rated stocks from various sectors. NOTE: Earnings per share accretion occurs because buybacks lower share counts and therefore boost EPS. All EPS accretion due to share share count change represents a 2013 estimate. FREE AppDownload
