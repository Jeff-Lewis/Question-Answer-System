LATEST: The Kansas City Fed's monthly report on regional manufacturing activity is out. The headline index unexpectedly fell to 2 in September from August's 8 reading. Economists were looking for no change. The decline in the index suggests that conditions are still improving, but at a slower pace. Below is a summary of the data from the release: Growth in Tenth District manufacturing activity moderated somewhat in September but remained positive. Producers’ expectations for future activity increased markedly, while several manufacturers commented on rising labor shortages and wage pressures. Price indexes decreased slightly or were largely unchanged. The month-over-month composite index was 2 in September, down from 8 in August and 6 in July (Tables 1 &amp; 2, Chart). The composite index is an average of the production, new orders, employment, supplier delivery time, and raw materials inventory indexes. The production index decreased at both durable and non-durable goods-producing plants, with the exception of machinery and computer equipment factories which posted slight gains. Most other month-over-month indexes also fell. The production index plunged from 21 to 4, and the shipments, new orders, and order backlog indexes also decreased. The employment index eased after rising last month, and the new orders for exports index fell back into negative territory. The raw materials inventory index stayed flat at 0, while the finished goods inventory index decreased modestly.
