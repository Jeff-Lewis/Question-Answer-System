"The March HMI mirrors last month’s sentiment, as builders continued to be affected by poor weather and difficulties in finding lots and labor," NAHB Chairman Kevin Kelly, said in a press release. The fall in February was the biggest decline on record. The severe winter and concerns about the cost and availability of labor and lots were blamed for the decline in homebuilder confidence last month. The three month moving averages for regional HMI fell across all regions. The three HMI components were a mixed bag in March. A reading over 50 shows that more builders view conditions as good than poor. FREE AppDownload
