The last time short term correlation between treasuries and US equities turned positive was at the beginning of Fed's QE2 in 2010.

Treasuries no longer provide the hedge for equities portfolios that the markets have become accustomed to (see discussion). It may take another crisis to send the correlation back into negative territory. Sober Look   FREE AppDownload
