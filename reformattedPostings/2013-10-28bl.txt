The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday, leaving investors very happy and some market-watchers in awe. Two truly extraordinary stats about the market crossed Twitter this morning. The first came from @StockTwits, which pointed to J. Lyons Fund Management who observed that the S&amp;P 500 hasn't seen a single day in 2013 when it traded negative year-to-date.  That has only happened twice since 1960. The second came from CNBC's @CarlQuintanilla, who credits Peter Shack for observing that the S&amp;P 500 is just days away from closing positively in both September and October. "That's happened only 4 times in past 30 yrs." Bloomberg FREE AppDownload
