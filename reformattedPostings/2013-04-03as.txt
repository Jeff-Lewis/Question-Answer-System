Tesla Motors reached profitability for the quarter — a huge step for the startup — by urging customers who had reserved cars but not yet made their payments to do so, according to Bloomberg. Cory Johnson, editor-at-large for Bloomberg Television, obtained a March email sent by Tesla to a customer, asking for help in reaching the milestone that would help the company and those who drive its cars: Tesla is right on the cusp of profitability this quarter for the first time in 10 years since the company started. This is a huge company milestone that will not only be great for the company, but also for our customers. In order for Tesla to be able to count your Model S for the quarter, we simply need to receive payment. Johnson noted Tesla confirmed the email was accurate. Receiving payments ahead of schedule may have made Tesla profitable for the quarter — and given its stock price a significant bump — but it could leave the electric car company weak for the next quarter, since payments that would have been made in the coming months were made ahead of schedule.
