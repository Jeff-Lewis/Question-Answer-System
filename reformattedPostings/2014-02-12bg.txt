REUTERS/ Mike Blake2013 was a banner year for stocks, but 2014 has started off on a relatively sour note. Markets are down so far this year, but that's actually "helped re-establish more reasonable valuation metrics," according to Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg. In a new note to clients, Rosenberg says clients should keep in mind "that after a year in which the S&amp;P 500 outpaced earnings growth by a factor of four, we were due for a pause and for the economic and profits to play some catch-up to what Mr. Market had already priced in." Rosenberg outlines the nine reasons why we have seen a stock market correction this year. From his note: "So the big problem was sentiment and valuations, but both have started to move towards more attractive points," Rosenberg writes. "Liquidity and economic growth remain the big-picture fundamentals that will once again render this brief corrective phase as another in the long list of buying opportunities we have seen for the past four-plus years."
