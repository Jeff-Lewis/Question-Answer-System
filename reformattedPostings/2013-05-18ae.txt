REUTERS/Yuri GripasFor all the talk of how it's a waste to study American Literature or other majors with limited job prospects, even the Chairman of the Federal Reserve acknowledges a value to cultural pursuits. Ben Bernanke ended his commencement speech at Bard College at Simon's Rock with the following remark: [W]hile I have emphasized technological and scientific advances today, it is important to remember that the arts and humanities facilitate new and creative thinking as well, while helping us to draw meaning that goes beyond the purely material aspects of our lives. From his perspective, America needs more than just engineers, scientists, and doctors. It also needs actors, writers, teachers, and others who inspire creativity. This role may be more important than ever. Bernanke explains in the same speech that America could be entering a period of slower growth. The industrial revolution is ending, while the information technology revolution may not generate as much growth as we have seen in the past. Success in this new economy will require "constant adaptation and creativity." Arts and humanities "facilitate new and creative thinking" and therefore play a fundamental economic role. The role of "helping us to draw meaning that goes beyond the purely material aspects of our lives" may be of growing importance too. After all in a period of slower economic growth, Americans will need to find meaning in more than just work. Call it learning to cope with underemployment or learning to enjoy the wonderful modern world, English Majors can help fill this need. FREE AppDownload
