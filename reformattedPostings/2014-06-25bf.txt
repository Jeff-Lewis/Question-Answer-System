Classic men's jewelry that is sophisticated without going over the top falls into two categories: a wedding ring and a great watch. We visited Bergdorf Goodman's Men's Store to chat with Town &amp; Country Magazine's style director Stellene Volandes about the watch styles and shapes that make great long-term investments. Produced by Alana Kakoyiannis.
