The release will also be followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and accompanied by the Fed's latest summary of economic projections. The SEP contains the GDP and inflation outlooks from Federal Open Market Committee members, and also includes the famous "dot plot." The "dot plot" shows FOMC members' median projection for interest rates at the end of the next three years, as well as over the long term.  Yellen has stressed in the past that the "dot plot" is not a policy tool, but merely reflects what FOMC members think about the future course of interest rates.  The "dot plot" is also a median projection from FOMC members, so it isn't clear what the range of expected interest rates is from various committee members.  We'll have a lot to digest this afternoon, including an updated dot plot. Here's what the dots looked in September. Federal Reserve      FREE AppDownload
