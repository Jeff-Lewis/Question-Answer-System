Zilberman Sands Photography / FlickrDavid Bianco and Deutsche Bank's U.S. equity strategy team believe that the S&amp;P 500 will reach 1,575 by the end of 2013.  If we get a decent deal to address the sequestration, Bianco thinks the index goes as high as 1,600. But within the market, some stocks look better than others. In his latest note to clients, Bianco includes a list of the 30 stocks he likes right now. All of these stocks are buy-rated by Deutsche Bank analysts.  Each have a market capitalization over $10 billion, a price-earning ratio on 2013 EPS below 18, 2013 EPS growth above 5 percent, and a net debt to market cap ratio below 30 percent (excluding Financials).   FREE AppDownload
