Bloomberg Last night, six of Wall Street's brightest hedge fund managers met at the Borgata in Atlantic City for a secret charity poker tournament hosted by Bloomberg TV. The event was called "Poker Night On Wall Street" and you'll be able to watch the whole thing in August (with Trish Regan hosting the Bloomberg TV special), but we've got a few details for you now. There was a $50,000 buy-in and all told the event raised over $300,000 for charity. David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital), Steve Kuhn (Pine River Investments),  John Rogers (Ariel Investments), Jim Chanos (Kynikos Associates),  Mario Gabelli (Gabelli Asset Management), and Bill Perkins (Skylar Capital) all participated. We imagine it got colorful. The last time David Einhorn and Bill Perkins played in a tournament together was during last month's World Series of Poker. Perkins bumped Einhorn from the tournament, and according to Bloomberg, he was loud about it. Perkins shouted "Leeeeeeeeroy Jeeeeeeeenkins" in reference to the World of Warcraft meme as he turned over a pair of aces to beat Einhorn's ace-jack combo. If you've never seen the meme, you can watch a video below (contains NSFW language). In the meantime, you can look forward to seeing all these Wall Streeters face off on TV in a few weeks.  Oh, and here's Bloomberg TV's lovely host, Trish Regan: Bloomberg TV FREE AppDownload
