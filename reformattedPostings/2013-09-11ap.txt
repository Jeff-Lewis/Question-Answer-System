Dr. Ed's BlogIt’s Fashion Week in New York City. It also seems to be fashion week in the stock market, with the bulls strutting down the catwalk while the bears are no-shows. Actually, investment styles have been changing rapidly all year. Consider the following: (1) Dividend-yielding stocks. During the winter season, dividend-yielding stocks were the rage. They fell out of favor during the summer as bond yields soared. For example, S&amp;P 500 Utilities were up by 18.4% ytd on April 30. Now they are up 6.1%. (However, S&amp;P 400 Utilities are still up 16.8% ytd.) S&amp;P 500 Telecom Services is up only 2.7%, well below the peak ytd gain of 15.6% on April 23. (2) Interest-rate-sensitive stocks. Homebuilding and other interest-rate-sensitive stocks were also sold along with bonds during the summer. S&amp;P 500 Homebuilding is down 29.6% since May 14, and down 9.6% ytd. However, Household Appliances and Home Improvement Retail are still up solidly so far with gains of 34.6% and 24.2%. While investors are worrying that rising mortgage rates may slow home sales, they must expect that owners of existing homes will spend plenty of money on remodeling.
