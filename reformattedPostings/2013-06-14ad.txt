flickr/lmgadelhaWhile everyone focuses on the plight of unpaid interns, MBA interns are making out nicely. The average hourly pay for MBAs is $22.97 an hour, and that gets significantly higher for top schools. John Byrne at Poets &amp; Quants compiled a list of average monthly intern pay for top schools. The winners were Columbia and the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business with an $8,000 median monthly salary. Depending on where you go, the number gets even higher. The average consulting intern gets $10,500. There's a reason these companies pay so much. It's a great way to get the inside track to hiring top students. Some 48% of Booth graduates end up taking a job at the place they interned the previous summer.  Here are the schools that come out on top:  Poets&Quants FREE AppDownload
