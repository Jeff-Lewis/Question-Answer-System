Flickr/MattHurstThis week's JOLTS report brought us new data on the state of the U.S. job market — and it was a mixed bag.  While the U.S. added 120,000 jobs and layoffs dropped more than 12%, quits and hiring painted a less optimistic picture. Nick Colas at ConvergEx Group highlighted the three major takeaways from the BLS' report. Colas pointed out that this economic cocktail is particularly hard to stomach for young college graduates. More than half of employed recent grads are in jobs where a college degree is not a prerequisite, Colas notes. "Truly 'Discouraged workers?' Check. Mismatched skills? Check. Weakened purchasing power? Yep, that too.  Especially problematic is that we are not talking about the working population as a whole.  These are the kids in line to inherit leadership positions in an uncertain economy… and look how they’re starting off," he writes.
