 Natural gas is a trump card for Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the crisis in Ukraine, and this 2009 kitschy video from Russian gas giant Gazprom could very well be the Kremlin anthem right now. European countries are reluctant to sanction Russia for the invasion of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, partly because Gazprom supplies Europe with so much gas (map below). “Europe gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia so any sanctions that it threatens will be hindered by its dependence on Russian natural resources," Seva Gunitsky, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, told the National Post. Meanwhile, Russian troops continue to surround Ukrainian army posts on the strategic Black Sea peninsula, firing warning shots at one air base, while they urge the Ukrainians to pledge allegiance to Kremlin-backed authorities. Here are some choice lyrics from the song: Don't bother trying, you'll never ever findA surer friend than Gazprom... Let's drink to you, let's drink to us,Let's drink to all the Russian gasThat it never comes to an end,Though it's so hard to obtainLet's drink to you, let's drink to usLet's drink to all the Russian gasFor those extracting the new sunFrom down beneath the ground ...We're renowned for our deedsThe world overAnd all your troubles will recedeIf Gazprom people are nearby Here's a map of Europe showing how heavily EU countries rely on Russian gas imports: REUTERSMap of Europe showing how heavily EU countries rely on Russian gas imports.
