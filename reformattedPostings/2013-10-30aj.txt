U.S. Treasury, Haver Analytics, Barclays ResearchThe U.S. Treasury Department just released its fiscal-year 2013 and September budget results. The September budget surplus was $75.1 billion (versus the $69 billion estimated by economists). Perhaps the more notable figure is the fiscal-year 2013 deficit, which at $680.3 billion is at a five-year low. Revenues from tax receipts hit a record high of $2.77 trillion in 2013, while spending was $3.45 trillion — down from $3.54 trillion in 2012. "We expect the deficit to continue to narrow in the coming months, although likely not at the record-setting pace seen during the past year," says Barclays economist Cooper Howes. FREE AppDownload
