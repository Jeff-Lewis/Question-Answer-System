YouTubeA former top Dutch bank CEO, his wife, and their 22-year-old daughter were found dead this weekend inside their family home located in Laren in The Netherlands.  According to a newly released police statement (via Google translate), Jan Peter Schmittmann, 57, the former head of ABN Amro Group NV, killed his wife and daughter before taking his own life. Police found the bodies of the three deceased family members on Saturday morning. The initial police report suspected that it was the result of a "family drama." The Dutch Forensic Institute confirmed that suspicion, the report said. A suicide note was also found inside the home, the report said. The police said they will not comment on the time of death, the manner of death, or the contents of the suicide note, the report said.   The eldest daughter was not in the home at the time. "We are deeply shocked and beaten by this unimaginable news. We knew that Jan Peter struggled with severe depression, [but] that [it] would eventually lead to these events is still incomprehensible to us. Our first concern . . . [is] now supporting the other daughter of the family in the processing of this indescribable grief . We hope to be able to do [so] in peace and seclusion," the Schmittmann family said in a statement.  FREE AppDownload
