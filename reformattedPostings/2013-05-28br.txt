Richmond Fed manufacturing beat this morning. Case-Shiller home prices beat this morning. And last week we had beats on jobless claims, durable goods, and other numbers. Yes there's the whole risk of the Fed "taper" out there, but it's hard to be negative unless you're just one of those folks who gets knee-jerk negative when other things are good.
