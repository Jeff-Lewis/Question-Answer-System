MarkitThe preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report for July is out, and the numbers are encouraging. The headline number jumped to 53.2 from 51.9 in June. This was better than the 52.6 economists were looking for. Any number above 50 signals expansion. Here are the key points from Markit: Here's some commentary from Markit's Chris Williamson: “The U.S. manufacturing sector picked up momentum again in July, with output, order books and employment all growing. The goods-producing sector acts as a bellwether of the wider economy, and the upturn in July therefore bodes well for the pace of GDP growth to have picked up again in the third quarter after a likely easing in the second quarter. “The pace of manufacturing growth nevertheless remains well below that seen at the start of the year, in part reflecting weaker demand from many export markets, notably China and other emerging economies. Employment growth is disappointingly weak as a result, as firm focus on cost-cutting to boost competitiveness. “The Fed will therefore be encouraged by signs that the sector is showing signs of reviving, but will no doubt remain cautious with regard to the longer- term outlook for the economy and the job market. It is likely that policymakers will generally need to see growth strengthen further before sounding more confident about the ability of the economy to withstand any tapering of stimulus.” PMI reports from earlier this morning showed that Europe was picking up while China was slowing down.
