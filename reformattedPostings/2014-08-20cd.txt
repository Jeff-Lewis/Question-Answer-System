In March, the company said it saw 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.70-$2.00 on revenue of $11.4-$11.7 billion.  In a filing with the SEC on Tuesday night, Hertz said it expects its results to be "well below" the low-end of this guidance. Hertz also said it will conduct a review of its financial record for 2011, 2012, and 2013, and asses the impact, if any, on its 2014 results.  Some of the challenges that Hertz said will hamper its results include: In addition to withdrawing its guidance, Hertz announced that the lead independent director of its Board, George Tamke, will retire.  FREE AppDownload
