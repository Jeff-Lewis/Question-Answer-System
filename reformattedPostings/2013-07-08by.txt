Flickr/JasonLangheineIt was not a pretty start to the week for major Asian markets. The Nikkei had started off by rallying 1%, but by the end of the session it fell 1.4%. Shanghai, which has been strengthening a bit, had a rough day, with stocks losing 2.44%. Hong Kong fell 1.3%, and Korea fell 0.9%. Things are looking better in European trading, where Germany's DAX is up 1.5%, and Italy is up 0.7%. It's likely to be a bit quieter week than last week (there's much less economic data coming out). The big headlines will come from Bernanke's speech on Wednesday. FREE AppDownload
