Nuveen Asset ManagementOne of the more anticipated annual lists of market predictions comes from Nuveen Asset Management's Bob Doll, the veteran investment strategist who previously held top posts at BlackRock and Merrill Lynch. As usual, Doll sees stocks rising this year. But he expects the ride to be much bumpier than it was in 2013. "Skepticism about the durability of the equity rally remains widespread as many argue that stocks have become expensive and that profit margins are unsustainably high," said Doll. "We think those potential headwinds will limit, but not prevent gains, and perhaps cause more volatility than was experienced last year. While stocks are vulnerable to a correction any time given their recent strength and some technical deterioration, we continue to favor a moderate pro-growth posture with forward long-term potential to mid- to high- single-digit annual percentage gains." At a breakfast on Monday, Doll presented the charts behind his 10 predictions.  He also offered his longer-term forecasts.  Somewhat surprisingly, he thinks the average annual return in U.S. stocks for the next ten years will be a lackluster 6%-8%. We got a copy of Doll's presentation, which includes the charts and stats that are behind his investment framework.
