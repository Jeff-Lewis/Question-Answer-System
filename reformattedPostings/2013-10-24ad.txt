CEO Jeff Bezos's press release contained a shout-out to New York Times write Nick Bilton, who wrote a column recently explaining the FAA's decision to allow people to leave the Kindles on during takeoff and landing of airplanes. The statement said: In the last 90 days, our AWS team …  scored a win for customers who want to use Kindles on airplanes even during takeoff and landing (also, a big hat tip to Nick Bilton on that one), ... (Bilton has been more famous recently as the author of a new book about the difficult birth of Twitter.) Here's the current guidance for Q4 2013:     •    Net sales are expected to be between $23.5 billion and $26.5 billion, or to grow between 10% and 25% compared with fourth quarter 2012.    •    Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(500) million and $500 million, compared to $405 million in fourth quarter 2012. Here's what analysts were expecting: Among the issues investors will be hoping that CEO Jeff Bezos addresses on the call are, whether the company will make any move to become more profitable; and progress on the development of its new grocery home delivery service, AmazonFresh. We're also hoping that Bezos might have something special up his sleeve in terms of devices: Either something for TV or — outside chance, admittedly — an Amazon smartphone.
