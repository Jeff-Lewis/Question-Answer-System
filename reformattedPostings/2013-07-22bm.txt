A second floor awning helped break his fall, the report said. The financier's father-in-law told the Post that Silberman has been depressed over a fight with the co-op involving the family's three French poodles.  Apparently neighbors had complained about the dogs barking and one of them had to be sent away, the report said.  Police sources told the Post that they found "crack paraphernalia" in the home. A friend of Silberman's told the paper that he doesn't abuse drugs or alcohol.  Silberman runs Solas Investments, a private equity fund, holding company and investment banking consultant group that specializes in luxury, fashion, lifestyle brands and the consumer sector, according to his LinkedIn. His interests include boating, shooting, food, luxury sector, retailing and real estate, his profile states. He also lists swanky private clubs—the Core Club and the Metropolitan Club—as organizations he's affiliated with.  Here's an image of the 860 Fifth Avenue building where Silberman jumped:  via StreetEasy FREE AppDownload
