REUTERS/Carlo AllegriThe ADP jobs report is out, and the numbers are encouraging. U.S. companies added 200,000 jobs in July, which was more than the 180,000 expected by economists. Also, the June payrolls number was revised up to 198,000 from a previous reading of 188,000. "Job growth remains remarkably stable," said Moody's Mark Zandi. "Businesses are adding to payrolls in most industries and across all company sizes. The job market has admirably weathered the fiscal headwinds, tax increases and government spending cuts. This bodes well for the next year when those headwinds are set to fade.” "The ADP report, which has become more reliable recently, could influence expectations for Friday, although its misses can still be sizable," said High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan who's looking for 190,000.
