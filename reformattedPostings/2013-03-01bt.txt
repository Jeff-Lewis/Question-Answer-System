BoeingMarkit's final US PMI manufacturing index reading for the month of February is out. The headline index fell to 54.3 from the flash estimate of 55.2 published by Markit earlier this month. Anyt reading above 50 indicates expansion, though, and 54.3 represents a moderate pace of growth. However, the new export orders sub-index, the main driver behind the decline, indicated contraction in February, falling to 48.5 from last month's 51.5 reading. So, it looks like exports took a hit. The sub-index for all new orders fell to 55.4 from 57.4 last month, and the employment sub-index fell to 53.5 from 55.6, indicating a slowing but still moderate pace of expansion.
