Herbalife Here's the part about raising guidance.  Note a short-seller (a.k.a. Bill Ackman) is mentioned in the release.  Updated 2013 Guidance Guidance for fully diluted 2013 EPS is based on the average daily exchange rates of January 2013, which in aggregate are not materially different from the foreign currency exchange rates assumed in our prior guidance. Our 2013 guidance continues to assume a Venezuelan exchange rate of 10 to 1. The guidance does not include the one-time impact associated with the revaluation of our bolivar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, which includes our bolivar denominated cash, due to the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, or any potential one-time impact from a future devaluation or the repatriation of existing cash balances. Guidance for the year also excludes one-time costs of $10 million to $20 million, mostly legal and advisory services, relating to the Company’s response to information put into the marketplace by a short seller which information the Company believes to be inaccurate and misleading. Based on current business trends the company’s first quarter fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2013 guidance is provided below. Herbalife Herbalife has become one of the most controversial stocks lately. That's because hedge fund titan Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, has publicly declared that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife with a price target of $0.  The premise of his thesis is that he believes Herbalife is a pyramid scheme and regulators will be induced to investigate the company. Herbalife has denied Ackman's claims saying he used "outdated" and "inaccurate information" when putting together his massive 342-slide short case presentation.  This stock has also created a hedge fund clash of the titans. On the long side, hedge fund hot-shot Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, disclosed an 8.24% stake in the company back in January.  Loeb is said to have pared back some of his stake, but still remains one of the largest shareholders, according to CNBC's Scott Wapner. In addition, legendary billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who is a long time Ackman rival, disclosed a 12.98% stake in Herbalife which includes shares underlying call options.
