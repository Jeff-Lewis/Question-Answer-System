And it's exactly what we got today. 195,000 new jobs for the month of June was very nice, and nicely ahead of expectations of 165,000. And last month was revised up to 207,000 from 178,000. The dollar is strengthening, yields on bondsare rising, and gold is getting crushed, but importantly, stocks are higher too, so there isn't a fear that this is going to accelerate the Fed's tightening schedule. In other words, things are good, but they're not so crazy good that the Fed will be forced to quickly end the party with an early rate hike. In fact, because unemployment remained at 7.6% — contrary to expectations of 7.5% — and  because there was a rise of part time and undermployed workers, the Fed keeps ample breathing room, even though the pace of job creation is picking up. This is really the market sweet spot. For full details of today's report, see here. FREE AppDownload
