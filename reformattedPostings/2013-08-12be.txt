Herbalife has been in the news a lot lately because its stock is in the the middle of a heated hedge fund battle between Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn. Late last year, Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, publicly declared that he's shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife stock. Ackman believes that the company is a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals.  As a result, he thinks regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to investigate it and shut it down.  His rival, Carl Icahn, purchased a massive stake in the company and said that he thinks Ackman will be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes." Herbalife is a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutritional products such as weight loss shakes and vitamins.  We decided to try Herbalife's Formula 1 shake, the company's best selling product.   Watch the video below: Produced by William Wei
