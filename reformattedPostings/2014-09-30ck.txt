Dr. Ed's BlogYesterday, we learned that personal income rose 0.3% during August, while the personal consumption expenditures deflator decreased less than 0.1%. On a y/y basis, the former is up 4.3%, while the latter is up 1.5%. So real incomes are growing at a solid pace. There is a widespread myth that real incomes have been stagnating for many years. That’s apparently true based on mean real income for households. I have lots of issues with this statistical series, including the impact of demographic trends on it. Consider the following: (1) While real mean income per household has been stagnating since 2000, real pre-tax compensation per payroll employee (including wages, salaries, and supplements) is up in record-high territory at $61,307 during August, which is an increase of 16.8% since the start of 2000. (2) Real wages and salaries in personal income is also in record-high territory, up 1.8% y/y and 14.6% since the start of 2000. Real average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers is up 1.1% y/y and 13.4% since the start of 2000. Dr. Ed's BlogToday's Morning Briefing: Life After QE.
