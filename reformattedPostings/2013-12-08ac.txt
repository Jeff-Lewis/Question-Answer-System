ReutersThe People's Bank of China officially announced the inter-bank negotiable certificate of deposits (CDs) on Saturday. The interest rate on these CDs will be determined by the market. These certificates of deposit "can help banks secure a more stable funding source and offer liquid and safer  underlying securities for investment products targeting individual investors," writes Societe Generale's Wei Yao.  Individuals, governments, and non-financial companies can't jump into this market just yet, but they can tap into it through funds and finance companies, says Bank of America's Ting Lu.  While this move was anticipated, it signals an important step in interest rate liberalization. China has yet to scrap its ceiling on deposit rates, which experts argue is the most important and challenging step in the process to true interest rate liberalization. We've previously explained why it's so difficult to liberalize deposit rates. Yao expects Beijing to scrap the ceiling on long-date deposits, implement a deposit insurance scheme, and pass a bankruptcy law for financial institutions in the near term. Here are the key guidelines to the certificates of deposit from Yao: Banks can begin issuing CDs starting Monday. FREE AppDownload
