The protests in Hong Kong don't seem to be coming to an end anytime soon, and thousands of people have taken to the streets so far, some of whom are camping out all night. Drone footage taken at night shows just how big the demonstrations have gotten: The protestors have taken to holding up lit smartphone screens toward the sky, which explains the tiny blinks of light you see in the drone footage. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaProtesters hold their mobile phones as they block the main street to the financial Central district, outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong. The protests — dubbed "Occupy Central," or the "Umbrella Revolution" — have primarily been fueled by younger Hong Kong residents who are angry at what they see as Beijing's slowly taking away Hong Kong's democracy. China recently placed restrictions on Hong Kong's 2017 election of its top civil leader, saying the candidates would have to be vetted by Beijing, according to CNN. There are also economic concerns relating to inequality and the price of housing. As many as 50,000 protestors are blocking streets in the busy city. (via Carmen Ng) FREE AppDownload
