REUTERS/Mike StoneMichigan fans cheer.Consumer confidence in the U.S. is on the rise. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index jumped to 82.5 in August, beating expectations for a print of 80.0. This was also much stronger than the preliminary estimate of 79.2, and the 81.8 in July. "Consumer expectations had fallen sharply in early August, presumably due to the stock market swoon early in the month, but most of that decline was retraced in the second half of the month," said Barclays' Dean Maki. The current conditions index ticked up to 99.8 from the preliminary print of 99.6. This is the highest level since 2007. The outlook index was revised up sharply to 71.3 from 66.2. This comes amid an improving U.S. labor market and despite geopolitical turmoil overseas. "The rebound was strongest among high income households, who reported more favorable trends in their income and wealth," Maki said. "Overall, consumer confidence remains in the relatively tight range it has occupied this year and is consistent with continued moderate growth in consumer spending." FREE AppDownload
