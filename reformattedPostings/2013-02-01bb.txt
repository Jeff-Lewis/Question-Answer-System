Michael Dell is on a mission to take his $23 billion PC company private once again, and a deal could be struck as soon as Monday.  The final details are being worked out, Reuters reports, and everything is expected to be finalized over the weekend. Dell, the company's founder and CEO, will use up to $15 billion in debt financing to reclaim the company from Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital. Silver Lake Partners and Microsoft would become minority investors. Dell is putting a lot on the line to gain back majority ownership, including his 15.7% stake and up to $1 billion of his personal funds. Making Dell private would allow its executive team to take bigger risks while attempting to save the company from a tanking PC market.  FREE AppDownload
