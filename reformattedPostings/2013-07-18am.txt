Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for Mitt Romney's campaign, took a few shots at President Barack Obama amid news of Detroit's bankruptcy filing late Thursday afternoon. Williams linked to a story of Obama saying last October — amid a heated presidential campaign — that he "refused to let Detroit go bankrupt." *Ahem* RT @TheStalwart: DETROIT FILES LARGEST MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY IN HISTORY http://t.co/WEEoEFxwhB Romney opposed an auto bailout in a November 2008 op-ed in the New York Times, which was memorably titled, "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt." That op-ed argued arguing that General Motors and Chrysler should be put through a managed bankruptcy process instead of getting a taxpayer bailout, and had nothing to do with a municipal bailout. Detroit became the largest U.S. city in history to file for bankruptcy, as the state-appointed emergency manager filed for Chapter 9 protection in a federal bankruptcy court. A big population drop — and a big drop in its tax base — were the biggest factors contributing to its dreadful financial situation, according to the bankruptcy filing.  FREE AppDownload
