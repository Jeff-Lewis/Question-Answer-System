AP A new poll released Thursday showed the majority of New Yorkers do not like Donald Trump.  The NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll found 61 percent of New York City voters have an unfavorable impression of Trump. Only 36 percent were found to have a favorable impression of the reality television star and four percent were undecided.  Trump, who has made a habit of publicly flirting with the possibility of running for president, has indicated he might be interested in running against Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo this year as a Republican. The poll found Cuomo would defeat Trump 70 percent to 26 percent with 5 percent undecided. According to the poll, Cuomo would also easily defeat his other two likely potential rivals, Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and Buffalo, N.Y. businessman Carl Paladino.  FREE AppDownload
