As many of 708 private equity firms are facing a brutal deadline — attract investors over the next few years or face fee reductions, Bloomberg reports. From 2006 to 2008, PE attracted $702 billion in investment capital. However, since the financial crisis crushed their returns, investors have been moving their money elsewhere. Only the strongest funds will be able to fund raise adequately, and some estimate that 10-25% of PE shops will shut down.

TPG’s boom-era funds -- an $18.9 billion vehicle raised in 2008 and a $15.4 billion vehicle from 2006 -- were generating returns of 2.5 percent and a negative 4.9 percent annually as of June 30, according to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a TPG investor. KKR’s annual return on its $17.6 billion fund from 2006 was 6.9 percent as of Sept. 30. That combination of underperformance and funding needs has set the stage for a purge as investors pull the plug on the weakest firms.
