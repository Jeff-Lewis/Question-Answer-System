Think debt, taxes, and spending are at all-time highs these days? It turns out that belief is almost totally false. A presentation from the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes three charts that everyone should see. It turns out, taxes are lower than they have been throughout most of history; debt as a percentage of GDP has been much higher in the past; and on government spending, only if you include transfer payments (like Social Security) is spending at a new high relative to GDP. If you look at actual government spending that doesn't go straight to people, it's low.
