The reason the deficit has swollen is not because of some big entitlement/big government crisis, but because unemployment has surged. The deficit will get much smaller as unemployment continues to drop. So it's cool to see more stuff like this from mainstream pundits, like David Frum: Daily Beast In the post, Frum notes that the deficit is down 9 percent from last year, mostly due to the improving economy.
