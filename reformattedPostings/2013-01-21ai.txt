Al Roker looks like he's having the time of his life at the Inauguration Day parade in Washington.  First, the NBC weatherman managed to score the first post-inauguration "interview" with President Barack Obama, after shouting him down along the parade route. "I think we can pretty much assume that it's going to be a failure," Roker said, before hollering: "MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! HOW'S IT GOING!" To everyone's amazement, Obama actually responded: "It's going great!" he said with a thumbs up. "IS THE WEATHER GOOD?" Roker yelled back. "It's great!" Obama replied.  Here's the video, courtesy of NBC:   Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy   Roker had even better luck with Vice President Joe Biden a few minutes later. The exchange — and Roker's mic drop — are pretty priceless.  FREE AppDownload
