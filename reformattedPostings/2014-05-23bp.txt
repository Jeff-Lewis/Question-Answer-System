Today's largely expected to be a quiet one as U.S. traders and investors prepare for the three-day Memorial Day weekend. At 10:00 a.m. ET, we'll get the latest monthly new home sales report. Economists estimate the pace of sales jumped 9.4% to 420,000 in April. "Lagged effects from the weather and ongoing supply and affordability issues likely prompted the sharp drop in new home sales in March," said Nomura economists. "Mortgage applications for home purchases increased in April, but the current sales of single family homes subindex within the survey declined in April, suggesting that there probably was little improvement in new home sales in April." U.S. futures are currently trading higher with Dow futures up 11 points and S&amp;P 500 futures up 1.6 points. FREE AppDownload
