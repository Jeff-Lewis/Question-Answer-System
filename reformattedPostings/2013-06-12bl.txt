Thanks to to the tireless tweeting of Hamptons Handyman Joe Schwenk (aka HamptonsBorn), we know about a fairly serious confrontation that happened this morning between a hedge fund manager and his generators, a neighbor with a hatred for noise, lawyers, private security, and the cops. We imagine that the hedge fund manager, identified only as "Mr. C",  probably needs those "movie set" generators — Bloomberg machines suck up a lot of power. It all started out early this morning: Things quickly escalated.... Twitter, @HamptonsBorn Things started to get tense... Twitter, @HamptonsBorn Naturally, young traders were confused (note: No slickbacks in this crowd)... Twitter, @HamptonsBorn And then... the true clash — lawyers and private security versus the Hamptons police....
