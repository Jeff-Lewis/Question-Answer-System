Now that the market seems to be going nowhere but up, an analyst has posted the exact opposite case for stocks on SumZero, a networking site for buy-side researchers. And users are hating it. Ben Michaud, an analyst at a large, New England-based investment firm with several billion in AUM, was kind enough to let SumZero share his slide deck, entitled "Sell American. I Am." Maybe you'll take to it more kindly than SumZero users did. They've rated Michaud's thesis the worst of all time —0.3 out of 100.00. But perhaps that's because this isn't what anyone wants to hear right now. And for the record, Michaud's firm does not endorse this thesis, it's his own independant work. FREE AppDownload
