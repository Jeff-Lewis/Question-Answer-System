via Sotheby's International RealtyThe penthouse of New York City's Pierre Hotel hit the market for a record $125 million in late April. But the property, which belonged to late investor Martin Zweig, has yet to find a buyer, and recently had its price slashed by 24% to $95 million, according to The New York Daily News. Zweig initially listed the apartment for $70 million in 2007 but later pulled the listing; he died in February. The apartment encompasses three floors and was originally the hotel's ballroom. The 16-room spread is listed with Sotheby's International Realty. FREE AppDownload
