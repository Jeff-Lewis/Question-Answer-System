The Tie BarConsider this short a public service announcement. On Wednesday and Thursday of this week online men's accessory shop, The Tie Bar, is teaming up with Michael Carl of Vanity Fair to give men a 15 minute wardrobe boost. We're not talking a full-on suit change. Carl will just be upgrading the little things — socks, neckwear, suspenders, pocket squares... subtle stuff. The event was created with Wall Street — and any other guy who has to show up to work in a suit, we suppose — in mind. "When The Tie Bar offered me the opportunity to talk to finance guys about updating their looks I instantly said yes," Carl told Business Insider. "Guys that work in finance have been experimenting with tie and shirt combos for a while and I think are ready for the next step…how to pair the shirt and tie with a pocket square or a tie bar. Just because you work on Wall Street doesn't mean you cant be creative with the way you dress." Show up in at least a dress shirt and slacks, walk away with some goodies. It's that simple. On Wednesday Oct. 1st, the van will be parked in the Financial District by Stone Street and Hanover Square from 11am – 7pm. On Thursday, Oct. 2nd, it will be parked in Bryant Park from 11am – 7pm.
