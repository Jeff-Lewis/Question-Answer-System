It's been a historic month for equity fund inflows, and the final week of January was no exception. This week, total flows into equity funds amounted to $18.8 billion, making it the third-largest week on record. Click here for a detailed breakdown of this week's fund flow data &gt; In a note to clients this morning titled "Sell-Signal Triggered," BofA Merrill Lynch strategist Michael Hartnett says flow signals are now pointing to a decent-sized sell-off. According to Hartnett, last time this signal was triggered, in January 2011, an 8 percent correction in global stocks followed over the course of February and March. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR Global Hartnett writes, "On average, a 'sell' signal precedes a 5 percent correction in global stocks over the subsequent 4-5 weeks." We've seen a lot of similar calls from other strategists in recent days. Citi strategists, for example, sees these flows as seasonal, which indicates to them that a correction is looming.
