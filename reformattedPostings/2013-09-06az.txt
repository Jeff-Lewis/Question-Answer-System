Given today's fast-changing financial landscape, it isn't always easy to know if you're making the smartest investments or saving enough for the future.  It's not enough to invest your money and forget about it. How do you make your money last through retirement? How do you find growth in unexpected markets? What topics should you discuss with your financial advisor?  To answer those questions, you need an expert. With that in mind, we're collaborating with OppenheimerFunds on a new video Q&amp;A series, Ask A Financial Expert. If you have a question about managing your portfolio, saving for your investment goals, or how market forces might have an affect on your investing strategy, submit it to us, and an OppenheimerFunds financial expert may address it in one of three upcoming videos. Submit your question in the comments, email it to us at expert@businessinsider.com, or tweet it to us with the hashtag . You can also vote for one of the four questions below.  You have until Sept. 12 to submit your question for consideration. By sending us a question, you're giving us permission to edit it. In case we pick yours, let us know how you’d like to be identified in the video. And be sure to come back and watch our first video in the series on Oct. 14. <U+2028>Please note that the information that will be provided by OppenheimerFunds is for educational and informational purposes only, without any express or implied warranty of any kind.
