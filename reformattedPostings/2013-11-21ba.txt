Ultimate Factories/National Geographic Television And FilmCore inflation for October climbed 0.2%. Analysts were expecting a gain of 0.1%.  Headline inflation, which includes food and energy, came in in-line, falling -0.2%. Prices for passenger cars climbed 1.7%. Finished energy goods prices fell 1.5%. Intermediate components prices fell -0.4% in October, the largest decline since a -0.6% drop in April. Core inflation hasn't breached a 0.2% gain in at least 12 months. Headline inflation hasn't climbed more than 1% in at least a year. "In year-over-year terms, the core PPI is up only 1.4%, and there is scant evidence that the trend will turn higher anytime soon based on upstream prices: Intermediate-stage core prices are up just 0.8% year-over-year, but crude-stage prices are down -5.1% over the same period," Deutsche Bank said. However, they note that ,"core service inflation in the October CPI was 2.3% year-over-year compared to core goods prices which are down -1.2%." Thus, "...muted goods inflation is masking sturdier underlying trends in consumer services which account for roughly 60% of the CPI." FREE AppDownload
