WikimediaJesse Livermore.Jesse Livermore is perhaps the most famous stock trader of all-time. Back in the early part of the 20th century, Livermore made and lost millions shorting the market. "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" by Edwin Lefevre, a fictionalized account of Livermore's path from small-time bucketeer to big-time stock trader, is one of the most widely-read and revered books on trading. In the introduction to a recent edition of "Reminiscences," William O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily, wrote that, "in my 45 years of experience in this business, I have only found 10 or 12 books that were of any real value — Reminiscences is one of them." Today, many in the market know Jesse Livermore from the pseudonymous Twitter account of the same name. And while the modern "Livermore" offers some some great market commentary, the real Jesse Livermore offered the most incisive commentary on markets, all of which still holds up today. Back in early 2013, Raymond James strategist Jeff Saut reflected on Livermore in his weekly commentary, writing that, "Years ago I studied the tactics of Jesse Livermore, along with a number of other stock market operators, and have found many of those strategies to be as valid today as they were decades ago." In that commentary Saut included Livermore's 21 trading rules, written in 1940.  More than 70 years later, these are rules every trader needs to keep in mind: FREE AppDownload
