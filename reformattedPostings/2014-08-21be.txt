A Ford spokeswoman said Thursday none of the affected vehicles were sold to customers and that less than 50 were on U.S. dealer lots. Some C-Max and Focus models built at the Michigan Assembly Plant outside of Detroit from Aug. 8 to Aug. 15 may not have enough ball bearings in the steering gear assembly, the notice to dealers obtained by Reuters said. This could lead to a loss of control, increasing the risk of a crash. The Ford spokeswoman said more details regarding the issue would be made available later today.     (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Bernadette Baum) FREE AppDownload
