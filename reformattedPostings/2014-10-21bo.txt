CitiAbout two weeks ago, as stocks started to look as if they were cracking a bit, everyone was talking about one major technical indicator on the S&amp;P 500: the 200-day moving average. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 breached that level for the first time since November 2012, with predictions that once the S&amp;P 500 fell below about 1,905 it would keep dropping. But in the past few days stocks have rebounded, and now we are back at the 200-day moving average, putting the market at a bit of a show-me point. In an email on Tuesday, Tom Fitzpatrick and the technical analysis team at Citi said: "The S&amp;P 500 is testing decent resistance at 1,904-1,907 where the 200 day moving average converges with the August low. A close above here would add weight to the bias that the correction seen over the past month has likely ended." In early trade on Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 was up about 14 points to 1,918, popping above the resistance level mentioned by Citi. So now we see if it holds. FREE AppDownload
