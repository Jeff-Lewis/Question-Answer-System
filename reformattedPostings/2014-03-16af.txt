REUTERS/Scott OlsonAs usual, investors are nervous. The S&amp;P 500 is just 2% below its all-time high. Meanwhile, harsh winter weather continues to distort economic data, which are only providing a murky look at what's going on in the economy. Meanwhile, the tension on the Russia-Ukraine border has some saying we're facing the worst east-west crisis since the Cold War. Among other things, this week's schedule will be highlighted by the Federal Reserve's two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Fed members led by Janet Yellen continue to be under pressure to unwind easy monetary policy as the threat of inflation lingers. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Earlier this month, Citi U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich offered some guidance on how investors should think about the crisis in Ukraine. From his March 3 note: "Geopolitical risks are always a concern but direct impact is needed to undermine equities in a significant way. The history of international conflicts having much impact on US equities is very limited and thus a much larger conflict would be needed to have considerable negative impact. The Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the late 1970s, for example, generated a grain embargo from the US that had severe consequences on the American farm economy that took years to unwind and recover from, but the Georgian conflict, the Iraq-Iran War, Kosovo and even the current Syrian civil war have had very marginal impact..." Investors in U.S. stocks appear to have much less to worry about than investors in Russian stocks. "[T]he worst case scenario that Russia becomes uninvestible (capital controls, such as in Malaysia in 1998, and even the expropriation of foreign owned assets in Russia) with Russia kicked out of MSCI GEMs cannot be entirely ruled out," warned UBS's Geoff Dennis.
