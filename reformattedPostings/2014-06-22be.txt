Revel was supposed represent the future of Atlantic City. However, this gleaming 57-story $2.2 billion dollar casino has been a financial disaster. After a nearly 6 year saga of construction halts, union protests, and government assistance, it opened to great fanfare in May 2012. It was supposed to revitalize the city and provide a resort like alternative to smoky, windowless casinos. But Thursday, it was forced to file for bankruptcy for the second time in two years. Management warned employees that it could be forced to shut down as early as this summer. Former Business Insider reporter Simone Foxman was there to photograph the Revel as it started. Here's a look at how things have gone downhill. FREE AppDownload
