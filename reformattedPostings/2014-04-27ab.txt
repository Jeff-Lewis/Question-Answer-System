[Update Monday: one of the copies has sold for $49.

The hashtag “#Worldisfukt” quickly became a trending topic on Twitter in Australia after the error emerged. The paper’s editor, Michael Stutchbury, apologised to WA readers, telling Mumbrella the error had occurred because someone had “pressed a wrong button”.
