Futures markets have begun trading to start the week as Cyprus attempts to negotiate the final details of a plan with the EU to bail out its troubled banking system. This is ahead of an ECB ultimatum that a deal be reached by Monday or the liquidity taps will be turned off. Despite the heated backdrop, markets are mostly flat Sunday evening. S&amp;P 500 futures are trading around 1551, down just 0.03 percent from where they closed on Friday. The very far right side of the graph shows Sunday evening's trading session.
