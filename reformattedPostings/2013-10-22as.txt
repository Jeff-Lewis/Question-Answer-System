But now the WSJ has the break down. For the record, the Justice Department has decided not to make JP Morgan pay punitive damages for mortgages sold by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, since JPM essentially helped the government out by buying the banks as they were collapsing. So that's nice, but the figure will still stay at $13 billion. Now for the numbers: According to the WSJ, all the drama surrounding this deal started on September 24th, the day the DOJ set a deadline to file a civil suit against the bank over MBS. The day before, JPM called and offered $3 billion, which the DOJ refused. Then JPM called back and said they'd negotiate a higher figure if they didn't have to go to Court. That brings us to now. After the government shut down ended, lawyers at the DOJ told JP Morgan they had six days to cobble an agreement together. What that means is that we could have a finalized agreement by this week.
