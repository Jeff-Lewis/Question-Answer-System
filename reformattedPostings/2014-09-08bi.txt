Courtesy of ZillowZillow CEO Spencer Rascoff.   Tech IPOs are back on the mind of investors ahead of Alibaba's IPO, which is expected later this month Rascoff says that for a tech company, there are usually one or two main questions it must address ahead of its offering, and that within a couple years, these questions are usually answered for better or worse. Since going public in back in July 2011 at $20 per share, Zillow shares have more than sextupled in value, though the stock followed Rascoff's model.  After just about two years as a public company, Zillow's stock price really took off, as the company perhaps began to answer to some investor concerns. And with this experience Rascoff offers a great perspective on the challenges Alibaba is likely to face in the coming weeks, months, and years. Here's Rascoff's full tweetstorm. 1/ Interesting to think of recent tech IPOs &amp; how investors’ questions at #IPO time played out.  2/ I’m oversimplifying, but usually there are just 1 or 2 questions that #IPO investors debate on a new issue. 3/ The q for $FB IPO was mobile monetization. Investors at #IPO time disagreed on their chances on mobile.  4/ Clearly $FB “figured out” mobile monetization, and #IPO investors who were long $FB benefited. 5/ The q on $TWTR #IPO was about potential audience reach and explaining the service to newbies.  6/ Secondary question at $TWTR #IPO was on mobile monetization.  7/ Some are still debating those $TWTR #IPO questions, but I am bullish and have put $ where mouth is.  8/ The q on $LNKD #IPO was whether the service could go mainstream &amp; be useful to non-job-switchers. 9/ Clearly $LNKD #IPO investors who were long got it right.  10/ The question at $ZNGA &amp; $KING #IPOs was whether they were hit-driven. Early results not looking good. 11/ Main question at $ZU #IPO was about their ship-times (too long?) and impact on total addressable market.  12/ The question at $TRUP $SSTK $CRCM &amp; $GPRO #IPO was about market size.  13/ The question at $GRPN #IPO was about “deal fatigue” &amp; transition to “push” ecommerce. 14/ $CHGG #IPO was about their transition to digital.  15/ Question at $YELP #IPO was about $GOOG threat and market size  16/ $P #IPO was about $AAPL &amp; @spotify threat, + mobile monetization.  17/ $AWAY #IPO was about their switch from paid listings to commission model 18/ $GRUB #IPO was about @grubhub @seemless M&amp;A integration, + market size  19/ $ANGI #IPO question was about sustainability of charging for content. 20/ Alibaba $BABA #IPO debate will be about valuation and transparency of financials.  21/ My point is with all of these IPOs: the debate among investors at #IPO time was usually the right one.  22/ Different investors came out with different perspectives on the fundamental issue facing an #IPO.  23/ Over the following 1-2 years post #IPO, the answers became obvious.  24/ #IPO investing is not for the meek. 25 / #IPO twitterstorm complete. ###         FREE AppDownload
