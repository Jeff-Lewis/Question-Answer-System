AFPGunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson was down more than 11% in early trading after the company slashed its full-year sales expectations for the second time in two months.  On Tuesday, the company said full-year sales were now expected to be $530 million to $540 million, well short of current estimates for about $593 million, and also sharply lower than the $585 million to $600 million expectations the company laid out in June.  The company also said that for its fiscal first quarter that ended July 31, Smith &amp; Wesson reported revenue of $131.9 million, lower than the $133.4 expected by analysts, and down $39.2 million from last year. The company said lower sales of long guns, including modern sporting rifles, drove 87% of this first-quarter decline.  Gross profit in its first quarter was $49.1 million, down from $72.8 million in the prior year period, and the company earned $0.26 per share, slightly better than the $0.25 expected by Wall Street. Smith &amp; Wesson said, however, that handgun sales showed "continued consumer demand for the company's small concealed carry polymer pistols and revolvers." "We believe that the current environment reflects high inventories industry-wide resulting from channel replenishment that occurred following an earlier surge in consumer buying," Smith &amp; Wesson CEO James Debney said in a statement. "That environment, combined with typical seasonality that slows consumer buying activity during the summer, is causing us to lower our financial outlook for fiscal 2015." Debney added: "We expect the industry will continue to deliver growth over the long term." FREE AppDownload
