Tom Montag will become sole COO of Bank of America when his former co-COO, David Darnell, moves to Tampa to be with his family, DealBook reports. Montag left Goldman Sachs in 2008 to join Merrill Lynch before it merged with Bank of America. Since then he's climbed the ranks to run Bank of America's investment bank and capital markets divisions. Additionally, for the past four years he's made more than CEO Brian Moynihan. Last year Montag made $15.5 million and Moynihan made $14 million. In a memo to employees Moynihan wrote that despite his move Darnell would still “work across the company to execute our customer strategy, drawing on his knowledge of our businesses, markets and client relationships.” Darnell, who may retire soon, will take the title of vice chairman and continue to oversee business banking as well as global wealth and investment management. Montag will continue running investment banking and capital markets divisions. FREE AppDownload
