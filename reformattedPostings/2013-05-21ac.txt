Students fear entering a job market that doesn't want them, and losing vital years of their careers.  Great advice is needed more than ever. In its latest "Influencers" series, LinkedIn asked 70+ top professionals, from Fortune 500 CEOs to media icons what the class of 2013 needs to succeed.   Some share their commencement speeches while others share the things that they wish they knew before starting out.
