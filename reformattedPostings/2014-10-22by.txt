(Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co &lt;dow.n&gt;, the No. 1 U.S. chemical maker by sales, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit for the fourth time in a row, helped by higher sales in its plastics and performance materials business units. The company's shares rose nearly 6 percent before the bell. Dow's performance plastics unit, which makes products for toy manufacturers, builders and car makers, has benefited from access to relatively cheap natural gas, thanks to the shale boom in the United States. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at the unit, the company's biggest by sales, rose 31 percent to $1.27 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Dow is adding capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia to keep feedstock costs low. The first units of Dow's $20 billion joint venture with Saudi Aramco are expected to come online in the second half of 2015. EBITDA at the company's performance materials grew 61 percent to $506 million. Dow's net income available to common shareholders rose 43 percent to $852 million, or 71 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Adjusted profit was 72 cents per share, higher than the average analyst estimate of 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dow, which makes everything from insecticides to plastics, said revenue rose 5 percent to $14.41 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $14.31 billion. Up to Tuesday's close, Dow's shares rose nearly 17 percent over the past 12 months. They closed at $48.21 on the New York Stock Exchange.   (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) FREE AppDownload
