This is a chart that we haven't run in a little while, but it's still fantastic. It shows initial jobless claims (in red, flipped upside down) vs. the S&amp;P 500 (in blue). Yesterday, initial jobless claims fell to their best level since the crisis ended. And the stock market hit an all-time high. Any time someone says the market is just being juiced by the Fed, show them this relationship as evidence that what really matters is the real economy. It keeps getting better, and the market is following along. FRED FREE AppDownload
