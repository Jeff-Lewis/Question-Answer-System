The Cyprus stock market once had a good run. Opened in 1996, it reached as high as 5,500 points in the fall of 2007. That was just before the country entered the Eurozone. But right now the Cyprus market is closed indefinitely as a result of the country's financial meltdown. And as soon as it reopens, it will restart one of the greatest wipeouts in market history, as TD Securities' Richard Gilhooly notes in an email sent to clients. The market's already fallen 94 percent since the Greek crisis began three years ago. Right now, the market trades around 100. Here's the chart showing the collapse since 2008: Bloomberg.com  Even before Lehman, the CSE had already fallen back to 3,300 points by Summer 2008. Gilhooly says when trading restarts, it could instantly fall another 50 percent, and something larger is not out of the question. "The size if the market is tiny, but could still offer insights into the total damage inflicted on the island economy," Gilhooly said in a note. "For reference, Iceland fell 95% from peak to trough by March 09." Gonna get ugly. FREE AppDownload
