Flickr/Michael PatrickWe recently did a head-to-head comparison of the benefits of living in California versus those for Texas. California won by a hair.  The impetus for the piece was the burgeoning rivalry between the two states, which heated up after Texas Gov. Rick Perry ran a series of ads touting his state's friendlier business climate. But we wanted to narrow in a bit more on all the things California has to offer that Gov. Perry may have ignored.  To be clear, we have nothing against Texas — some of us are products of their finest schools.  We just think people need to be reminded that the Golden State still has a lot going for it.
