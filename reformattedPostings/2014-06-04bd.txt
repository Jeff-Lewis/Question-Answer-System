REUTERS/Scott OlsonU.S. stock futures have pulled back a bit following the ADP jobs report missed expectations.  Dow futures are down about 29 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures are lower by 4.5 points and Nasdaq futures are down 10 points.

Its a busy day for data, with U.S. trade balance, ISM non-manufacturing data, and the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book report all expected later today. FREE AppDownload
