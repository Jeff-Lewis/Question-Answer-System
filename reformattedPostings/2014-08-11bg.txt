Reuters Brazilian paper O Globo reports that the car was sold to a dealership for $1.1 million. The sticker price for one of these babies new is about $1.6 million. So Batista didn't get a bad deal, but maybe he didn't really enjoy the car while it was his, either, considering that it was sitting in his living room and was said to have a little over 1,200 miles on it when sold. Must have been nice while it lasted. The car was launched on the public in 2012. And, being the seventh-richest man in the world at the time, Brazilian mogul Batista bought himself a white one. Around the same time he told Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle that by 2015 he would be the richest man in the world, replacing Mexico's Carlos Slim. "Just give me time, let me work please," he told Ruhle. Unfortunately for Batista, he has since fallen on hard times. That same year the oil fields that his flagship company OGX was developing turned out to hold far less black gold underground than surveyors had anticipated. Batista had bet the farm though — the farm being his then-$35 billion holding company, EBX — on the success of these fields, particularly one he called "Hammerhead." Slowly his six-company empire started to crumble. Now creditors are calling in debts. For example, Mubadala Investment Corporation, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund that once made a $2 billion investment in Batista's companies, has been forced to restructure its debt and take a stake in his mining company. Give it one last good look and say goodbye. Reuters  FREE AppDownload
