After a brief rally Monday morning, oil prices are tumbling again. Brent Crude spent much of the day below $60 per barrel for the first time since mid-2009. As of 4:30 p.m. GMT, Brent is back to $60.95, down just 0.43%. WTI, the other major oil price benchmark, fell to just $54 during the day That's down by almost half from where it peaked for 2014 this summer, at $107.26. It's now back up again at $57.13, up 1.54%. Here's Brent: Investing.com, Business Insider The slide since the summer has almost halved crude oil prices. Keep an eye on WTI: If it drops to $53.63, it will have fallen by 50% in half a year. The recent and particularly sharp slump in prices since late November came after OPEC, the oil-producing cartel, was unable to agree on a production cut. That's now gone so far that the United Arab Emirates' oil minister suggested that the bloc might be happy with oil falling to $40 per barrel, according to Bloomberg. The collapsing prices are having knock-on effects elsewhere in the world. Russia's emergency interest rate hike has failed to stop the collapse of the ruble, which has been falling in tandem with oil over recent weeks. And in the UK, inflation dropped to a 12-year low, driven in large part by the fall in oil prices translating into cheaper fuel.    FREE AppDownload
