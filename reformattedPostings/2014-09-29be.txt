REUTERS/Carlos Barria  It's the second day of major protests in Hong Kong, and the crowds in Hong Kong's central business district are unreal. By many accounts they're significantly bigger than they were the night before, as many protesters camped out all night. The protests — dubbed "Occupy Central" — have been primarily fueled by younger Hong Kong residents, angry at what they see as Beijing's slowly taking away Hong Kong's democracy. China recently placed restrictions on Hong Kong's 2017 election of its top civil leader, saying the candidates would have to be vetted by Beijing, according to CNN. There are also economic concerns relating to inequality and the price of housing. School classes have been suspended because of the protests, which don't seem like they'll be letting up soon, CNN reports. Riot police were brought in to control the crowds and were shooting tear gas and pepper spray at protestors.
