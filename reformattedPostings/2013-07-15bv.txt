But it's probably a mistake to suggest stocks are at an impasse. After all, the economy is just beginning to get strong enough that the Federal Reserve has only recently begun talking about scaling back its ultra-easy monetary policies. This week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke heads to Washington D.C. to update Congress on the economy. We also get a load of top-shelf economic data. On top of all of that, we're knee deep into earnings season. This week, we'll get Q2 results from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Yahoo!, CSX, Bank of America, and General Electric. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Much has been made about the surge in small cap stocks, which is tracked by the Russell 2000. "Client conversations this week focused on the drivers and sustainability of recent small cap performance," said Goldman Sachs' David Kostin. "The recently-reconstituted Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 580 bp in the last two months (12.1% vs. 6.4%) as both rose to new all-time closing highs." Small-cap stocks aren't just smaller companies. Their risk exposures are such that they benefit more from an outperforming U.S. economy. "Small caps’ leverage to US economic growth explains our EPS growth forecasts and much of their recent performance," said Kostin. "Roughly 80% of Russell 2000 sales are derived domestically, compared with 66% for the S&amp;P 500, which is more exposed to foreign economic growth and FX. Our economists expect that US GDP growth will accelerate from about 1.5% now to over 3% in 2014-2016. The high exposure to domestic growth also insulates small caps from recent investor concerns about the impact of a strong dollar and uncertain EM growth on US corporate earnings." FREE AppDownload
