NRF via Jim O'Sullivan Black Friday sales are down this year. Total spending over the Thanksgiving weekend was $50.9 billion, about 12% lower than last year's $57.4 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. At first glance, it would appear to be a troubling indicator of consumer health. But the historical data shows that Black Friday sales actually reveal next to nothing about how well holiday sales are going to do on the whole. The above chart from High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan shows the year-over-year percentage change for the past five years. Black Friday sales have gone up and down, but holiday sales overall have grown at a pretty steady pace of 3% to 5%.  This chart below from Capital Economics, which is a couple of years old, makes the point even more clearly. There just isn't a lot of correlation between Black Friday and holiday sales overall.  Capital Economics / Neil Irwin (via Matt Yglesias and Neil Irwin) FREE AppDownload
