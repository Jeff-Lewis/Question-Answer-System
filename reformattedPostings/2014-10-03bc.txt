It has come to our attention that while some of you out there would love to dress fresh to death at all times, you believe that achieving that goal is beyond your means. It's not. Affordable men's fashion is everywhere, and with a few key pieces, you can make your wardrobe look crisp and tidy. Business Insider reached out to some of our favorite men's fashion bloggers and retailers to get their opinion on where to get a stylish wardrobe without breaking the bank. Think about it: They love clothes, but a brother still needs money to eat. We've organized this list by item, and with each item we've included a list of awesome retailers — including some you've probably never heard of — that carry what you need, in a reasonable price range.
