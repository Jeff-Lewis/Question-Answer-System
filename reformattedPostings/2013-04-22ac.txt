Amid the gold crash, retail purchasers of gold are still buying heavily. From Reuters: A customer looks at bangles before purchasing them at a gold showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi April 19, 2013. Gold rebounded above $1,400 an ounce on Friday as strong buying of coins and bars continued, primarily in Asia, but prices were still on course for a fourth week of losses after a brutal sell-off. Gold retailers struggled to cope this week as parents buying dowries, casual shoppers and tourists snapped up bars, coins, nuggets and jewellery as a slump in the price of the yellow metal released years of pent-up retail demand.
