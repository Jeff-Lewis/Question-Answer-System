servantofchaos/flickrThis is a brutal week for those Wall Streeters who are cramming for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). On Saturday, they'll be taking the Level I exam of the CFA. The CFA curriculum, which consists of three levels, is considered to be the hardest test on Wall Street. To put it in perspective, fewer than 20% of candidates pass all three on the first try. The average test-taker also spends a solid five to six months preparing for the CFA. Of course, every test-taker hopes things go smoothly and according to plan on exam day. But we've heard some crazy horror stories ranging from bathroom disasters to concentration-breaking distractions. We've included them here.  Make sure this doesn't happen to you.  Also, if you have a CFA horror story to share, feel free to email jlaroche@businessinsider.com.
