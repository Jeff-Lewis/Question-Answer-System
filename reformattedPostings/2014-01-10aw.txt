With great cinema comes great YouTube trailer mashups. We've already seen The Wolf of Wall Street intercut with Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life, so how about another one that will redefine your childhood? Here we have it. The Wolf of Sesame Street, complete with Liam Neeson and Katy Perry cameos. Enjoy:  (Disclosure: I found this trailer because I wanted to make a "Wolf of Sesame Street" joke on Twitter and I was sure somebody else already had).  FREE AppDownload
