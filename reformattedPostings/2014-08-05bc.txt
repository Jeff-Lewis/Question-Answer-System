REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton A trader outside the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 6, 2008. Stocks are sliding. The Dow was down as much as 200 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 was off 19 points, and the Nasdaq fell 33 points.  Headlines about Russian troop movement near the border of Ukraine is one possible explanation for what's spooking stocks. "Moscow has around 20,000 troops deployed in battle-ready formations on the border, according to senior Nato military officers — significantly more than the 15,000 U.S. officials said were deployed there last week," the FT's Sam Jones and Roman Olearchyk report. "While the number is still well below the 40,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine in April, the sharp rise in just a few days has been a cause for significant concern among Western military powers." There has also been a ramp-up in talk that the Fed could accelerate the end of its dovish environment monetary, either through accelerating the tapering of its bond-buying program or raising interest rates sooner than expected.  Among the biggest losers were Intel, Target, and Groupon, which reports earnings after the bell Tuesday.  FREE AppDownload
