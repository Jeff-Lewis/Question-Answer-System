The remarkable ride for Bitcoin traders continues today. The virtual currency is now trading at $115, nearly double where it was yesterday, when Bitcoin plummeted to a low of $60 following a 12-hour trading halt on the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. On Wednesday, the currency topped out at $266 after staging an incredible run from levels around $15 in January. The chart below, which goes back to April 6, shows the big crash this week and the big rebound over the last 24 hours or so. bitcoin.clarkmoody.com FREE AppDownload
