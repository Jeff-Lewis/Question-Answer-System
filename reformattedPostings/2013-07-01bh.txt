REUTERS/Nikki KahnConstruction spending missed expectations in May, rising 0.5% month-over-month. Economists polled by Bloomberg were looking for a 0.6% rise. Construction spending was up 5.4% from a year ago. April's number was revised down to show a 0.1% rise, compared with an initial reading of 0.4%. Private residential construction was up 1.2% MoM and 23.1% year-over-year (YoY). Meanwhile, public residential construction was up 1.6% MoM and 4.1% YoY. Overall residential construction was up 1.2% on the month and 22.7% on the year. Investors watch this number because it offers insights into the housing market and into homebuilder stocks. It also helps gauge the health of the economy as companies and the government invest in new infrastructure when they are feeling confident about the economy. FREE AppDownload
