Bank of America subsequently announced that it is raising its dividend to $0.05 from $0.01 per share. In April, the Fed required Bank of America to resubmit its capital plan and to suspend planned increases in capital distributions after the bank disclosed it had incorrectly reported data used in its calculations.
