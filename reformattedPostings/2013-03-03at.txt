Getty Images/ Scott HalleranWall Street is a super competitive place. So it should come as no surprise that some hot-shot athletes end up working there.  We've included a round up of some of the best athletes on the Street.  Our list includes Olympic swimmers and rowers as well as former professional football players and a race car driver.   These athletes work in positions from sales trader and broker to managing director and hedge fund manager.    Some of the athletes are still working on The Street, while others have retired.  We even found some who haven't stopped competing since taking up finance and one who left to pursue a career as a professional athlete.   If you feel like someone should be included on this list, feel free to send us as email at jlaroche@businessinsider.com.  FREE AppDownload
