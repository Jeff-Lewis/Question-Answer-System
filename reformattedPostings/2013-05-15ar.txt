Dave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus offers up four things he's hearing from his trading desk. AAPL getting crushed again today – Many reasons bantered about for the weakness – Bottom Line, heavy MoMo pressure (Still Long)  "Hearing" IAEA Says Talks with Iran Have Failed - that's what has bounced Brent - Increased geopolitical risk ---&gt; Time for profit taking?  While we see WTI Flat on the session, Brent has moved up 1% quick…  Reversion into Bonds, with 10YY off 6bp quick during this move.  10YY has ripped 50bp in short order, so some buying going on – especially after BOJ’s overnight actions  Financials are coming off quick – Maybe the spike in yields causing concerns on Builders – the momentum group?  Homebuilders go red.  Lotta profittaking there - that is the mo downside group in this slide  13F filings – many pointing to the vast liquidation of Mo stocks like AAPL – but this is all in the rear-view mirror, and should not be a factor  Shorts have come off in a hurry, with most short 110bp off highs and only o/p SPX by 30bp right now FREE AppDownload
