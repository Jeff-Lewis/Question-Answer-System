If you're looking to find a wild turkey, your best bet is to hit the US heartland. Nine out of 10 states with the most turkeys were found in the middle of the country, according to a new report by Trulia, which tracked the number of turkeys the US Geological Survey found in a given county over a 2-1/2-hour survey time period. The No. 1 county for turkeys? Roger Mills, Oklahoma, where you can find approximately 29 turkeys in 2 1/2 hours of looking around. Take a look below to see if your state is overstuffed with turkeys, too. Trulia   FREE AppDownload
