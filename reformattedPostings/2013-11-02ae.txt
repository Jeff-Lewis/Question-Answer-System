REUTERS/Edgar Su  Facebook came out with earnings this week, and the reaction was somewhat farcical. The stock exploded immediately on news of a strong earnings and revenue beat and a good outlook. Then all those gains evaporated on the conference call as the company admitted for the first time that teens were starting to cool on the site. But still, the stock has gone on an incredible run, and now sits jut below $50 per share. So where's next from here? Citi analyst Mark May came out with a note on Friday outlining how the company can get from where it is now to $70/share, which would represent a 40% gain. The potential gains for the company is summarized in this chart, which we'll explain further below. Citi As you can see, Citi foresees Facebook growing its value by turning on various revenue drivers that don't currently exist. A big one is simply the company's core CPMs. Right now, Facebook ads are worth less than other ads, and this is something that Citi believes the company will be able to rectify thanks to its superior data on its users. May writes: "In short, our analysis suggests that by assuming only a modest 2% 10-year eCPM CAGR leads to $339mn, $885mn and $1.6bn in incremental revenue in CY14, CY15 and CY16, respectively" Here are the other drivers: So says Citi, turn on all these things, apply a reasonable valuation to these businesses, and in a few years you're at $70/share.
