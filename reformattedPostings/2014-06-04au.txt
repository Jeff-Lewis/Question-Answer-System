Business InsiderInstitutional Investor's Alpha has released its annual hedge fund employee compensation report for 2013 and the numbers are looking great for folks on the buyside. Even though only a small handful of hedge funds managed to outperform the S&amp;P, which closed up about 30% in 2013, compensation for hedge fund portfolio managers skyrocketed.  From Institutional Investor's Alpha:  ...Fueled by fat bonuses, total compensation for senior portfolio managers rose 27.6 percent, to $1,465,468, according to the 2014 Hedge Fund Compensation Report by Institutional Investor's Alpha. Junior-level portfolio managers did even better, with their compensation surging 81.3 percent over 2012, to a mean of $887,717.  Based on those numbers, life looks better on the buyside. Then again, 2014 isn't looking so hot for most hedge funds. The average hedge fund is up a little over 1%, while the S&amp;P is up nearly 5%.  FREE AppDownload
