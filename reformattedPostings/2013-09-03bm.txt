REUTERS/Tom MihalekHome prices (including distressed sales) climbed 12.4% year-over-year in July, according to CoreLogic's latest home price report. This is the seventeenth straight monthly rise in home prices. Prices were up 1.8% month-over-month. Excluding distressed sales (short sales and REO transactions), home prices were up 11.4% on the year, and 1.7% MoM. We already saw S&amp;P Case-Shiller home prices slow to 12.07% YoY in July. Economists have been calling for a slowdown in the pace of home price growth in the second half of the year. "Looking ahead to the second half of the year, price growth is expected to slow as seasonal demand wanes and higher mortgage rates have a marginal impact on home purchase demand," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at CoreLogic in a press release.
