APDurable goods orders unexpectedly fell in November by 0.7%. Nondefense capital goods (or core capex orders) showed 0.0% growth. Both numbers are below expectations. Expectations were for orders to increase by 3.0%, and for core capex orders to increase by 1.0%. "Durable goods orders from the Census Bureau are subject to frequent revision; however, at currently reported levels, we view the data as consistent with a slower pace of investment spending and manufacturing activity," Barclays' Jesse Hurwitz said. In October, durable goods orders unexpectedly increased by 0.4%, which was better than the 0.6% decline expected by economists. However, core capex orders — which are an indicator of business spending — unexpectedly fell 1.3%. Economists had forecast a 1.0% increase. FREE AppDownload
