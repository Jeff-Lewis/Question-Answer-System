Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderA Bloomberg terminal.A group of financial firms led by Goldman Sachs are close to buying the instant-messaging startup Perzo Inc., according to a Wall Street Journal report. They might even announce the acquisition as early as next week. In total, 14 firms have joined together to find an alternative to Bloomberg's trader chat service.  Among the members are Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and others, according to the report. The messaging startup, Perzo, was founded by the former Microsoft and Skype executive David Gurle. That so many rival financial services companies have joined together to buy another messaging service is a strong indicator of the "discomfort some in the industry have with Bloomberg's grip on the messaging service." The Bloomberg terminals cost $20,000 a year, and banks are looking for cheaper alternatives — especially now that revenue has been "challenged" by low interest rates, according to the report. Michael Bloomberg certainly came back to helm his company at an interesting time. FREE AppDownload
