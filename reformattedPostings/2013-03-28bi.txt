Walter Hickey/BISeveral days ago, we published a slide deck of 12 math problems designed to stir up controversy.  The response was enormous — millions of clicks, more than a hundred comments, and a barrage of angry emails. One problem, however, caused by far the most dissent: The Monty Hall Problem, a problem inspired by the famous game show Let's Make A Deal. Here, we'll go into even more detail to prove one of the most contested ideas in all of math.  If you didn't get it on the first go around, don't worry. Even Paul Erdos, one of the most respected and prolific mathematicians in history, didn't believe the result until he saw a computer simulation.  This one goes out to all the Monty Hall "Truthers" out there. You know who you are.
