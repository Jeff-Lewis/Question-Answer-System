pepe50 / FlickrOn Monday, Shanghai stocks cratered over 5%. On Tuesday, it was looking like it was going to be another bloody day, with stocks deep into the red into the second half of trading. But somehow the market found a bid, and ended virtually flat. Same with Japan. It had appeared that the market was going to end down over 1%, but in the end the market ended flat. And now we're generally seeing green across the board. Italy is up 0.7%. France is up 1%. Germany is up 0.9%. U.S. futures are higher. In general, the mood is much different than it was early yesterday, when everything is cratering. Stability for now. FREE AppDownload
