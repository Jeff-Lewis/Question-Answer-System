Flickr / zilverbat.Good morning! It was another huge day in Japan, where the Nikkei gained 2.88%. The index has had a few big days recently, as it goes from being one of the ugliest markets of the year to being a bit less so. Meanwhile, everything else is quiet. European stocks are a shade in the red while the US is a little bit in the green.

Even then, all economic data right now seems to have an asterisk next to it, as everyone wonders whether it is weather related. FREE AppDownload
