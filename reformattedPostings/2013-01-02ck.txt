Larry1732 / FlickrNOTE: The PMI was initially reported as 54.2.  However, the number has since been corrected to 54.0. The December reading of the US purchasing managers index is out, and the number looks good. PMI jumped to 54.0 from 52.8 in November.  This is also better than economists' expectation calling for  53.6. Any reading above 50 signals expansion in the industry. Here are key points from Markit: From Markit's Chief Economist Chris Williamson: “The final Markit PMI came in slightly below the earlier flash estimate but still indicates that the U.S. manufacturing sector enjoyed a reasonably strong end to the year. Production is growing at a solid pace, buoyed by rising domestic and export sales. “Firms are also taking on more staff, suggesting that the underlying improvement in demand pushed any worries about the ‘fiscal cliff’ to backs of manufacturers’ minds in the closing weeks of the year. “With recent indications that growth is also picking up in other key economies around the world, notably in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, and that the Eurozone’s economic crisis is easing, U.S. companies should benefit as stronger demand lifts exports in early 2013. While economic growth may disappoint in the fourth quarter compared to the 3.1% rate of expansion seen in the third quarter, the recent run of positive PMI surveys towards the end of 2012 suggests that prospects have begun to look a little brighter for the new year.” Here's a complete breakdown of the numbers: Markit FREE AppDownload
