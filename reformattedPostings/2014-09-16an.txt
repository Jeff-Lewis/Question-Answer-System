The 52/48 split is the same registered in a YouGov poll late last week. In all three of the polls, it's clear that the "yes" vote has gained momentum ahead of Scotland's date with destiny — but the momentum has failed to yield a majority for supporters of independence. According to the Opinium poll, among voters who say they are absolutely certain to vote, 45% say they would cast their ballot in favor of splitting off from the UK, while 49% would choose to remain in the union.  Opinium Still, the "yes" vote has picked up clear steam over the past month. In ICM's August survey on the referendum, published in The Scotsman, the "yes" vote was at 45% and the "no" vote stood at 55%. Both positions have shifted 3 points in the opposite direction. A vote for independence could cause massive ramifications throughout Europe, and it would lead to a host of immediate questions for Scotland: Would it be able to still use the British pound, which fell to its lowest level in 10 months on news of the polls? Would it be able to stay a member of NATO? And would it be able to gain re-entry into the E.U.? A "yes" vote would also likely embolden other secessionist movements throughout Europe — what geopolitical expert Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, called the "contagion" effect.  Despite tightening polls over the last month, most analysts still expect Scots to vote "no" on the referendum.
