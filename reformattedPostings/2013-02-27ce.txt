BoeingDurable goods orders data for January are out. Orders decreased 5.2 percent, worse than expectations of a 4.8 percent decline. The drop was led by orders for defense aircraft and parts. However, nondefense orders excluding aircraft (core capex) rose 6.3 percent, way above expectations of no growth. Durable goods orders excluding all transportation equipment rose 1.9 percent, exceeding expectations of a 0.2 percent gain. Shipments of nondefense orders excluding aircraft and parts fell 1 percent. Economists predicted a 1.3 percent decline. December data were revised down across the board, but the revisions don't even begin to offset the gains observed today. "The standout within the report is rising demand for capital goods seen as a proxy for future business investment in the economy," wrote Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson in a note following the release. "The report confirms the improving health of the manufacturing sector, which we continue to feel is helping fuel demand across the remainder of the economy as rising business confidence translates into growth in investment activity."
