American Psycho screengrabWhoever dressed the cast of American Psycho (2000) nailed the flamboyant men's style of the 1980s. The closer you look, the more on point you realize they were. So lets take a deep dive. In the film, no character escapes the signature 80s details — the low gorge on the lapels, wide shoulders and the long jacket length. And Patrick Bateman looks perfect in his Valentine Couture suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.   Pinstripes are a must, as is condescension and an AmEx.  Leave the humility at home.   Justin Jeffers is the editor of The Fine Young Gentleman.
