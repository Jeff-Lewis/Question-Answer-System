A war is always brewing for your coffee dollars between Starbucks, McDonald's, and Dunkin' Donuts. We bought three coffees from each of these establishments on 23rd Street in New York City. We recorded the prices and compared the size and caffeine content of each cup. The results may surprise you. We used caffeine data from Caffeine Informer.
