But there are many more stories we need to be watching.  In its 52-page "Global Economic Outlook and Strategy" report, Citi's Willem Buiter and his team give us a sense of where the world's major economies are headed.  The economists expect the global economy to expand by 3.1% this year and by 3.4% in 2015. Citi's Michael Saunders says his team continues to cut its emerging-market growth forecasts, although "this month’s revision largely reflects a large cut to our Russia GDP forecast, reflecting heightened uncertainty and the CBR’s recent rate hike." In China, Saunders expects policymakers to react to slower growth with "renewed credit easing." Among developed economies, Citi expects higher growth from the euro area, U.K., and Sweden, but cuts Japan's growth forecast. In the U.S., Citi expects the recent winter weakness to be reversed and thinks rate hikes won't come until mid-2015. We highlight a few of the viewpoints for each of the world's most important economies, including GDP forecasts through 2018.   FREE AppDownload
