REUTERS/China Daily UK inflation ticked up to 1.3% in October, according to figures just released by the Office for National Statistics.  Analysts had expected inflation to come in at 1.3%, up from September's 1.2% reading.  The core figure, which strips out the most volatile prices, like food and tobacco, came in slightly higher at 1.5%. Despite the slight increase, with oil prices dropping, inflation will probably remain below the Bank of England's 2% target in the coming months.  FREE AppDownload
