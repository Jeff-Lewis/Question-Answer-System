Bloomberg TVLast week, following the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to refrain from tapering back its quantitative easing program, JPMorgan chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee told clients that the indication of continued easing should be enough to support stocks through the end of the year. Lee has a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 1775. Today, the index is trading around 1690, so Lee's forecast implies an additional 5% upside for stocks over the next three months. In his latest note to clients today, Lee gives three reasons why he thinks that is likely: "Investor apprehension about this market continues to increase," says Lee. "It is the combination of fears that this was a 'false breakout' to new highs coupled with lingering concerns about the budget/debt ceiling showdown in the U.S. and the possible resulting turmoil. That said, we remain constructive on equities into [year-end] and still see the S&amp;P 500 reaching at least 1775." FREE AppDownload
