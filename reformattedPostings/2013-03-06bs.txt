Courtesy of CNNEarlier today we revisited former Texas Congressman Ron Paul's precious metal-heavy portfolio.  Paul is one of the most famous advocates of gold as an investment, so we took a look at how his 64 percent precious metal portfolio was handling the recent crash in the price of gold. We took a look at the three major mining stocks that the Wall Street Journal described as the largest of Paul's holdings. Here's what has happened to them in the past six months: Looking at the twenty-one publicly listed mining companies in the Ron Paul portfolio,  the average return on investment was a dismal –22.62% over the past six months. Given that the Wall Street Journal reported that Paul's portfolio was worth between $2.44 million and $5.46 million — and that 64 percent of his assets were in these precious metal stocks — a very loose estimate is that Ron Paul has lost between $353,204 and $790,366 over the past six months, based on the average loss of his mining holdings. The moral of the story: don't just be in gold related assets. FREE AppDownload
