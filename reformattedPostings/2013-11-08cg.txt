French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici reacted by saying his country's debt remained among the safest and liquid in the world, criticizing what he said were "inaccurate criticisms" of Europe's number 2 economy. "During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances, and its competitiveness," he said in a statement. He added that French debt, which has yet to start trading, benefitted from historically low rates. Ratings agency Fitch last week upgraded the outlook on Spain's credit rating, pointing to a convergence between France - typically considered a core euro zone member - and Spain, usually described as a peripheral state.
