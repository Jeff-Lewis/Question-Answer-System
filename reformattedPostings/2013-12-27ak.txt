After a great run, Twitter is finally coming back to Earth. The stock fell 13.04% today.  There was no real catalyst for the stock's run, so investors may be profit-taking as they say. (Ugh, we know.)  This morning Ben Schachter at Macquarie downgraded the stock saying that it had gone on a crazy run while nothing fundamental changed about the business. So, he labeled it "underperform." Maybe that was the wake-up call for investors.  Who knows! Its mysterious rise is ending with a slightly less mysterious (but still mysterious) fall.              					                                                                                                                                            facebook                                                                        linkedin                                                                        twitter                                                                        google+                                                                        email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                email                                                                                        share                                                                         share                                                                         tweet                                                                         share                                                                         email                                                                                        Share on Facebook                                                                         Share on Twitter                                                                         Share on Linkedin                                                                         Share on Google Plus                                                                         email                                                            Recommended For You                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];                                    _taboola.push({mode:'thumbs-1r', container:'taboola-below-main-column', placement:'below-main-column'});                                                                                                                        Comments             Comments on this post are now closed.
