According to the complaint, one of the suspects — the complaint does not specify whether it was Dzhokhar or his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan — entered the vehicle and pointed a gun at the victim. THe New York Times reported that Tamerlan is believed to have been the initial carjacker. "Did you hear about the Boston explosion?" the carjacker asked his victim. "I did that." According to the complaint, the carjacker then removed a magazine from the gun, showed the victim that he had a bullet in it, and re-inserted the magazine. "I am serious," he said. The carjacker forced his victim to drive to another location to pick up a second man — the other suspect. The man with the gun demanded $45 from the victim, as well as his ATM card and password. The carjacking victim escaped when the two men got out of the car at a convenience store in Cambridge, Mass., according to the complaint. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged on Monday with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of malicious destruction of property with an explosive device. Tsarnaev could face the death penalty. Here's the relevant part of the complaint: Justice Department This post has been updated. FREE AppDownload
