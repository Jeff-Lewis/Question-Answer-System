A group of Harvard students took the 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test as part of a project to raise awareness about barriers to voting.  States in the South issued similar tests some 50 years ago to voters who could not "prove a fifth grade education." They had to pass all 30 questions in 10 minutes to be eligible to vote.  None of the students passed the test.  Video courtesy of Carl L Miller
