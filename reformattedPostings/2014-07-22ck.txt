REUTERS/Gary Cameron(L-R) Credit Suisse officials CEO Brady Dougan, Robert Shafir and Hans Urlich-Mesiter are sworn in before the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Investigations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington February 26, 2014. ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse reported its biggest quarterly loss since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, due to a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.78 billion) charge taken following a May settlement with U.S. authorities over tax evasion charges. The Zurich-based bank swung to a second-quarter loss of 700 million francs. A Reuters analyst poll called for a 581 million franc net loss. "I want to reiterate that we deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement and that we take full responsibility for it," Credit Suisse Chief Executive Brady Dougan said in a statement. "The continued trust and support of our clients helped us mitigate the impact of the settlement on our business."  (Reporting By Katharina Bart) FREE AppDownload
