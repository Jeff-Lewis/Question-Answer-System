We've tracked some of the top ski racers who are now working on Wall Street.  We've found folks who competed in the Olympics and others who were World Cup medalists. We found many skiers who were captains of their college teams.  We've also found some younger skiers who are heading to Wall Street when they're finished with school. These skiers have swapped running gates for putting together financial models and analyst reports. They can still hit the slopes on the weekends, though.  One of the skiers on our list happens to own a ski area, too.  If you know of other skiers who should be included, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com. Please include a photo and a brief bio of ski highlights.  FREE AppDownload
