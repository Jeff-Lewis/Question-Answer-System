Flickr/LeeLeFever Markets have a negative feel today, and once again the real pain is centered on emerging markets. India is down 2.3%, and Jakarta fell 3.4%. Thailand dropped 1.4%. The currencies of India, Turkey, and South Africa are sharply lower. Meanwhile, European markets are lower. Italy is down 0.8%, about the same amount as Germany. The weakness of emerging markets has been a big story since the Spring, and the last few weeks have been especially painful. Later today the US will get Case-Shiller home prices, as the market sits on pins and needles watching every datapoint to figure out what it means for the Fed (and more importantly the real world).
