Wikimedia CommonsThe Ukrainian hryvnia just made a new low against the U.S. dollar.  On Tuesday, one dollar bought 13.4 hyrvnias, with the hryvnia losing more than 4% against the dollar just today.  The latest drop in the currency comes amid reports that Russia is sending a convoy of 280 humanitarian aid trucks into Ukraine, according to Reuters.  This convoy comes amid warnings from Western nations that the help could be used, "as a pretext for an invasion." This chart from Google Finance shows the severe depreciation in the value of the hryvnia against the dollar over the last month. Google Finance (via @SaraEisen) FREE AppDownload
