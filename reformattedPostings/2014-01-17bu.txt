REUTERS/Yuri GripasMorgan Stanley just reported a noisy earnings beat for Q4 2013 with earnings per share of $0.50 ex tax benefits and one-time legal reserve expenses of about $1.2 billion. Analysts expected an earnings per share of $0.44. Revenue came in at $8.2 billion — analysts on average expected earnings of $8.0 billion. That's nice and all, but it's more important to note that the bank reported a profit of $181 million — down 70% from the same time last year when the bank made a profit of $594 million. Yikes. A couple things to note in this report —  trading (especially in fixed income), wealth management and compensation. On trading — last quarter banks got completely smacked in this sector, this quarter it wasn't as bad, but it wasn't pretty either. Analysts expected fixed income trading revenue to come in around $800 million, but Morgan missed on that one bringing in $694 million citing "weakness in interest rate products." Equity sales and trading fared much better, coming in at $1.5 billion compared to $1.4 billion at the same time the year before. Onto wealth management. This is key because it's the crux of Gorman's business model for the bank. So far it has served them well — it's what had Morgan beating its arch rival Goldman Sachs last quarter. Morgan Stanley made a net revenue of $3.7 billion on its wealth management business in Q4 2013, compared to $3.3 billion at the same time the year before. Compensation expense in the sector increased from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion of the same period. In fact compensation was up at Morgan Stanley in general, from $3.6 billion in Q4 2012, to $4.0 billion in 2013.
