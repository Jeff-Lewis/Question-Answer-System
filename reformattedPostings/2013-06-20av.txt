Some 150 people have died after heavy monsoon flooding in Uttarakhand, North India, according to The Indian Express. But officials believe the death toll could climb once the flood waters recede.  Many of those impacted by the flooding and landslides were visiting Kedarnath, a Hindu temple in the Himalayas. The floods that hit the North a few days ago have been dubbed the 'Himalayan Tsunami' and rescue operations are ongoing. 50,000 people in the state are believed to be stranded. Other parts of India have also been hit by heavy monsoons. The statue of a Hindu deity is submerged by flood waters of the river Ganges in Uttarakhand, India.
