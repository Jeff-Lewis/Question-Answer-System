JohnGoode / FlickrUPDATE:After a nice early start, markets in Europe have erased gains, and now they're tumbling. Germany's Dax is down 0.3%. Spain's IBEX is down 0.7%. France's CAC 40 is down 0.6%. ORIGINAL (4:13 AM ET): Stock markets are staging a nice rally early in the European trading session, following a 99 point rally in the Dow Jones Industrials and a 3.7 percent surge in Japan's Nikkei. England's FTSE 100 is up 0.5%. Germany's Dax is up 0.2%. Spain's IBEX is up 0.4%. France's CAC 40 is up 0.2%. It's a particularly quiet day today with no major U.S. economic news being announced.  Later this morning we'll get a German bond auction. Tomorrow should be more interesting with an ECB meeting, initial jobless claims in the U.S., and the grilling of incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney.
