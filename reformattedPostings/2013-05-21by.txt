How are we doing? Not so good recently. S&amp;P 500 revenues fell during Q1, and are up only 1.4% y/y. This series is highly correlated with the 12-month sum of the value of world exports, which has been flat for the past year. A somewhat more encouraging indicator is 52-week forward consensus expected revenues for the S&amp;P 500--the time-weighted average of analysts’ estimates for the current and the coming year. It remains on an uptrend, though it dipped during the Q1-2013 earnings season as analysts lowered their expectations for 2013 revenues because of all the negative revenue surprises. The revenue disappointments were relatively widespread, with only three of the 10 S&amp;P 500 showing modest q/q gains: Energy, Materials, and Utilities. Here is the y/y performance derby for Q1’s revenues: Consumer Discretionary (7.0% y/y), Financials (4.4), Telecom (4.1), Tech (3.8), Health Care (2.7), Consumer Staples (2.6), Materials (1.5), S&amp;P 500 (1.4), Utilities (1.3), Industrials (0.3), and Energy (-7.6).
