APDave Lutz of Stifel Nicolaus passes along what he's chattering about this morning. Good Morning! US Futures are weaker this AM, with the S&amp;P off 40bp. While the stronger Yen is a factor - 2 market headwinds this week is Yellen speaking before Congress Tuesday and Thurs (uncertainty) and the Retail Sales Print for January due Thursday (Bad Weather) ahead of a 3day weekend in the States. We also have some overnight weakness in EM, with Ukraine and Hungary’s FX under pressure. The DAX just turned negative, while EU’s Financials are off 1.2% ahead of a Noon Trichet speech in Athens. Volumes in the EU are pacing very light, with Germany trading 40% below the 20day average – EU’s VIX is up 2%, but has lost 20% over the last 5 sessions. The Nikkei gained almost 2%, but the Yen gapped higher at 2amET after a BOJ Corporate Bond Buying Operation – Nikkei futures are off 1% right now. China’s market ripped higher on headlines showing strong spending over their New Years Holiday – and Electric carmakers jumped as China’s finance ministry cut subsidies by a smaller amount than previously announced, and extended incentives through 2015.

We have a bid under Industrial metals on the China headlines, with Silver jumping 1.2% and copper slightly higher. Gold has added 75bp, breaking upside of the 100dma and hitting the highest levels since early November (Record Chinese Consumption). The Oil complex is under slight pressure, with WTI retreating 40bp to test the 200dma, on headlines of increased Libya output ahead of OPEC’s monthly report later this week.
