BTC KeychainBitcoin prices are up more than 5% as it appears sales of the government's Bitcoin stash produced some bullish results. The U.S. Marshals service has not yet released the official results. But Barry Silbert, whose SecondMarket put together a syndicate of 42 bidders, just said they were all outbid. The auction was unlikely to have gone any other way, given that we are talking about a collection of wealthy Bitcoin bulls getting the chance to bid each-other up in a totally controlled environment. Still, assuming the nearly 30,000 coins the government was auctioning go for a premium, it'll make for some good headlines.  Coindesk FREE AppDownload
