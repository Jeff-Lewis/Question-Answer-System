Art Cashin, UBS's veteran NYSE trader and indisputable Wall Street legend, has a couple of traditions. Among his more popular traditions are his year-end poems, wrapping up highlights from the year. Cashin just circulated his latest: 'Tis two days yet to New Year but despite what you’re hopin’ The folks in the Board Room say “the full Eve we'll stay open”   So we'll buy and we'll sell as the tape crawls along And though "Bubbly's" verboten we may still sing a song   Two Thousand Thirteen had some spots of high hopes They may get fumbled away by those Washington dopes   A brief government shutdown pushed sides further apart Let’s all hope things improve as the New Year we start   "If you like it you can keep it" we heard the President quip When that didn’t work out in the polls he did slip   We lost special people as we seem to each year It just makes us treasure each one that’s still here   Mandela and Thatcher they reshaped their times They’ll now regale the angels backed by heavenly chimes   And Peter O’Toole with his steely blue eyes Joined the great Joan Fontaine in God’s still bluer skies   Jean Stapleton’s “Edith” has joined Archie on high And author Tom Clancy chose October to die   Ed Koch now asks angels his set quote, “How’m I doin” Gone is Hugo Chavez who brought his nation to ruin   Helen Thomas asks questions of St. Peter these days Also Frank Lautenberg left his senator’s ways   Jim Hall, jazz guitarist, played his final great note Richie Havens, quite different is now in the same boat   Ray Harryhausen, who created creatures unreal Joined Jonathan Winters every scene he would steal   Van Cliburn’s piano angels hear without faults As Patti Page sings them the old Tennessee Waltz   And Frost re-met Nixon midst the clouds they’ll debate While Tony Soprano while in Rome met his fate   Scott Carpenter and angels now together will sup Roger Ebert gave the harp a quite hearty thumbs up   Esther Williams swam off Eydie Gorme took a bow And Annette Funicello has joined them both now   And Doctor Joyce Brothers bid her clients goodbye While “Dear Abby” Van Buren gives advice from on high   In Boston, two brothers put some bombs in a crowd Although hundreds were injured that great town stayed unbowed   Wild fires aplenty burned in state after state Elsewhere came tornadoes seems Mother Nature’s irate   The Philippines saw a cyclone winds of 200 miles Caused immense devastation to those once lovely isles   A Bangladesh building did collapse in the spring Though a thousand folks died few reforms did it bring   In Syria, chemicals wiped out a whole town In a mall in Nairobi scores of folks were mowed down   FOMO is a slogan it’s “fear of missing out” Now we’re all self-absorbed that’s what that’s all about   Wall Street saw stocks soar but Main Street stayed slow As the Fed starts to taper we’ll see just how things go   Jeff Bezos announced a new delivery drone Edward Snowden revealed that we’d tapped Merkel’s phone   Prince George did arrive of pictures there was no lack and sweet tooths were quite pleased to see Twinkies come back   Paula Deen fell from grace for some things she once said The Duck Dynasty guy made some people turn red   Former Hannah Montana shocked some fans with a twerk In Toronto the mayor some folks called a jerk   Let not this year's memories of sadness or sleaze Disturb you this day just give your heart ease   Have faith that this New Year will bring a new sign And believe in yourself it will all work out fine   Just lift up your spirits and some fruit of the vine And kiss ye a loved one and sing Auld Lange Syne   And late Tuesday evening as you watch the ball fall Wish yourself all the best Happy New Year to All!!
