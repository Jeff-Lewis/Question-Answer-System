JCPenney has spent billions of dollars remodeling its stores into modern boutiques.  While most stores are still under construction, Wall Street analyst Brian Sozzi took a quick video inside a Long Island JCPenney with completed stores.  The result looks great: modern, clean, and chic.  Sozzi uploaded the video to the website of his firm, Belus Capital.  Check out the new shop-in-shops here:   FREE AppDownload
