In the week ended September 18, we saw the biggest push into stock market mutual funds and ETFs on record. Investors poured $25.9 billion into global equity funds in the past week, "driven by massive ETF inflows to SPY, IWM, EEM, GDX," says BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who describes the inflows as "big pre-FOMC short-covering." Meanwhile, bond funds continued to see outflows — to the tune of $1.1 billion this week. Below is a complete breakdown of this week's fund flows, via Hartnett: Asset Class Flows Equities: record $25.9bn inflows ($24bn via ETF's - SPY, IWM, EEM, GDX) Bonds: $1.1bn outflows (8 straight weeks) Commodities: $0.2bn outflows (ends 4 straight weeks of inflows) Equity Flows EM: $1.5bn inflows; note big inflows to Korea ($0.6bn) and GEM funds ($1.0bn).
