On Friday, we learned U.S. companies added 192,000 nonfarm payrolls in March, which was a bit below Wall Street's forecast for 200,000. February's number, however, was revised up to 197,000 from a prior estimate of 175,000. It's worth adding that  total nonfarm private payrolls stands at 116,067,000, which is an all-time high.

Facebook is among the names that are down more than 20%. "All I'll say is that you'd think investors would've learned from the tech bubble and housing bubble, but I guess they were just dying to touch the hot stove once again," said Rich Bernstein in a recent email to Business Insider. "Now they're getting burned." Because valuations still remain high in these momentum stocks, experts see this correction continuing. However, the market strategists seem to agree that this is good news as it brings more balance to stock market valuations. For more insight about the middle market, visit mid-marketpulse.com.
