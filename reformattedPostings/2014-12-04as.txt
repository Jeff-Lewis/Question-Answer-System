Stack Commerce Every home should have a great sound system, and bonus points if it looks great, too. This is the first levitating Bluetooth speaker. It looks kind of like the Death Star with a brushed steel and chrome finish, and packs a punch in terms of sound: a full, crisp, clear 105 decibels.  The speaker, which was designed by a team out of Oakland, California, uses magnetic levitation to get the speaker to float about an inch off of the base, and it spins while it plays. It even has a microphone, so you can use it to take calls.  You can grab it here with a discount thanks to Insider Picks and our friends at Stack Commerce.
