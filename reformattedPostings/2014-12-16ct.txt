Thomson ReutersA Wall Street sign outside the New York Stock ExchangeNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday as a slide in the Russian rouble and crude oil prices sent traders fleeing risky assets. The rouble  lost more than 17 percent against the U.S. dollar even after Moscow's central bank hiked its main interest rate to 17 percent from 10.5 percent. Brent crude  lost nearly 4 percent after hitting a low of $58.50 and U.S. crude  was down 3 percent at $54.21 after hitting $53.80. Adding to global concerns, data showed factory activity shrinking in China and euro zone business growth remaining weak. Plunging oil prices could heighten geopolitical tensions, trigger defaults by U.S. shale oil and gas firms and destabilize euro zone inflation expectations, the Bank of England warned on Tuesday. U.S. data due later in the day include housing starts for November and Markit's gauge of growth in the manufacturing sector.
