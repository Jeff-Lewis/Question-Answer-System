bytemarks / FlickrThe Department of Labor's latest report on weekly unemployment insurance claims is out. Claims dropped to 323,000 from 332,000 a week ago. Economists were looking for a reading of 330,000. "[T]he fact that jobless claims have been consistently below 350k—a key level that has been commensurate with 200kplusnonfarm payroll growth in the past—bodes well for Friday’s report," said Deutsche Bank's Brett Ryan in a note before the release. Today's number was just a hair about 322,000, the level reached three weeks ago, which was also the lowest level since January 2008. The four-week moving average has fallen to 328,500, down from 331,500 a week ago. This is the lowest level since October 2007. FREE AppDownload
