REUTERS/ Robert GalbraithJanet Yellen, vice chair of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.BofA Merrill Lynch is advising clients to buy Treasury securities. "We recommend a tactical long on the [5-year] note to position for a [10 to 15 basis point] decline in rates over the coming weeks," write BofA interest rate strategists Priya Misra and Shyam Rajan and technical strategist MacNeil Curry in a note to clients. "A combination of headline risks around the continuing resolution, dovish Fed speak, a possible Yellen nomination compounded by short positioning and technicals in the market could lead us lower in yields over the coming two weeks. Note that this is a tactical trade and we still maintain our view of rates heading higher by year end." The strategists initiated the trade at a 1.45% yield on the 5-year Treasury note, targeting 1.3%. (Right now, the 5-year yield is at 1.42%.) Misra, Rajan, and Curry expand on the five drivers of the trade: Of course, there are risks that could derail the trade, as Misra, Rajan, and Curry admit. "Stronger than expected data and relatively benign fiscal negotiations are risks to this trade," they write. "However, the underpinning of a fragile recovery and a dovish Fed that is in no hurry to taper lead us to believe that the risks to a sharp rise in rates in the coming weeks is small."
