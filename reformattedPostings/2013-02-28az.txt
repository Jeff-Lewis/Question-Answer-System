The average price of gas in February was $3.65 per gallon, 10 cents higher than the previous record for the month set just last year. Today’s national average of $3.782 per gallon is five cents higher than the average a year ago. We've also set a record for fastest price increase. We started out the year at $3.29 per gallon, and have climbed to a national average of $3.78 per gallon. The previous record through the end of February was a rise of 46 cents per gallon in 2012. We recently explained why all this is happening — it's a combination of refinery outages and international demand. We also told you why all of America's new crude production won't lower gas prices — there's not enough domestic infrastructure to transport it, and there's too much international competition for product.   The lone silver lining is that AAA believes the record ramp-up could mean prices peak lower than they otherwise would.
