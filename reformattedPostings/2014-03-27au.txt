BIIThe recent decision by the IRS to deem Bitcoin as property and tax it in the mode of stocks, rather than treating it as currency, is going to create a lot more uncertainty for Bitcoin in the short-term. The drumbeat for more clarity and regulation is getting louder in the face of the decision. At BI Intelligence, we believe Bitcoin's real value is as a payments network. Bitcoin offers merchants and individuals an extremely low-cost, virtually frictionless payments system. Value can easily be transferred around the world without transmitting sensitive information that could be used for fraud, and without forcing merchants to pay exorbitant transaction fees. But as the IRS decision makes clear, the digital currency still faces stiff hurdles, not least of which are regulatory.  In  a recent report from BI Intelligence, we explain how Bitcoin works, from the moment when local currency is exchanged for bitcoins, to the moment when it reaches the electronic wallet of a receiving party. We look at the key advantages of Bitcoin compared to the legacy players in the payments industry and examine the challenges that Bitcoin faces as a payment network.  Access the Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today &gt;&gt; Here are some of the key elements from the report:  In full, the report: For full access to all BI Intelligence's charts and data on the Payments Industry, sign up for a free trial.   FREE AppDownload
