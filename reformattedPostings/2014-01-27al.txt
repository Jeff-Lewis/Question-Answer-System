Reuters/ Brendan McDermidBill Stiritz, the CEO/chairman of Post Holdings, is the largest individual shareholder of Herbalife stock.Shares of Herbalife spiked today on news that the stock's most bullish analyst was leaving his firm.  According to Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino, D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey is leaving his firm.  According to Gasparino, he's possibly headed to join forces with Bill Stiritz.  CNBC's Scott Wapner reported that Ramey sent a letter out today that said he's going to do "some consulting on strategy, M&amp;A, and corporate development for a significant company working with executives where I have had a long and productive relationship."  Ramey is known for being super bullish and incredibly vocal on Herbalife. When Business Insider reached Ramey on his phone he said, "No comment."  Stiritz, 77, is the CEO/chairman of food company Post Holdings. He's also the largest individual shareholder of Herbalife.  It's been reported that he wants to help Herbalife undergo a leveraged buyout (LBO).   Herbalife is a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional products like weightloss shakes and supplements.   It's the company that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is massively short.  Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, believes the company operates as an illegal "pyramid scheme."  He publicly declared in December 2012 that he's short about 20 million shares of Herbalife with a price target of $0.  In other words, he thinks the company will be shut down by regulators.  A bunch of other fund managers, including Ackman's rival Carl Icahn, have disagreed with Ackman and have gone long the stock.   Last week, shares of Herbalife fell about 12% on news that a senator from Massachusetts had sent letters to the FTC and SEC asking that they investigate the nutrition company.
