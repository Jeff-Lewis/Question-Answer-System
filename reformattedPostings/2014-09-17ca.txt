REUTERS/Toussaint KluitersHomebuilder confidence is high in America. The NAHB housing market index jumped to 59 in September from 55 in August. This was stronger than the 56 expected by economists. It was also the highest reading since November 2005. "Since early summer, builders in many markets across the nation have been reporting that buyer interest and traffic have picked up, which is a positive sign that the housing market is moving in the right direction," the NAHB's Kevin Kelly said. The index of future sales increased two points to 67. "History suggests that the index of future single-family sales is a reasonable gauge of start activity six months ahead," Barclays' Michael Gapen said. "We view this report as consistent with our outlook that improved sentiment should support start activity in the coming quarters." “While a firming job market is helping to unleash pent-up demand for new homes and contributing to a gradual, upward trend in builder confidence, we are still not seeing much activity from first-time home buyers,” NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe noted. “Other factors impeding the pace of the housing recovery include persistently tight credit conditions for consumers and rising costs for materials, lots and labor.” FREE AppDownload
