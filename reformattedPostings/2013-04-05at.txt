Getty Images/ Patrick McDermottWall Street firms have a habit of hiring lacrosse players.  Bloomberg Businessweek published a piece last year about the "lacrosse mafia" linking several Wall Street execs to the sport. We decided to comb through Major League Lacrosse rosters and find the best players at Wall Street firms. Since MLL has only been around since 1998, we have included some players who were standouts that never had the chance to join a pro team. We have also included a member of the women's U.S. world cup gold medal-winning team who works in finance. Many of the players on our list play professionally while working full-time finance jobs.  Some have retired from the sport and others have left the Street. If we're missing any big names, feel free to send us an email at jlaroche@businessinsider.com to add to the list.  FREE AppDownload
