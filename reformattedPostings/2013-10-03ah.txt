Twitter's IPO filing is out. There are no really big surprises in it.  The company is on track to do over $500 million in revenue this year, though it's losing money.  It has 218 million monthly active users, of which 75% use Twitter on a mobile device. It says that less than 5% of accounts are spam.  Its 218 million monthly active users is relatively small. Facebook has over 1 billion, for comparison. Twitter says in the filing, "We believe that there is a significant opportunity to expand our user base. Industry sources estimate that as of 2012 there were 2.4 billion Internet users and 1.2 billion smartphone users, of which only 215 million are monthly active users of Twitter." The company plans to trade under the ticker "TWTR".  It wants to raise $1 billion through its IPO.  Through six months of this year revenue is $253.6 million, up from $122.4 million a year ago. Over the same period its net loss is $69 million, which compares to a loss of $49 million last year. It currently has $164.5 million in cash on hand, and it is cash flow negative. It burned $38 million in the last six months.  Here are all the high level financial details: SEC FREE AppDownload
