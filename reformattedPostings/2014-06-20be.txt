BII The outlines of an iPhone-centered mobile payment system are beginning to emerge. There are plenty of reasons why Apple could be successful in payments — starting with their 800 million iTunes customer accounts, most of them already associated with a credit card number (see chart, above) — but the expected iPhone 6 launch late this summer or autumn has created expectations of new payments-related phone features.  At BI Intelligence, Business Insider's subscription research service, we published a research note on where Apple is with mobile payments, and where we think it's headed. The full note and data is only available to BI Intelligence members.  WE BELIEVE APPLE'S MOBILE PAYMENTS SYSTEM WILL REST ON THREE BASIC COMPONENTS:  This system would be easy to use, relatively simple for merchants to adopt, and secure. All the ingredients are in place, but technical and other important barriers to adoption remain. It is still an open question too whether consumers will be ready for a truly frictionless experience that dispenses with the checkout altogether. BII FREE AppDownload
