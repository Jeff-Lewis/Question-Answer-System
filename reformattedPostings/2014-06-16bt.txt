REUTERS/Bogdan CristelParticipants run in high-heels during the warm-up of the Stiletto Run in Bucharest June 14, 2014.The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss and decide the path of monetary policy. This comes in the wake of improving economic data. "The committee is likely to make some upgrades to its description of the economic outlook in the post-meeting statement and its economic projections," said Goldman Sachs' Jari Stehn. "Although the committee will need to reduce its 2014 real GDP growth forecast to take into account the Q1 disappointment, we would expect the committee to reduce its unemployment rate forecast and lift its inflation forecast slightly." Meanwhile, traders have escalating turmoil in Iraq to contend with. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary The VIX, or the CBOE volatility index, is the center of lots of debate and confusion. Even with the recent turmoil in Iraq, the VIX remains at depressed levels, which some interpret to be a sign of investor complacency. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco believes that market watchers should consider the VIX relative to valuation ratios like price-earnings (PE). From Bianco: "We define 5 categories of market emotion gauged by PE/VIX: 1) Crash - very high VIX and low PE, 2) Skeptical/Denial - VIX elevated and PE still low, 3) Realistic/Disciplined – Both PE and VIX within normal ranges, 4) Complacency – low VIX or high PE or both, 5) Mania – very high PE and low VIX. PE/VIX is 1.3 and suggests market complacency. It has entered the 2004-2007 range. On Jun 10, PE/VIX reaches 1.6 with trailing PE of 17.5 and a very low VIX of 11."
