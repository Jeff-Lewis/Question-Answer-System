REUTERS/Brian Snyder(Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, one of the U.S. central bank's most ardent policy hawks, will retire on March 19, the regional Fed bank said on Thursday. The bank's board of directors has hired Heidrick &amp; Struggles to conduct a search for his replacement. Fisher, 65, is required by Fed rules to retire by next April. He is a voter on policy this year, but will not vote next year.   (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) FREE AppDownload
