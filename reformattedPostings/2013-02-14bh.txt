Getco, the high frequency trading firm that bought Knight Capital last year, reported earnings for the first time yesterday, and it was total carnage.

Revenue decreased 41 percent to $425.3 million. Getco agreed to buy Knight in a $1.4 billion deal after the market maker lost more than $450 million when computers generated a flood of erroneous orders in August. Just, ugly.
