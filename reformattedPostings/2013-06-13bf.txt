Yesterday we participated in the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge 3.6 mile run in Central Park with thousands of other runners from investment banks, hedge funds and other companies in New York City.  As we were heading over to the start line, we ran into a small group representing Lehman Brothers—the investment banking giant that collapsed in September 2008. They were wearing gray t-shirts with Frankeinstein's monster on the back and the saying "We're Alive!."  Perhaps another t-shirt slogan option could have been Dick Fuld's quote, "the BRos always wins!!"  The company still operates in midtown Manhattan with far fewer people selling off its remaining assets, according to Reuters.  Check out the shirts:  Julia La Roche for Business Insider FREE AppDownload
