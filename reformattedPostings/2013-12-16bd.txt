With three Michelin stars under his belt at the relatively young age of 58, Danie Boulud has captured the attention and respect of foodies across the globe. And in a recent interview with The Independant, Boulud had his say about one of the most controversial debates rocking the world of meat right now — how long should dry aged steak be aged? In New York City — where Boulud's restaurant, Daniel, has reigned over the Upper East Side for years — some restaurants are aging their steaks up to 125 days (like Osteria Morini) or 140 days (like Eleven Madison Park). That's extreme, and a solid 44 days is more common, but Boulud says even that's too much for him. From The Independent: He’s so approachable, you end up asking him slightly silly, while-I’ve-got-you-here questions: does he believe in hanging meat for (the new fashion) 44 days? “Non, I don’t like that – you can’t do it with grass-fed meat, because it would be like that” – he bangs the table twice – “there would be no fat left in it. For me, 30 days it’s already pretty good for rib eye or sirloin on the bone. I like my meat grass-fed and juicy. The French never age their meat more than two or three weeks.” Read the full profile here&gt; FREE AppDownload
