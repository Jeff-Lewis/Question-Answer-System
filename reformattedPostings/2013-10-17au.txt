Bloomberg TVEvery city worth its salt needs a money honey  (or two) to keep the daily discussion on finance going. In London, that's Bloomberg TV's Francine Lacqua's job. Lacqua, an editor-at-large, hosts "On the Move with Francine Lacqua," which hits the airwaves across Europe when the market opens. That means, naturally, that she's covers everything from the French and Italian elections to Davos to G20 meetings. Lacqua also hosts, "Eye to Eye," a special series where she sits down with businessmen and top CEOs on London's Eye. You know, usual anchor stuff. FREE AppDownload
