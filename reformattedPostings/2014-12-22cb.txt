On Monday, the Central Bank of Russia announced that it will be bailing out the first bank of the current ruble crisis, the private lender Trust Bank. The central bank will provide 30 billion rubles — roughly $530 million — but did not officially say that Trust Bank's problems were linked to the ruble's plunge. Additionally, the CBR stated that its Deposit Insurance Agency would take over supervision of Trust Bank as of Monday. Over the past year, the ruble has dropped by 45% against the dollar, and last week was particularly brutal for the currency. But here's the real story: Bruce Willis is the face of Trust Bank.
