REUTERS/Beawiharta Paul Polman has joined Unilever as CEO in 2009. He previously worked for Nestlé as CFO.Unilever said a "sharp" slowdown in China has weighed on sales as it reported a weaker-than-expected 2.1pc increase in third-quarter sales. The consumer goods giant said sales in China fell 20pc after retailers lowered stock levels in the face of lower demand. That dragged on global sales growth, which increased by 2.1pc to €12.2bn. Paul Polman, Unilever's chief executive, said : "Market growth slowed in emerging countries and particularly in China where we also experienced substantial trade de-stocking. Europe saw price deflation and poor summer weather compared with last year but conditions in North America started to improve." The weaker sales performance fell some way short of analysts' expectations for third-quarter sales growth of 3.7pc. The PG Tips and Dove soap maker said sales volume, measuring the amount of products sold, rose only 0.3pc, while analysts expected growth of 1.8pc. "Macro-economic conditions continued to put pressure on consumers," Mr Polman said in a statement. Nevertheless, the chief executive added that the company was confident it will achieve "another year of profitable volume growth ahead of our markets". FREE AppDownload
