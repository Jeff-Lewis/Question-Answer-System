The Sohn Investment Conference is a serious affair. It attracts the brightest minds  and best ideas in the world of value investing for a great cause — pediatric cancer research (check out their site here). But hey, the conference is still a day when people get to get out of the office and meet their peers, so there's got to be some fun. At least, we had a good time.
