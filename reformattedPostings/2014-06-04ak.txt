All 12 Federal Reserve districts saw economic activity expand in May, with the pace of growth climbing most around Cleveland and St. Louis. Activity around St. Louis slowed, according to the latest edition of the Fed's beige book. Retail sales grew at a moderate pace across most of the country, the Fed said, although lingering wintry weather weighed on retail activity in the Northeast.
