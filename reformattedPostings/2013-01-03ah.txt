These extraordinary declines weren't triggered by any improvement in the sorry state of state finances in the euro zone. Rather, they started when ECB President Mario Draghi declared in late July of last year that he would do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro, including buying the sovereign notes of euro zone governments. So far, the ECB hasn’t had to do much to back up Draghi’s declaration. His willingness to implement unlimited “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) has worked wonders. Draghi’s fairy dust also stopped the massive capital outflows out of Spain and Italy into Germany, as evidenced by the flattening of TARGET2 balances since last summer. Among the best-performing stock markets last year were the ones in the euro zone: Greece (33.4%), Germany (29.2), Ireland (17.1), and France (15.2). So far, the rally in European stock prices hasn’t been validated by the region’s economic indicators with a couple of important exceptions. As Debbie discusses below, the euro zone’s manufacturing PMI index was 46.1 during December, little changed from November and well below 50. On the other hand, the M-PMI for the UK jumped to 51.4 last month from 49.2 during November and 47.9 in October. In addition, Germany’s Ifo business confidence index rebounded from 100.0 during October to 102.4 during December. Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Live to Die Another Day?
