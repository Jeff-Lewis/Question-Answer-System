Mike Nudelman/Business Insider The White House made it official 15 minutes early: The federal government shut down for the first time in 17 years at midnight on Tuesday.  At 11:45 p.m. ET on Monday, the Office of Management and Budget offered guidance for federal agencies to begin preparations for a partial government shutdown.  "Unfortunately, we do not have a clear indication that Congress will act in time for the President to sign a continuing resolution before the end of the day tomorrow, October 1, 2013," OMB Director Sylvia Burwell wrote.  "We urge Congress to act quickly to pass a Continuing Resolution to provide a short-term bridge that ensures sufficient time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year, and to restore the operation of critical public services and programs that will be impacted by a lapse in appropriations." The White House's move came after a night of continued ping-pong between the House and Senate failed to produce a bill that avoided a shutdown.  A brief rundown of what has transpired over the past 10 days: The full OMB memo is below: OMB shutdown memo  FREE AppDownload
