Harvard University has produced nearly twice as many billionaire alumni as any other institution of higher education, according to the 2013 Billionaire Census from Wealth-X and UBS. Its 52 billionaire alumni are worth $205 billion, compared to second-place University of Pennsylvania's 28 billionaire graduates, who together are worth $112 billion. The University of Cambridge was the only non-U.S. university to break into the top 10, with 11 billionaire alumni. According to Wealth-X and UBS, 68% of billionaires have at least a bachelor's degree. In comparison, 86% of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (those with a net worth of $30 million or more) have a bachelor's degree or higher. "These figures suggest that while  education may help a person become a  UHNW individual, it is not a prerequisite  to then go on and amass a billion dollar fortune," the report concluded.
