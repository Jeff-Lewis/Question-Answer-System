Mike Powell/Getty ImagesThe results of the July Chicago PMI survey are out. The headline index rose to 52.3 from last month's 51.6 reading, failing to reach the 54.0 level predicted by economists. The index has been volatile recently. The index surged to 58.7 in May from 49.0 before falling back down to 51.6 in June. Below is the full text of the release: The Chicago Business Barometer increased to 52.3 in July from 51.6 in June, led by gains in Order Backlogs and Supplier Deliveries, more than offsetting a second consecutive monthly decline in both Production and New Orders. While still in contraction, Order Backlogs rose in July following a record plunge in June but remain below the average seen over the past year. Supplier delivery times moved back above 50 in July having fallen to a four year low in June. The remaining three Business Activity measures which make up the Barometer fell between June and July. Production and New Orders declined to the lowest since April, while Employment eased slightly, but remained above the long-run average. Inventories continued to contract and were at their lowest since November 2009. Prices Paid rose for the third consecutive month to the highest since late 2012.
