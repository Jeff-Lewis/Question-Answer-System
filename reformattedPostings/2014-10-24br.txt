FTClick to enlarge.The European Union on Friday released new calculations on the contributions to its budget by member states. Payments are linked to a percentage of GDP, which changes over time, hence the recalculation. As the FT reported, the UK has been hit worst by the new provisional calculations as its economic growth spurt has left the country facing a bill of €2.1 billion ($2.7 billion) to be paid by December. Elsewhere, sluggish growth in France and Germany will see them receive sizeable rebates of €1 billion and €780 million respectively, while austerity-battered Greece is being asked to pay an extra €90 million. Although British policymakers will have expected an adjustment, the news comes at a particularly sensitive time, with the anti-EU UK Independence Party gaining ground in the country. Prime Minister David Cameron faces an uphill battle to avoid a second humiliating defeat to UKIP in as many months in a by-election next month in Rochester and Strood. Cameron's Conservative Party trails 13 points in the polls despite his promise to "throw everything we have" at the campaign. Receiving a huge bill from Europe less than a month before the vote will do nothing to help his chances. At a press conference Friday the Prime Minister said: "I am not paying that bill on the first of December. If people think I am going to, they have got another thing coming." FREE AppDownload
