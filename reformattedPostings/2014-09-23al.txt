Bloomberg TVTom Lee.The Wall Street strategist Tom Lee has been telling clients to "stay bullish into the year-end." "We see upside in markets broadly into year-end as result of: (i) a strengthening economy; (ii) 'beta' chase as 2014 has been one of the worst years for fund manager performance so far, and (iii) seasonal factors," he writes. In a new 39-page research note, Lee identifies 10 stocks that he believes investors should hold into the end of the year.  Lee, now head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said these 10 stocks are "Value-Momentum." "Since the start of 2014, we believe a regime shift is taking place that favors 'Value' over 'Growth' in the next few years," Lee said. "As the pace of economic growth improves, growth is less scarce hence, investors are likely not to pay up for it." FREE AppDownload
