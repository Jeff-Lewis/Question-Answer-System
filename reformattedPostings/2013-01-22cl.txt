But markets have mostly been disappointed. We already gave you the explanation from SocGen's Kit Juckes. Here's Nomura's Shuichi Obata on the same: Although the introduction of an inflation target was in line with market expectations, the markets are likely to have been disappointed by the details of the open-ended asset purchasing program, namely that: (1) it only starts in 2014; (2) monthly purchases will be offset by redemptions, such that net growth in the asset purchasing program is likely to be only around ¥10trn by end-2014; and (3) the BOJ does not envision any net growth in the size of the asset purchasing program from 2015.
