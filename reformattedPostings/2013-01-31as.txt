This question, along with a picture of a disapproving boy, has been posed to people around the world through advertisements in The Economist and other publications and with posters in airports and videos on YouTube. Another ad in the campaign suggests that your father-in-law will disapprovingly ask the same question. So? Should you invest in Eastern Poland? The Internet seems to think this is a ridiculous idea. After a flurry of mockery when the campaign was announced in September, it has become a meme with dozens of variations appearing on comedy site Something Awful. That said, the kid could be right. Poland outperformed its neighbors during the crisis, and its future looks even brighter. The central European country was named one of the best emerging markets in the world, according to Bloomberg Markets Magazine, with 21 percent GDP growth projected from 2013 to 2017.
