JCPenney CEO Ron Johnson acted like he was buds with Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren, while he really was preparing a ruthless business move, according to emails revealed in court.  After the newly-appointed Johnson revealed his turnaround plans to Wall Street last year, Lundgren wrote to congratulate him.  “Thank you, Terry. Your note means a ton to me,” Johnson replied in an email written January 27, 2012, according to the New York Post. “I consider you a friend.” "At the same time, however, Johnson was trading snarky e-mails with colleagues about Macy’s—including one in which the former Apple exec said Macy’s management 'look asleep at the wheel," the Post reported.  JCPenney was also plotting to start a line with Martha Stewart, one of Macy's most important designers.  Johnson was plotting a harsh offensive against Macy's at the time, according to emails revealed in court yesterday and reported by Women's Wear Daily:   WWD Twitter  Executives began testifying yesterday in Manhattan's New York State Court in the dispute over Martha Stewart's planned line with JCPenney.  She's had a housewares line with competitor Macy's since 2007, and executives say her agreement with them was exclusive.  Johnson isn't the only friend-turned-foe for Lundgren.  He also said that he considered Stewart to be a friend before she went behind his back and made a deal with JCPenney.  Johnson will testify Friday, while Stewart is scheduled to appear sometime next week.  FREE AppDownload
