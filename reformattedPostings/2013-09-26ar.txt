APRepublicans asked for so many of the party's priorities in a bill to raise the debt ceiling that the White House is surprised they didn't attach a "birther bill." "The only thing I didn’t see on it was a birther bill attached to it," Carney told reporters Thursday at the White House press briefing, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the controversy that first popped up in 2011 over questions about President Barack Obama's birthplace. House Republican leadership said Thursday that it will move a bill to raise the debt ceiling that contains a laundry list of conservative wishes, complicating prospects for a deal before an Oct. 17 deadline. Carney rejected those items, which include:  Carney also reiterated the Obama administration's position, which is that the President won't negotiate over raising the debt ceiling. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew set a firm, drop-dead date of Oct. 17 for Congress to raise the nation's debt limit or risk default."The debt ceiling has to be raised," Carney said Thursday. "It is not a concession to anybody to do that. It is not a concession to Republicans to do their constitutionally mandated job." He also accused Republicans of "holding the American people hostage."
