BIIA digital advertising group called ThinkLA was kind enough to ask me to speak at a massive event in Los Angeles yesterday. (Same stage as the Golden Globes!) The topic was an overview of the mobile industry. Analyst Tony Danova and the BI Intelligence team put together an excellent deck for the event, using data from the BI Intelligence archive. A link to the deck is below. Hope you enjoy it. BI Intelligence is a research and analysis service focused on mobile computing, digital media, payments, and e-commerce. BII members can download the PowerPoint and PDF versions of this deck, and download all the charts and data in Excel. Please sign up for a free trial here.
