It says there were 10 million pre-orders through China's three biggest carriers, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. There were 9.5 million orders through JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce site.  As with all things China, take these numbers with a grain of salt. These are reports of reports being translated, who knows. (If pre-orders are this big, we'd almost expect an announcement from Apple.) If these numbers are accurate, they're massive. When Apple started pre-orders of the two iPhone 6 phones in the U.S. and elsewhere, it did 4 million during the opening weekend. And its opening weekend sales were 10 million. Analysts are expecting Apple to sell ~59 million iPhones during the fourth quarter of the year. If these China orders are fulfilled, Apple will have knocked out roughly 1/3 of expectations in one weekend.  FREE AppDownload
