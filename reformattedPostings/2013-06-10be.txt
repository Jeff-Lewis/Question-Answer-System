Getty ImagesDavid Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist, provides us with a list of stocks with the most upside potential in his new Monthly Chartbook. Kostin notes early May was solid for the S&amp;P 500, but cited month-end drags in telecom services and utilities (-7 and -9 percent, respectively).  Nevertheless, he projects the S&amp;P will end up 7.3% by year end, at 1750. Like last time, the list of undervalued stocks is dominated by the energy industry. You'll find some healthcare and tech picks in there too. FREE AppDownload
