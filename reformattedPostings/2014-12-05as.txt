APHoliday party dress codes are hard to decipher. There's a fine line between festive and completely inappropriate. But don't worry — we've come up with a quick guide so that you don't embarrass yourself in front of your boss. You're welcome. Stick with a navy jacket for holiday shindigs. They're classic and professional — and can be re-worn for practically any occasion. We recommend that you avoid black — it's too harsh.

A plain white shirt is another safe bet — you basically can't go wrong as long as there aren't huge stains on it.  Saks Fifth AvenueIke Behar Crosby Striped Dress ShirtIke Behar Crosby Striped Dress ShirtPrice: $135.00   Eton of Sweden Slim-Fit Solid Twill Dress ShirtPrice: $240.00 For pants, you'll want to wear gray flannel.  NordstromNordstrom Classic Fit Navy Wool BlazerNordstrom Classic Fit Navy Wool Blazer — 33% OFF Price: $145.00 $97.15  Flat Front Wool Flannel TrousersPrice: $125.00 For a holiday tie, if the event is on the conservative end, a nice blue tie is the way to go.
