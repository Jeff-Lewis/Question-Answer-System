Via FlickrThe final reading for the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey came in at 82.5. Expectations were for a reading of 82.0. The preliminary reading, reported two weeks ago, came in at 81.2,  below expectations for an 83.0 reading. Following the report Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. Strategist at TD Securities, said, "The final June Michigan consumer confidence report outperformed market expectations, revised to 82.5 from a preliminary 81.2 reading. This leaves Michigan confidence higher on the month, with the 82.5 June print showing some progress in consumer sentiment compared with the 81.9 reading in May… Overall, we believe that the improvement shown by both the Michigan and Conference Board confidence surveys suggests a gradual improvement in consumer moods, boding well for spending activity in the coming months — a factor which should help a rebound in growth following the weather-induced weakness in Q1."
