How should I start investing my money as a 26 year old with no related knowledge? appeared as a question on Quora. Below we are printing part of an answer from growth hacker and entrepreneur Rizwan Aseem. In 2008 I wanted to invest in Apple stock. The price at that time was close to $90. The price today is over $700, that's before adjusting for the 7:1 stock split and dividend. I read all the reports, ran all the numbers, figured out how much money the business was actually worth — it looked like a great investment. Then I read the news reports, financial analysis by "experts" and the doom and gloom reports that were in the media. I read how Apple was about to go down, that investors had lost confidence in Apple being able to innovate, that their last success the "iPod" was a has-been. I read how other companies were giving Apple a run for their money, shipping more units of every product line that Apple had, eating away Apple's market share in its core markets, and destroying Apple by selling similar spec'ed products for half the price. I read the news. Thus I did not invest in Apple. I invested in other places and didn't make as much as I could've made by investing in Apple. In fact, the value of my investment would have been $250,000 higher than it is now. Hindsight is always 20/20 — this taught me a wonderful lesson. You have all the knowledge and experience that you need in the world Also, f--- what the assholes say in the news — do your research and then buy a business. FREE AppDownload
