Smith &amp; Wesson has shot its bolt for now. Shares of the US gunmaker sank nearly nine percent to $15.52 on Friday after the company projected an even steeper decline in sales and profits in fiscal 2015 than analysts expected. The weak outlook is due to a big drop in demand for semi-automatic rifles. Company executives, while remaining bullish on long-term demand for guns, said the near-term decline was expected after purchases of "modern sporting rifles" -- industry jargon for semi-automatic weapons -- surged following the December 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 young schoolchildren were killed. Gun enthusiasts went on a buying spree in the months after the carnage, fearing President Barack Obama and gun control advocates in Congress would succeed in placing new checks on weapons purchases. However, new gun control legislation has stalled in Washington, and with it, so have sales of semi-automatic weapons. Smith &amp; Wesson late Thursday posted a 4.6 percent decline year-over-year in sales in the fourth quarter ended April 30, to $170.4 million. Smith &amp; Wesson forecast fiscal 2015 sales of $585-$600 million, down from $626.6 million in fiscal 2014 -- a record. Net income per diluted share is expected at $1.30-$1.40, down from $1.49 in 2014. Despite the weaker outlook, Smith &amp; Wesson executives pointed to some bright spots. Demand for handguns remained brisk, with sales rising 30 percent in the fourth quarter. Officials also expressed confidence in the overall growth of the market, noting that the company still expects the gun market to expand between eight and 10 percent annually over the long term.
