Lululemon almost never discounts its merchandise.  So when its $98 stretch pants go on sale, fans go crazy.  Carylye Wisel at The Cut braved Lululemon's warehouse sale in New Jersey and wrote about the experience.  Wisel took a 5:30 a.m. train from New York City to the sale, where she met other Lululemon enthusiasts.  Once there, she found long lines, security guards, and people who had flown across the country for the event.  "(One woman) chimes in with war stories from Chicago's Lululemon Warehouse Sale (much crazier than this)," Wisel writes. "Turns out she and her friends booked a flight to New York the second they heard Long Island would be hosting this year's sale, and flew in specifically for it." The woman told Wisel that she got to New Jersey with just two hours to spare and booked a hotel room across the street from the sale.  The sale included $55 pants--a deep discount from the usual $98.  Still, it's not difficult to see why Lululemon customers are among the most fanatical in retail.
