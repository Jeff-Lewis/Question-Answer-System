Wikimedia CommonsMorgan Stanley has released a new report on secular growth stocks. The 42 stocks are companies they believe will grow irrespective of fluctuations in the business cycle. Tech companies like Facebook and Google dominate the list. There are also a lot of healthcare companies, which are benefiting from the aging population. "We believe that the names selected for this report can grow strongly even if the global economy grows more slowly than our current GDP forecasts," the report states. "Indeed, growth stocks on the whole tend to be less impacted by cyclical forces, one of the reasons that, over time, they’re more likely to meet or beat estimates than their value counterparts." Note: The EPS growth is the projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2013-2016, the PE estimates are based on 2014 Morgan Stanley research expectations, and the PEG ratio refers to the price-earnings to growth ratio which is an indicator of the stock's valuation. Growth stocks with lower PEGs are generally considered cheaper. FREE AppDownload
