Scott Olson / Getty ImagesU.S. Treasury securities have been tumbling, sending interest rates higher. Trading volume has been massive, and top analysts like Goldman Sachs are convinced the sell-off is for real. However, UBS is coming up on the other side of this trade in a brief note titled "Buy Treasuries." "In our opinion, Treasury yields have risen too far, too quickly," said Mike Schumacher. He provides three points, which we present verbatim: "We typically avoid big duration calls, because we believe they typically offer poor risk/return trade-offs," he added.  "However, we are making an exception." "The yield has not been this far out of line since August 2012," he wrote regarding his model. "Briefly, the model contains two predictor variables. One is a function of economic surprises, and the other is linked to eurozone peripheral spreads. Confidence intervals are critical, and our range for this model is +/- 40bp."
