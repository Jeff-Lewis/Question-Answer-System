"The Trustee brings this action against Defendants for acts and omissions that culminated in the business collapse of the Company and the bankruptcies of the Debtors. As detailed herein, Defendants, in their capacities as officers, breached their fiduciary duties of care,loyalty, and oversight over the Company, and failed to act in good faith," the complaint states.
