Flickr/Blake PattersonBloomberg News' Zeke Faux has this fascinating story about billionaire Carl Icahn from his early days on the Street working as a young broker.   This is an unconfirmed story, but we could totally see this happening.  From Bloomberg News: Billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s first Wall Street job was at Dreyfus &amp; Co., according to his website. A former colleague who asked not to be identified because he still works in the industry said he knew Icahn would be successful when the colleague was trying to pick up a woman at a dance at a Catskills resort and saw Icahn sign up her father as a client. Icahn and Weill didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. Well played, sir. [Hat Tip: Kevin Roose] FREE AppDownload
