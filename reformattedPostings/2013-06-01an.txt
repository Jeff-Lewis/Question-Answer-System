Justin Sullivan/ Getty ImagesApple CEO Tim Cook at WWDC 2012Apple hosts its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) June 10-14. The tech juggernaut isn't expected to unveil any new devices at the event, which will instead focus on the software side of things, especially the iOS mobile operating system that runs on iPhones and iPads. "As such, other than some refreshes for the Mac line, expectations for earnings-moving product releases appear to be appropriately muted heading into this event," writes a Goldman Sachs team of equity analysts led by Bill Shope. "Nevertheless, we continue to believe that WWDC could be a positive catalyst for the story, as the reveal of iOS 7 and enhancements to iOS services could begin to change the broad perception that Apple’s ability to innovate has been impaired." Here is what Goldman wants to see from Apple: The Goldman analysts have a "Buy" rating and a 12-month price target of $500 for Apple shares (which closed Friday at $449.73). "Overall, we continue to believe Apple needs to launch a series of successful new iOS products this fall for the stock to fully begin its recovery," says Shope and his team, "but in the meantime, the software and services enhancements at WWDC should serve as positive catalysts and important indicators of Apple’s longer-term technology focus and direction."
