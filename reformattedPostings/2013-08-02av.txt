REUTERS/ Mike SegarAmerica's largest hedge funds have $1.47 trillion in net assets and more than $1 trillion in debt, according to a new report from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC issued the report — the first of its kind — to Congress last week, according to Bloomberg.  Under Dodd-Frank, legislators directed the SEC to collect information from hedge funds and private equity firms. The new reporting rules require hedge fund managers with more than than $1.5 billion in gross assets to file quarterly with the SEC (and for each separate fund with more than $500 million, they have to further detail leverage and risk). We also get a better picture of liquidity from the report. From Bloomberg: Twenty-seven percent of their $1.47 trillion in net assets could be divested within a day, according to the SEC. Fifty-three percent of the net assets could be liquidated in a week or less, the large managers said, and 71 percent would take no more than a month to sell. Fifteen percent of assets would take more than six months to liquidate. Of the entire $1.47 trillion pool, investors could cash out about a quarter of their money within a month.
