The end of the year holiday season can be a huge money suck as people buy gifts for family, friends, and coworkers. But we should also remember to thank the people who make our lives easier throughout the year: building superintendents, babysitters, hairstylists, dog walkers, and a whole host of other people. The question, of course, is how much? We spoke with etiquette expert Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick of The Etiquette School of New York to find out more about holiday tipping and gifting. She helpfully broke down her recommendations and advice on who — and how much — to tip. Park Avenue Documentary"We have to be very good to the service staff in our buildings because they're very good to us," Napier-Fitzpatrick explained to Business Insider. "Take into account how long you've been in the building, how important their service is to you, the frequency of the service, and the quality, plus what you gave last year." Superintendent: $50 – $200 Doorman/Concierge: $50 – $150 Elevator Operator: $25 – $50 Porters/Handymen: $25 – $50 Parking Garage Attendants: $25 – $75 Flickr/belljar77The standard here is to give one week's pay to one month's pay, but it varies by how long they've been with you. "If you've had a nanny for five years, you'd probably give her more than one week's salary," Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "You'd probably give her a month's salary." Housekeeper/Maid: One week’s pay, or less if not a weekly service Nanny: One week to one month’s pay, and a small gift from your child Au Pair: One week’s pay and a small gift from your child Babysitter: One night's pay, plus a small gift from your child Daily Dog Walker: One day’s pay Day Care Provider: $25 to $75 each, and a small gift from your child *Teachers/Coaches: Small gift from your child *Child’s Teacher: A small gift from you and one from your child *Coaches/Tutors/Music Teachers: A small gift from your child *Be sure to check with the school before you give cash or gift cards to make sure it's acceptable. Napier-Fitzpatrick told us another great way to give back to the teacher is for all parents to get together and get him or her a single gift certificate so that no one parent looks bad. AP/Diane BondareffThis is less mandatory than the first two categories, but if you use a service all year round like a personal trainer or hair stylist, you should give them a little gift. "Most of these people we're tipping all year, so we don't have to go overboard," Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "But at least give them the cost of one service." Hair Stylist/Colorist: The cost of one visit, or a gift equaling that amount Shampoo Person: $10 or a small gift Manicurist/Pedicurist: $15 – $25, or a small gift Massage Therapist: $15, or a small gift Personal Trainer: One session’s cost, or a gift equaling that amount Flickr/NinaZedAgain, base these tips on how often you used their services in the past year. Dog Groomer: A fourth or half the cost of one grooming session Newspaper Delivery Person: $25 – $50 or $10 if once a week. Mail Carrier: Gift up to $20 in value (there are legal restrictions on what USPS workers can accept) UPS/FedEx Regular Driver: $20 – $25 Trash Collector: $10 -$20 each. Pool Cleaner: Cost of one cleaning Gardener: One week’s pay, or less if they work for you occasionally Make sure to put the money in a holiday card and an envelope. "All of the stationary stores today sell money cards, which have a 'Happy Holidays!' message with a nice little pouch for cash," Napier-Fitzpatrick added. You can give a check, but it's best to go to the bank and take out crisp dollar bills. Write a little note, such as: "Thank you for your service throughout the year, we really appreciate you making our lives easier" and sign your name at the bottom. And last but not least, try to give the tip in person. "People appreciate it," Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "It's a personal touch." FREE AppDownload
