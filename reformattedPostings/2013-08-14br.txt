Sun — shocked the world when they respectively won the gold, silver and bronze medals in the 54th International Mathematical Olympiad in Santa Marta, Colombia.  While the U.S. team placed third overall — Song competed on Team Canada — the trio won the medals for individual performance.  The annual competition is a six question, two day, nine hour proof competition with competitors from over 100 countries on 5 continents.  Here's this year's set of questions via the IMO website.
