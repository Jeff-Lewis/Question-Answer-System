This afternoon, the market briefly lost $136 billion when someone hacked the Associated Press' Twitter feed and tweeted that the White House had been attacked and that President Obama had been injured. The market quickly regained its footing as everyone realized what was going on, but this incident serves as a reminder that the market moves in the blink of an eye, and is subject not only to the whims of millions, but also sometimes the recklessness of one.

What this chart shows is the depth of volume in the market when the false tweet broke and a ton of traders started to sell, then how the depth stabilized as the world realized that the news was inaccurate.
