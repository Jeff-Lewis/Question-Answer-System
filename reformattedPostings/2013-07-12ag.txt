Industrial decline, economic stagnation, and white flight led to the dramatic downturn for America's largest city. Gotham had an unprecedented fiscal crisis in 1975, and two years later the city descended into chaos after the power went out for 25 hours. New York City saw 1,814 homicides in 1980 — three times what we have today — while the population declined to just over 7 million from nearly 8 million a decade before. At the same time, crack and heroin infested the city, driving the crime rate even higher. Robert Stutman, a former special agent for the NYC DEA, told Frontline, "Crack literally changed the entire face of the city. Street violence had grown. Child abuse had grown hugely. Spousal abuse. I had a special crack violence file that I kept to convince the geniuses in Washington who kept telling me it wasn't a problem." By 1990, the annual homicides in New York peaked at 2,245. The city lived in fear.
