For that reason, among others, the trades that do become a part of history have to be incredibly epic. And it can't just be that they netted someone an incredible amount of money, great trades are even more than that. A really great trade is something that happens when a trader uses all their cunning and intuition to find just the right moment to strike — sometimes when everyone else thinks they're out of their mind.

That takes intelligence, conviction, and grit. Business Insider has compiled a list of traders throughout history who've used all those qualities to execute some of the greatest trades of all time.
