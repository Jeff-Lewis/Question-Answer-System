Back then, nobody could predict how people would be using their devices the way they do today — swiping Tinder matches, ordering Uber taxis, and of course, reading Business Insider.  That said, we're looking to find out more about how you use your different devices to read and share stories. Do you prefer reading articles on your smartphone or tablet? How active are you on Facebook and Twitter? Are you a fan of watching videos on your phone?  Click here to take our survey. All we need is five minutes of your time.  Thanks in advance for your candid answers. FREE AppDownload
