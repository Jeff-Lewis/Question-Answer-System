RBC Capital Markets The above map comes from RBC Capital Markets. It is a GDP heat map, showing the estimated growth rate of every country in the world for next year based on International Monetary Fund numbers. There are a few things to note here: Europe is looking pale. Argentina and Venezuela are in for a rough year. Brazil isn't looking so hot, either. Both Libya and South Sudan are set to have great year-over-year growth — although that's likely because war has had such drastic effects on them this past year. This is what the heat map for 2014 looks like:  RBC Capital Markets
