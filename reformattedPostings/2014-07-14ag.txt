Jake Rajas/Sotheby'sAnother incredible Hamptons estate is up for grabs. Known as "Angel View," the 15,000-square-foot estate in North Haven is selling for an astronomical $65 million through Harald Grant of Sotheby's. Although the identity of the owners is private, Grant told The Wall Street Journal that they are looking to downsize now that their children are grown up. The home sits on 6.5 acres and has 500 feet of waterfront on Noyack Bay. Amenities include a "grotto" room with an indoor pool, two outdoor infinity pools, and a tennis court.
