It should be noted that bank earnings announcements tend to be very noisy, so the reported EPS may not be comparable to the consensus EPS. Here's all of that noise: As previously announced, financial results in the fourth quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted by a provision of $2.7 billion related to the settlements with Fannie Mae with respect to representations and warranties and compensatory fees; other provision items of $2.5 billion which included a $1.1 billion provision for the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR) acceleration agreement, total litigation expense of $0.9 billion and a $0.5 billion provision for obligations related to mortgage insurance rescissions; and $0.7 billion of negative debit valuation adjustments (DVA) and fair value option (FVO) adjustments due to improvement in the company's credit spreads. These items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit of $1.3 billion primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries; a gain of $0.4 billion on the previously announced sale of the company's 49-percent stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Merrill Lynch PB Securities; and a positive valuation adjustment on mortgage servicing rights (MSR) of $0.3 billion related to the previously announced servicing sales.
