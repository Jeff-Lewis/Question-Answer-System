Wikimedia CommonsJPM just reported earnings that was slightly better than expected.  I just read through the whole report.  I was surprised at the strong performance of the investment bank (given the rapid move higher in rates), and not surprised at the large decrease in allowance for loan losses across multiple businesses, which helped to offset decreasing net interest margins and low loan demand as portfolio runoff continued. Overall, JPM’s report is a confirmation of improving consumer confidence on the consumption and asset investment fronts, but continued hesitation on business investment.  The stock is currently trading around flat, after trading up, then down in the pre-market.  The reaction is based more often on the composition of earnings rather than the headline (since banks have so many marking levers to move the total earnings result).  Here were the main positives and negatives I saw: Positives:   Negatives:   Overall, JPM’s results paint the portrait of a bank taking on less and less market risk (VaR was near a 5 year low), benefitting from the mark-to-market improvement of its current asset portfolio (primarily through loan loss reserve decreases), but struggling to increase its revenue base in existing businesses. Increasingly, JPM is starting to look like a utility (better for the financial system, worse for investors looking for earnings growth).  At around 10x P/E though, most investors in JPM are likely of the value variety, happy with the near 3% dividend and cheap valuation even if earnings growth is only 5-10% going forward.  Of course, many others probably stay away given the unanticipated risks of managing such a large balance sheet (as shown by the Whale fiasco last year).
