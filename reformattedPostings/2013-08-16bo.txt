Global markets are selling off. But nowhere is it worse than India. "India's Sensex 4% drop, the largest in more than 4 years, essential offset the previous four day advance," noted Brown Brothers Harriman's Marc  Chandler. "Basic materials and banks were the hardest hit sectors. "Many reports attributed the sharp losses to renewed weakness of the rupee, which fell to new record lows against the dollar, despite official efforts to tighten restrictions on capital outflows." The sell-off was also driven by Moody's move to downgrade the bank financial strength ratings (BFSRs) and baseline credit assessments (BCAs) of three Indian public sector banks. From the release: " The BCA downgrades for Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank, and the negative outlook assigned to Union Bank of India primarily reflect the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment, which have been exacerbated by the depreciating rupee and high levels of inflation. "Measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to support the currency have not reversed the depreciation, implying that interest rates may remain elevated for a longer time. "Against such a backdrop, Moody's expects public sector banks in particular to find difficulty in responding to slower economic growth, deteriorating asset quality, and declining margins."
