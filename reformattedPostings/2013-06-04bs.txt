Home prices (including distressed sales) climbed 12.1% year-over-year in April, according to Corelogic's latest home price report. Home prices were up 3.2% month-over-month in April.  This was the biggest year-over-year increase since February 2006, and the 14th straight monthly increase. Moreover, on an annual basis, home prices were up in all 50 states for the second straight month.  Ex-distressed sales home prices were up 11.9% on the year, and 3% on the month.  "Increasing demand for new and existing homes, coupled with low inventory, has created a virtuous cycle for price gains, most clearly seen in the Western states with year-over-year gains of 20 percent or more," said Mark Fleming, CoreLogic CEO in a press release.  Here some details from the report: Here's a look at home prices from January 2002 on:Business Insider FREE AppDownload
