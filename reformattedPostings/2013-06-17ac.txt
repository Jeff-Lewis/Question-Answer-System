China's credit bubble is unlike anything in modern history, according to Fitch.  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of The Daily Telegraph reported that Fitch thinks the scale of Chinese credit is so massive that it can no longer grow out of its excesses. And the statistics are scary: In light of this, we put together four charts on China's credit bubble that you need to see. Societe Generale In China, wealth management products are popular, interest-bearing retail products that are backed by a hodge-podge of risky assets. They function as a replacement for normal investment/savings accounts, but are not guaranteed.  A crackdown on Wealth Management Products (WMPs) has seen WMP issuance slow in 2013. But Charlene Chu at Fitch writes that this continues to pose a risk to the banking sector because it accounts for a "sizable amount of funding." "In Fitch's view, the primary risk centers on the cash payout pressure posed by WMPs' short-term nature, the poor liquidity of underlying assets, the high mobility of WMP investors, and banks' mismatched assets and liabilities." Fitch  Fitch SHIBOR is considered a useful proxy for liquidity in the Chinese credit markets, more specifically, the recent spike in Shibor showed a liquidity squeeze. In a new note, Morgan Stanley's Richard Xu writes that "SHIBOR and repo two-week rates did not ease significantly after the three-day holiday, and one-month rates even spiked by ~80bps, implying that the recent liquidity tightness is likely more associated with recent intense regulatory actions than holiday effect."
