Flickr/Mr. T in DCHEADS UP: The world's biggest economies have their April manufacturing PMI reports. And this is our scorecard. And the reports reflect a global deceleration. China's official manufacturing PMI report slipped to 50.6 from 50.9 in March.  China's unofficial HSBC PMI fell to 50.4 from 51.6. In the U.S., the ISM and PMI manufacturing reports each fell. However, the Chinese and U.S. numbers all remain above 50.0, which indicates expansion. In Europe, Spain, Italy, France and Greece all posted modest increases in their PMIs.  However, they are all in contractionary territory.
