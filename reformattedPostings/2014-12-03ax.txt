REUTERS/Andres Stapff Global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney has conducted a survey to find out just how connected consumers across the world are to the internet.  Their findings show a world much further along on the path to constant technological connectivity than many might have thought.  For the survey, A.T. Kearney interviewed 10,000 people across ten different countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa, and Nigeria. Every country surveyed, except for South Africa, is in the top ten of Internet-using countries in terms of number of users.   Here’s what the survey discovered about how consumers use the internet, behave on the internet, and how they buy things on the internet.  A.T.
