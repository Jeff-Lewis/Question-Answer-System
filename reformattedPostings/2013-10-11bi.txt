Reuters/ Charles PlatiauPlenty of whiskey drinkers start with (and stick with) bourbon, as it tends to be cheaper and more accessible than its Scotch whiskey brethren. It comes down to personal taste, of course, but not all bourbons are created equally. Leave that to the judges. In the "Whiskey - USA" category at this year's International Wine and Spirit Competition this summer, great bottles of bourbon won a "Gold," but the very best took home a "Gold Outstanding" for setting the industry standard for excellence. These liquids all went through the gauntlet, subject to professional blind tasting and chemical and microbiological analysis at the competition. Perhaps even better than the bourbon are the judges' descriptions: "Big, rich and full bodied in the mouth with toffee, gentle vanilla and some molasses giving sensation of slow, deliberate flow across the palate."
