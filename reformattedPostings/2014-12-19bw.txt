CNBCBill GrossBill Gross' new employer thinks he's Peyton Manning. A profile of Bill Gross' new employer — Janus Capital — from Bloomberg's Mary Childs finds the Colorado-based investment manager comparing Gross that state's favorite athlete: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning.  "Bill Gross is our Peyton Manning, that game-changing level of talent for us," Janus CEO Richard Weil told Childs. "People are looking at us."

Earlier this week, we heard from Gross in a TV interview with CNBC, in which he said that TIPS "look great" just a week after rival star bonds investor Jeffrey Gundlach said "TIPS are for losers."
