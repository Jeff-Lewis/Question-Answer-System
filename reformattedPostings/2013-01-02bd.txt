Ezra Klein Chris Christie just went on an epic tirade against Congress for failing to pass a Superstorm Sandy relief bill. One reason for his outrage at not getting help: New Jersey contributes way more in federal taxes than it gets back from the government. He says this should be a reason that New Jersey gets extra help in times of need, not a reason to be ignored. Via Ezra Klein, the above map shows which states (in red) receive more than a dollar back for every dollar they pay in taxes. The blue states all pay more in taxes than they get back. New Jersey is a blue state. A key feature of the chart is that almost every "blue" state on here, is also a blue state politically (meaning it usually votes Dem). Texas is the one exception.
