Marc Angeles for Coldwell BankerWelcome to the Palazzo di Amore.There is no shortage of over-the-top mansions around the country. But the Beverly Hills estate of real estate mogul Jeff Greene, which just hit the market with a price tag of $195 million — making it the new most expensive home for sale in the US — is in a league of its own. Known as the "Palazzo di Amore," Greene's home was built for parties. It has an entertainment complex and ballroom that can fit 250 guests, a private-label vineyard, and parking garages for more than two dozen cars. Greene, who made a fortune when the real estate bubble burst, is worth some $2.2 billion. With its $195 million listing price, his home is by far the most expensive on the market, beating a Florida home currently listed at $139 million. Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International have the listing.
