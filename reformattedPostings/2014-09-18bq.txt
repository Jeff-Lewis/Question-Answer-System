REUTERS/Dylan Martinez Scotland is voting Thursday on whether to become independent from the UK, and it's expected to be a VERY late night. Final results in the big cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh won't be reported until about 5 a.m. Friday local time (or midnight ET). (You can read our live blog of the election here.) But we might know earlier than that.  According to The Political Bookie, a blog of the gambling site Ladbrokes, you should watch the voting in the council of North Lanarkshire, which will announce its results at 2 a.m. local time Friday morning (or 9 p.m. ET Thursday). The Ladbrokes odds for North Lanarkshire are very evenly split. Here's what they say: North Lanarkshire on the other hand could set the tone early on. This is one of the most populous regions and at the moment, we can’t split YES and NO: Ladbrokes If NO wins here, then I’d be fairly certain that Scotland is staying in the UK. A YES win with over 53% or so would indicate that the nationalists are on course to go very close. Clackmannanshire at 2.30 could also be interesting — we rate this as the second most likely area to go YES after Dundee, so if they can’t win here, that will be a very poor showing. So we'll be watching North Lanarkshire through the night to see if we can get an early sense of which way Scotland is going.
