Kevin Bauman Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has declared a financial emergency in the city of Detroit. He has also threatened to have an emergency financial manager take control over the troubled city after March 12 if local officials don't come up with a plan to remedy the city's troubled finances. Detroit has a $327 million budget deficit, and it's drowning in more than $14 billion in long-term debt. As it deals with its ongoing financial crisis, the city has instituted mandatory unpaid days off for many city workers and it has left many of its key service departments such as the police and fire departments underfunded. Once a prosperous hub for the American automotive industry, Detroit has seen its population dwindle from 1.8 million in 1950 to 706k in 2011. The beleaguered city has seen its neighborhoods abandoned, its properties vandalized, and its homes stripped of any valuable materials such as copper piping and roofing. And the images are stunning. Photographer Kevin Bauman has collected beautiful photos of 100 abandoned Detroit homes.
