WGRZ.comUpdate: Police released these two men after detaining them for five hours, the Niagra Falls Review reported. Original story: Police have stopped two people in Niagara Falls, N.Y. in a car with suspicious backpacks and a Massachusetts license plate, wgrz.com reports, citing a "high ranking source." Bomb techs were looking at four suspicious backpacks in the car in Niagara Falls, a source told wgrz. The FBI's joint-terrorism task force was assisting local police with the search. A source initially told the news station that the two men were Russian nationals, but police have told wgrz that actually isn't true. We reached out to the Niagara Falls police department. Everyone who could comment on the situation with the Russian nationals was "at the scene," a police representative said. There's currently a hunt in the Boston area for 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who's believed to have planted the Boston Marathon bomb along with his brother, 26-year-old brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who's now dead.
