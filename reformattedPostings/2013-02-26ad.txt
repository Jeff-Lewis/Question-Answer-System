Guang Niu/Getty ImagesChina is the world's second largest economy, yet it exercises tremendous capital control including restrictions on its currency, the renminbi.  Chinese officials have previously said that they want to make the currency fully convertible by 2015. Some, like Deutsche Bank's Alan Cloete, have made bolder claims. He expects the renminbi to become a major reserve currency in the next decade and that it could begin to threaten the greenback. And Berkley economist Barry Eichengreen has said it could account for 15 percent of global currency reserve holdings around the end of the decade. More conservative estimates say full convertibility is at least 10 – 15 years away. But China's currency has come a long way in the last two decades. The Use of FECs People screaming for the internationalization of the renminbi often forget that until the mid-1990s, foreigners in China could only purchase goods and services with foreign exchange certificates (FECs). These were denominated in yuan but sold at a premium and, as expected, led to a thriving black market. FECs were phased out in 1995 as Beijing began to open up. Once FEC's were phased out, China could open up its current account and use the renminbi to settle trade. "This opened the door for China to make the Renminbi convertible for current account (i.e., trade) transactions the following year," wrote Patrick Chovanec, professor at Tsinghua University. But China continued to exercise strict capital controls establishing 'B shares' that were denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, and that only foreigners could invest in until 2001. "In effect, the inability to freely buy and sell Renminbi was used as a firewall to insulate China’s financial markets from the outside world," writes Chovanec. FREE AppDownload
