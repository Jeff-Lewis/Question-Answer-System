Exports rose 15.3 percent in September compared with a year ago, the General Administration of Customs said, beating a median forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 11.8 percent. Imports rose 7 percent in terms of value, compared to a Reuters estimate for a 2.7 percent fall. That led to a trader surplus of $31 billion, lagging forecasts for a surplus of $41 billion. China's economy, the world's second largest, has had a bumpy ride this year. Activity has been dampened by unsteady exports and a slowdown in domestic demand that has been compounded by a cooling housing market. As a result, authorities have repeatedly warned that China may miss its target to grow its trade sector by 7.5 percent this year.
