Bloomberg has an amazing team of reporters hunting down the world's billionaires. Some of these super wealthy are out in the open and living opulently, others are hidden and living modestly. Veteran billionaire tracker Matt G. Miller and his team will find them and rank them. And now Bloomberg has created a new data visualization tool that will let you see the world's richest in a way you've never seen them before. Not only can you filter billionaires by country, gender, and industry, but you can also track their wealth and rank on a day to day basis. Right now the list includes 100 billionaires, but expect this application to grow. Miller says he and his team have 100s of suspects and they're working every day.
