REUTERS/Thomas Peter A picture shows a figure that was created by means of 3D printing in Berlin, January 7, 2013. Figure is a 3D printed representation in plastic of the original model that was recorded with 3D scanning technology by Gismo at the Raumfahrtagentur hacker space in Berlin. Shares in 3-D Systems (ticker DDD) are off nearly 27% this morning after the company announced it was ramping up spending, which would impact earnings. The company now sees adjusted 2014 earnings per share coming in at $0.73 to $0.85. Consensus expectations according to Bloomberg was $1.29.  The company develops and manufactures 3-D printers, which can make components for everything from body parts to guns (as well as desktop widgets like the one above). Expected 2013 adjusted EPS also missed expectations. The company now sees a range $0.83 to $0.97 — a downward revision from $0.93 to $1.03, and below the consensus estimate of $0.97. Revenue came in in-line with expectations. Last month, Credit Suisse downgraded 3-D on concerns about losing market share to rival Stratasys. Dow Jones reports DDD has announced “substantial” R&amp;D spending increases to try to close that gap. “As we previously stated, we are willing to tolerate earnings reduction and even slight gross-profit-margin compression during this period to substantially accelerate our growth rate and market share,” says CEO Avi Reichental. All 3-D printing stocks are suffering this morning though, with Stratasys down nearly 12% and ExOne down 14%. Both gave mixed-to-weak outlooks for 2014 last month.
