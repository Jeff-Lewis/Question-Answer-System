The news that the SEC will begin allowing hedge fund to publicly advertise has set Twitter ablaze with suggestions for slogans. Or, as they say on twitter, #hedgefundslogans. Some of our favorites: "Fee all that you can fee." "Trades great! More billing!"— "Can't spell hedge fund without F-U-N!" "You may remember our stock picks on Twitter" "Please don't squeeze the Ackman" "Two and Twenty-Somethings" "Alpha for the rest of us!" "Come for the survivorship bias-inflated returns, stay for the five year lock-up period."  "Hedged today, gone tomorrow." "I don't always pay for underperformance, but when I do I pay 2 and 20."  "Real men don't need liquidity"  "I'm a Tepper, You're a Tepper"  They SEC, NFA, and @whitehouse are in our pockets.... Shouldn't you be?  —By CNBC's John Carney. Follow me on Twitter @Carney FREE AppDownload
