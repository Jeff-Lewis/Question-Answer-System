Small and independent American craft breweries added $33.9 billion to the U.S. economy in 2012, according to a new report from the Brewers Association. California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and Colorado made the largest economic contribution overall. On a per capita level, Oregon was the best state, at $448.56 a person, followed by Colorado, Vermont, Maine, and Montana. "The figure is derived from the total impact of beer brewed by craft brewers as it moves through the three-tier system (breweries, wholesalers and retailers), as well as all non-beer products that brewpub restaurants sell," according to the report.
