Henry Blodget, Business InsiderThe folks who run the excellent DLD conference in Munich were kind enough to ask me to speak again this year. And they took great care of me. They flew me over business class, put me up at a five-star hotel, and then chauffered me to Davos. That was extremely classy of them. Who doesn't love to be treated like George Clooney? I've told you about my flight (there was only one lousy part of it). So now I'll tell you about my hotel. The Bayerischer Hof is smack-dab in the center of Munich. You can walk to everything--even the Apple Store.
