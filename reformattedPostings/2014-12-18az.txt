The "Dog Whisperer" Cesar Millan is a world renowned dog behaviorist and entrepreneur. The Mexican-born immigrant rose to fame in 2004 with a hit TV show "Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan" on National Geographic, and founded the Dog Psychology Center for the rehabilitation of aggressive dogs. But in 2010 he lost most of his fortune in a series of bad investments, his wife left him and his pitbull Daddy passed away. Millan was devastated and attempted suicide.  Three years later, Millan built his business back and expanded it internationally, starred in new TV series – "Cesar Millan's Leader of the Pack" (2013) and "Cesar 911" (2014), and wrote a new book.  In an interview with Behind The Brand, Millan reflects on hitting rock bottom and learning from his failure.  WATCH MORE: The Full Interview With Cesar Millan Behind The Brand takes you behind the scenes at some of the coolest brands as well as talk with world-class thought leaders and entrepreneurs so you can get an inside look at how they do it.
