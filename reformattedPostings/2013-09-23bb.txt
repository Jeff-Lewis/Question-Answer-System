REUTERSOn Friday Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi alerted readers to a column on Forbes.com from a man named Harry Binswanger. The column is called "Give Back? Yes, It's Time For The 99% To Give Back To The 1%" It does not appear to be a joke. Nor does Binswanger. Here is his Amazon page. According to his bio, Binswanger earned his Ph.D in philosophy from Columbia and now serves as "a professor of philosophy at the Objectivist Academic Center of the Ayn Rand Institute," a non-profit based in Irvine, Calif. that coordinates spreading the gospel of Rand's objectivist philosophy. So it seems we have to take everything we're about to show you from Binswanger at face value. We've reached out to him, but haven't heard back. Here then, are the five most unbelievable lines from the piece. FREE AppDownload
