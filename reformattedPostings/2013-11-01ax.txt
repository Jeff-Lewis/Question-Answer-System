BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR GlobalIn the week ended October 30, investors poured another $12.4 billion into global equity funds — with $4 billion of the total going into long-only funds, according to the latest data from EPFR Global. In a note to clients — titled "It's Getting Frothy, Man!" — BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett writes, "Another $8-9 billion of inflows to long-only equity funds over next 2 weeks would trigger a contrarian 'sell' signal (Chart 2). Bullish investor flows dovetails with our Bull &amp; Bear Index, which is on course to trigger a cautionary risk- off signal in mid-November."

"A breach of the 8.0 level on our Bull &amp; Bear Index would make us more negative short term," wrote Hartnett. "Cash remains high, 4.4% in our October Fund Manager Survey, and needs to fall below 4.0% in the November survey to help trigger a tactical 'sell signal'."
