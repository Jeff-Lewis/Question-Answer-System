Since 1947, when the U.S. economy has not been in a recession, economic activity has only contracted in 11 quarters. This most recent quarter was the worst of these, with GDP shrinking by 2.9 percent. Following negative quarters that occur absent a recession, however, the average rebound in economic growth has been more than 3 percent. When an expansion is clearly underway, the average rebound has been over 4 percent, with economic growth two quarters after the decline averaging 3.8 percent. Guggenheim Partners FREE AppDownload
