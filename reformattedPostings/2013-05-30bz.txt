The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam is this Saturday and test-takers are probably freaking out. The CFA, which has three levels, is considered to be the most difficult test on Wall Street with fewer than 20 percent of candidates passing all three on the first try. The average test-taker also spends a solid five to six months preparing for the CFA. That's not the only reason they'd be freaking out, though. Every test-taker hopes things go smoothly and according to plan, but we've heard some crazy horror stories. We've included them here.  Make sure this doesn't happen to you.  FREE AppDownload
