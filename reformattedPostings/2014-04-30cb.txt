Quick heads up: Four big economic events are happening today. From Calculated Risk: • At 8:15 AM, the ADP Employment Report for April. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 210,000 payroll jobs added in April, up from 191,000 in March.• At 8:30 AM, Q1 GDP (advance estimate). This is the advance estimate of Q1 GDP from the BEA. The consensus is that real GDP increased 1.1% annualized in Q1.• At 9:45 AM, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for April. The consensus is for an increase to 56.9, up from 55.9 in March.• At 2:00 PM, the FOMC Meeting Announcement. No change in interest rates is expected (for a long time). However the FOMC is expected to reduce QE3 asset purchases by $10 billion per month at this meeting. Each of these will be paid attention to closely, and we'll be covering each LIVE. FREE AppDownload
