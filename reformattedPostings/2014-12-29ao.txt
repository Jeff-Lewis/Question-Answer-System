So we've taken it upon ourselves to revamp last year's list of the most obnoxious Wall Street bars. Several have since closed, but many are still kicking and as annoying as ever. Frequented by financiers, these Manhattan bars are loud, rowdy, and ridiculous. If you're into sweaty crowds, flashing lights, or absurd conversations, it's time to scope some of these out. Otherwise, we've done the rounds on these bars so you don't have to. You're welcome. If we left out any of your favorites, let us know in the comments! FREE AppDownload
