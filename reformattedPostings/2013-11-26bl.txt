Forward earnings, which is the time-weighted average of consensus operating earnings for the current year and next year, is a very good year-ahead leading indicator of actual earnings over the next four quarters So there's a good chance that the S&amp;P 500 will earn about $120 per share in 2014, which coincides with my forecast. That forward earnings number is currently in the market with the forward P/E at 15, up from about 10 during the summer of 2011. That was a retest of the P/E low in March 2009. Forward earnings are also at record highs for the S&amp;P 400 MidCaps and S&amp;P 600 SmallCaps with their respective forward P/Es at 16.9 and 18.5.
