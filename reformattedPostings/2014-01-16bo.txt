This compared to net income of $1.2 billion, or $0.38 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.9 billion for the fourth quarter 2012. CVA/DVA was a negative $164 million ($100 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter, mainly resulting from the improvement in Citigroups credit spreads, compared to negative $485 million ($301 million after-tax) in the prior year period. Excluding CVA/DVA, fourth quarter revenues were $17.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2013 results also included a $189 million after-tax benefit related to the divestiture of Citis Credicard business in Brazil, while results in the prior year period included a $1.0 billion repositioning charge ($653 million after-tax). Excluding CVA/DVA, the impact of the Credicard divestiture in the fourth quarter 2013 and the fourth quarter 2012 repositioning charge, 6 earnings were $0.82 per diluted share, up 19% from the prior year period. Michael Corbat, Citigroups Chief Executive Officer, said, Although we didnt finish the year as strongly as we would have liked, we made substantial progress toward our key priorities in 2013. Having grown our operating net income by 15% over 2012, we achieved our highest amount of net income since before the financial crisis. We accelerated our growth in capital and ended the fourth quarter with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.5%, exceeding our target for the year. We also grew loans in our core businesses by 7%, utilized $2.4 billion of our deferred tax assets, and reduced the assets in Citi Holdings by 25% while cutting its annual loss in half. In addition, we improved our efficiency by executing on the repositioning actions announced at the end of 2012, reducing expenses and growing revenues. We enter 2014 as a strong and stable institution that is committed to achieving our 2015 financial targets and our objective of returning capital to our shareholders. Citigroup full year 2013 net income was $13.9 billion on revenues of $76.4 billion, compared to net income of $7.5 billion on revenues of $69.1 billion for the full year 2012. Full year 2013 results included negative CVA/DVA of $342 million ($213 million after-tax), compared to negative $2.3 billion ($1.4 billion after-tax) in the prior year. Citigroup full year 2012 results included a loss of $4.6 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the sale of various minority investments. 7 In addition, Citigroup recorded tax benefits of $176 million and $582 million in the third quarters 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the resolution of certain tax audit items. Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments in 2012, Citigroup revenues were $76.7 billion in 2013, up 1% compared to the prior year. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the Credicard divestiture, the tax benefits in 2013 and 2012, 8 and the fourth quarter 2012 repositioning charge, net income was $13.8 billion in 2013, up 15% compared to 2012, as higher revenues, lower operating expenses and lower net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate.   FREE AppDownload
