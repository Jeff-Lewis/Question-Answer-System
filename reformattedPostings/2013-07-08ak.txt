Analysts expected EPS of $0.06. The stock was up 1.5% after hours. Revenue also beat at $5.85 billion versus estimated $5.79 billion.

Second quarter 2013 net loss of $119 million, or $0.11 per share, compares to net income of $149 million, or $0.13 per share, in first quarter 2013, and a net loss of $2 million, or $0.00 per share, in second quarter 2012, the company said. Jim Cramer argued today the firm remains an excellent economic bellwether — "a global barometer of every single area that should be on fire if the rise in interest rates is right."

It hasn't done all that well on other days, either. The equity bull market has effectively passed it by. Alcoa has lagged behind the broad market by nearly 25 percentage points this year, leaving it near a four-year low.
