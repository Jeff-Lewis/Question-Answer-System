This is a key distressed market to follow since Las Vegas has seen the largest price decline of any of the Case-Shiller composite 20 cities.  The Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors reported GLVAR reports 19-month run of rising home prices, increased inventory There are several key trends that we've been following: 1) Overall sales were down slightly from July, and down about 4% year-over-year. 2) Conventional sales are up sharply.  In August 2012, only 39.4% of all sales were conventional.  This year, in August 2013, 67% were conventional.  That is an increase in conventional sales of about 63% (of course there is heavily investor buying, but that is still quite an increase in non-distressed sales). 3)  Most distressed sales are short sales instead of foreclosures (over 3 to 1). 4) and most interesting right now is that non-contingent inventory (year-over-year) is now increasing quickly.  Non-contingent inventory is up 41.1% year-over-year! This suggests inventory has bottomed in Las Vegas (A major theme for housing in 2013).  And this suggests price increases will slow.   FREE AppDownload
