REUTERS/ Sebastien NogierSince 1986, investing legend and Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien begins each January by attempting to predict the 10 big surprises of the coming year. Wien should be given major props for even trying to do what many investing gurus might not. But in the interest of keeping him honest, it's time to score his 2013 calls. In the past, Wien has seen about half of his predictions come true. Not bad. Though this year, he thought that stocks would fall and gold would reach $1,900 an ounce. And that has to count against him pretty big. NOTE: We awarded partial credit where partial credit was due. FREE AppDownload
