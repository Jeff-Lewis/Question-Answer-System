Business InsiderConsider this a friendly reminder of what really matters — the place you call home. For traders, home is their desk. It's where markets happen (and markets = life). That's why we asked our readers to send us photos of their desks to check out how people are doing this all over the world. They obliged, and we put the photos together in this slideshow. We're ready for another installment, though, so e-mail your trading desk set-up to jlaroche@businessinsider.com or llopez@businessinsider.com Until then, check out these trading spaces.
