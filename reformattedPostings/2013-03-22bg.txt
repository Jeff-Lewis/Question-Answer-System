Cyprus is in crunch mode today. The Cypriot parliament needs to get nine bills related to banking reform, capital controls, and setting up an investment fund to raise cash for a bailout of its banks and also submit its new proposal to the EU for consideration. New comments out of Cyprus via Reuters suggest a deal may be done today. Cyprus ruling party says a bailout deal acceptable to the EU may be only hours away.
