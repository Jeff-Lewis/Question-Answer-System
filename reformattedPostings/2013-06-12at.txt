Homeowners are in negative equity when they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.   This is down from 10.5 million or 21.7% of all residential properties at the end of Q4 2012. Higher home prices helped lift 850,000 mortgage borrowers out of negative equity. But a large part of the country is still deep underwater. Using CoreLogic data, we ranked the 12 states that had the most underwater mortgages as a percentage of all mortgages. The five states with the highest negative equity accounted for 32.8% of negative equity in the U.S. Note: Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is a measure used by financial institutions to gauge risk before approving a mortgage. The higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk and the more expensive the loan.  FREE AppDownload
