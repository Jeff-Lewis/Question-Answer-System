Meanwhile, February's reading was revised up to reflect a more modest 0.5% monthly fall, and a 10% YoY fall. "The increase in March pending sales reverses only about half the drop over the previous three months," writes Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Home sales improved in three of four regions on a monthly basis: The index is considered to be a leading indicator for future existing home sales. "While March was much less stormy than Dec-Feb, it was the coldest month of the winter, relative to normal. The Mar reading points to existing home sales rising a bit to 4.7M in April from 4.59M in March," said Shepherdson. "We expect little further increase in home sales in Q2; the market is still digesting the biggest drop in affordability in 32 years." Existing home sales have been down 7.5% compared to a year ago, and the pace of sales is the slowest since June 2012. Higher mortgage rates, stricter lending conditions and the severe winter have weighed on the housing market. Many expect that the weakness in the housing market could be temporary.
