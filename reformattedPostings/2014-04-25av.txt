REUTERS/Mike StoneMichigan fans cheer before the start of the NCAA football game between the University of Alabama and the University of Michigan at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas September 1, 2012. The University of Michigan consumer confidence index jumped to 84.1 in April from 80.0 in March. This was the highest reading since July 2013. This was better than the 83.0 expected by economists and the 82.6 preliminary reading. The current economic conditions index climbed to 98.7, the highest level since July 2007. The consumer expectations index climbed to 74.7  from 70.0 a month ago. "While near term expectations have improved substantially, longer term expectations for personal finances as well as the overall economy have not improved as much,"said survey director Richard Curtin via Reuters. "We do not believe that a slower-than-expected recovery in the expectations component will weigh on economic activity, however, and we expect that the index of current conditions will continue to move higher as housing and labor markets improve," said Barclays' Cooper Howes.
