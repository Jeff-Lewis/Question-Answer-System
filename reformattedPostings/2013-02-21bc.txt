Bank of America Merrill LynchThere's no question that gold prices have been in a jaw-dropping long-term bull market for basically a hundred years. This has led some expert like George Soros to call it the "ultimate bubble." But with global central banks expanding the money supply as they embark on ultra-easy monetary policy, many gold bulls like Marc Faber and David Rosenberg have called for prices to go higher. There are also the ultra-bulls who think gold is headed for the stratosphere.  For whatever reason, they argue that it could be worth multiples of where it is today.  We've heard targets from $5,000 to $10,000. There's even a rationale for gold at $46,000/Oz. With prices plummeting, we thought it would be a good time to revisit some of the wildest gold price targets we've heard in the last year.
