APWhen the federal government shutdown finally came to an end in the middle of October, one of the provisions of the deal was the start of a budget conference between the House and Senate. Not many people thought the conference would lead to anything. But the two leaders on the 29-member bipartisan budget panel — Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are closing in on a small deal that could quiet down talks of another shutdown in January.  The deal is far from the elusive "grand bargain." According to congressional aides, here are some of the parameters of the ongoing negotiations: Both sides caution that the deal could still run into snags. Many Republicans think that the sequester cuts shouldn't be rolled back at all. Some Democrats are already pushing back at the talk of changes to the federal employee retirement program and the lack of an extension of unemployment benefits.  If a budget deal is not reached in the next few days, House Speaker John Boehner prefers, according to CNN, to move before Christmas recess a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at a $967 billion level, which keeps the sequestration cuts. Government funding expires on Jan. 15, the deadline that could trigger another shutdown.  FREE AppDownload
