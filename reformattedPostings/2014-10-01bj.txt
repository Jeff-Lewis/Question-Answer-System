The latest ISM manufacturing index came in at 56.6. Expectations were for the reading to come in at 58.5, down from August's 59.0. The latest report from ISM showed that all of the report's sub-indexes components are still showing growth, though the pace slowed for the headline index in September.  The prices paid sub-index rose 1.5% in September, while the employment sub-index fell 3.5%.  However, this conflicts with Markit's September US manufacturing PMI, which came in at 57.5. It came out shortly before the ISM report, and suggests that US manufacturing activity remains strong. Markit stated in the report: "September data pointed to another positive month for the US manufacturing sector, with strong rates of output and new orders growth underpinning the fastest expansion of payroll numbers for two-and-a-half years."
