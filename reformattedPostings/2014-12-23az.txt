Wikimedia CommonsThe US economy is growing. And that growth is being fueled by one key source: the American consumer. Tuesday dump of economic data featured a stronger-than-expected Q3 GDP revision, but also weaker-than-expected new home sales and durable goods reports. However, economists agree that consternation about those disappointing reports should be more than offset by the strength in consumer sentiment and personal spending. Americans are spending. And that consumption represents almost 70% of the economy. "This is literally shoot the lights out sort of stuff, and no smoke and mirrors and it is powered by the U.S. consumer with their spending," wrote Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's Chris Rupkey after the GDP report. Here are three stats from today's data dump reflecting this theme: "The suite of consumer sentiment, income, spending and prices suggest that Q4 spending will be solid," BNP Paribas' Bricklin Dwyer said. "The economy is heating up," Rupkey said. "Right now, even if consumers buy not a dime more in December, real consumer spending will be 4.2% even better than the 3.2% growth rate in the third quarter, the surprise upward revision of 1 percentage point we got at 8:30 this morning." And there's little doubt that consumers really are benefiting from lower gas prices. "Gasoline prices have been dropping so is this boosting consumption? Heck yes, it is going straight up," Rupkey said. Barclays, University of Michigan/Haver Analytics FREE AppDownload
