Europe is up nicely, with Italy gaining 0.56%, Germany up a tad, and Spain up over 1%. Spanish GDP just came out, and it only shrunk 0.1%, which is a moderation of the slowing. In Asia, China surged nearly 2%, and Japan gained just under 1%. It's going to be a slow day data-wise in the US. The only number is FHFA home prices. But since housing is the center of the most concern right now (since we've had a few weak datapoints lately) this will garner a fair bit of attention. FREE AppDownload
