Yesterday we pointed out that on the occasion of the Dow hitting 15,000, it was still clear that people still detested this stock market rally, based on the fact that everyone screams "RIGGED" or "PONZI" or "BERNANKE" on every uptick. This is the most hated rally of all time. Since the beginning of the recovery in 2009, people have been predicting its demise. But it's not just mouth-breathing comment-section trolls can't stand to see gains. Even the pros are still agitated, and are not enjoying at all Dow 15,000. Josh Brown notes in a tweet: So far, we've heard from Paul SInger, Kyle Bass and Li Lu - not one talking about a free-trading common stock you can buy. Bullish? #irasohn Paul Singer hates the Fed. Kyle Bass hates Japanese policy-makers. Sill nobody is happy or enjoying the good times. FREE AppDownload
