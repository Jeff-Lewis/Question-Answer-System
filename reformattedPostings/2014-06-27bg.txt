YouTube/Terence KawajaInvestment banker Terence Kawaja is a big-time player in the advertising technology field. His advisory firm, LUMA Partners, has worked to help companies like Google and Yahoo make multimillion-dollar acquisitions, and his industry knowledge makes him one of the tech world's most respected minds. He is also, it seems, something of a goof. Exhibit A: This four-minute music video Kawaja wrote and produced from the Cannes Lions advertising festival, a weeklong event where technology and advertising folks get together to give out awards, get drunk on yachts, and make deals with the Mediterranean Sea in the background. The video is set to the Pharrell song "Happy," and includes lyrics about the boozy festivities like "Out with your client on the Carlton deck. Your tab's expensed, so pick up the check." Here's Kawaja in his best Pharrell hat:YouTube/Terence Kawaja And because it's Cannes, the video features fancy lunches:YouTube/Terence Kawaja Incredible views:YouTube/Terence Kawaja And guys jumping off yachts:YouTube/Terence Kawaja Notable cameos include Undertone cofounder Eric Franchi, legendary angel investor Ron Conway, and Pinterest head of partnerships Joanne Bradford.  Here are the full lyrics: It might seem crazy what I'm about to sayCannes Lions is here, we can take a break There's so much more than just the Palais With the yachts, the parties and non-stop rose In Cannes we're happyClap along if you justified being here for your workIn Cannes we're happyClap along if you feel you deserve this annual perkIn Cannes we're happyClap along if you wouldn't miss this industry feteIn Cannes we're happyClap along if you enjoy serendipity on the Croisette Out with your client on the Carlton deckYour tab's expensed so pick up the checkWell I should probably warn you about the Gutter bar Packing in before dawn is the unwritten lawSing along In Cannes we're happyClap along if you make it through the day without a nap In Cannes we're happyClap along if you made the VIP list at Hotel du CapIn Cannes we're happyClap along if you cruised the Med on a big yacht with swank In Cannes we're happyClap along if you heli'd to lunch at Club 55 It's pronounced "Cannes"... not "Connes"It's pronounced "Cannes"... bien faire les chosesIt's pronounced "Cannes"... not "Connes"It's pronounced "Cannes"...
