The New York Times reported Takata had secretly conducted tests on 50 airbags retrieved from scrap yards after an accident in Alabama, with results showing cracks in steel inflators in two of the air bags. Citing two former Takata employees, The Times said Takata executives ordered the lab technicians to delete the test data instead of alerting federal safety regulators to the possible danger. Takata could not immediately be reached for comment. FREE AppDownload
