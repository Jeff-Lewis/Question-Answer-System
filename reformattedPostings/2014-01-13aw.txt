Today, the New York Fed published the inaugural results of its new monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations. The survey polls consumers about expectations for various things including inflation, house prices, and earnings growth. The data are useful because they break these responses down into various demographic groups, like age, education level, income bracket, and geographic region. As one might expect, the data show that those making more money are generally more optimistic on various aspects of the economy than those making less, and those with more education tend to be relatively more optimistic than their lesser-educated counterparts. What is perhaps most striking in the charts below, however, is the generational divide among American consumers — young people tend to have the highest expectations in many categories, while senior citizens have the lowest expectations. The charts below illustrate how different groups of consumers are feeling about different aspects of the economy at the moment.
