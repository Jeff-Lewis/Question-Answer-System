sirenmedia / FlickrThis week is the annual shareholder meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, the gigantic conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett. Buffett has a way of explaining complicated finance topics so that they're fun and understandable. Carleton English of Belus Capital Advisors points us to this gem of a quote from 2008 where he takes a jab at private equity. Someone had asked the Oracle of Omaha why people sell their companies to him instead of private equity firms. This is the type of question that you might hear later this week. Here's Buffett's response: 添ou can sell it to Berkshire, and we値l put it in the Metropolitan Museum; it値l have a wing all by itself; it値l be there forever. Or you can sell it to some porn shop operator, and he値l take the painting and he値l make the boobs a little bigger and he値l stick it up in the window, and some other guy will come along in a raincoat, and he値l buy it." According to Bloomberg, Buffett delivered this doozy during some Q&amp;A with a 300 executives in Toronto. He's basically explaining that there is more than one way for a company to get to a certain market value. Private equity often involves a lot of debt, a lot of cuts, and usually a lot of risk before a company is turned around and sold back on the market. Berkshire and Buffett, on the other hand, often take a more passive approach. Typically, Buffett seeks out what he considers to be undervalued, yet well run companies. And then he just waits for them to get to their intrinsic values. Anyways, we hope this weekend's events in Omaha yield some more great quotes. FREE AppDownload
