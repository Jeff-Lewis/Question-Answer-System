According to preliminary estimates from the New York City Independent Budget Office (IBO), New York City taxpayers are going to be shelling out a little more than $3.5 billion now that a fiscal cliff deal has been struck. Most of this is going to come out of the pockets of the city’s disproportionately large population of the very affluent, or those who make more than $500K. According to these stats, if you live in NYC and make between $250K-$500K, your tax bill is only going up by about $303. New York City Independent Budget Office Even though these new fiscal cliff taxes are supposed to affect those making $400K and up, New Yorkers making closer to the $400K number are probably not going to be affected all that much. That’s because already steep city and state taxes cut into the income taxable by the federal government, said Michael Jacobs, who put these stats together for the IBO. BUT, the limits on itemized deductions and personal exemptions that were phased out between 2006 and completely eliminated by 2010 are coming back, and are going to affect those making more than $250K-$300K adjusted gross income (depending on whether you file as a single person or as a couple). And, as James B. Stewart, a professor of business journalism at Columbia, explained in a column he wrote for the NYTimes last December, this is going to disproportionately affect affect “taxpayers in higher brackets who rely on earned income as opposed to investment income or an inheritance, who give to charity and live in a high-tax state(s)” like New York or California. So if you filed a bunch of such deductions in 2012, watch out, because your taxable income is about to go up. FREE AppDownload
