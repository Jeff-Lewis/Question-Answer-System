REUTERS/Svitzer/HandoutThe U.S. trade deficit widened to $42.3 billion in February from $39.3 billion in January. Economists were expecting the deficit to narrow to $38.5 billion. Exports fell $2.0 billion to $190.4 billion, but imports climbed $1.0 billion to $232.7 billion. "While we expect net trade to be a modest drag on domestic economic activity, the strong performance in consumer goods and auto demand can be seen as a signal of revival in domestic consumer spending activity after the weakness in the previous two months," said TD Securities Millan Mulraine. "Notwithstanding this, the weak performance in export activity, which has declined in two of the last three months suggests that the global environment has largely remained unsupportive to US economic activity." "The core non-oil Deficit ex-aircraft rose $1.2 billion, thanks mostly to an out-of-the-blue 2.1% leap in imports of services, worth $0.8 billion," noted Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson. "This appearsto reflect the payment of fees for broadcast rights to the Winter Olympics, so we expect a reversal in March."
