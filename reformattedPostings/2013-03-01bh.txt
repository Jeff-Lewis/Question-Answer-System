Some 660,000 people in China's Yunnan, Gansu and Hebei provinces have been impacted by a severe drought, according to China Daily.  The drought has affected 18.47 million mu (approx. 3 million acres) of farmland and has created a shortage of drinking water. This is the fourth-year in a row that Yunnan has faced such a severe drought. CCTV news spoke with villagers in Yuanmou County who said they last had rain four months ago. To cope, the villagers walk nearly 2 miles to get a bucket of water and have to make the trip up to three or four times a day, to get enough water to last them through just one day. The villagers told CCTV they have had to walk this distance to get water, for three years now.  Reuters A farmer walks past a dried up pond in Shilin Yi, in China's Yunnan province.
