Goldman SachsJan HatziusHere's Goldman's Jan Hatzius on that GDP report: On the investment side, while this is clearly a more weaker than expected number, there are a number of more forward looking indicators that are actually quite encouraging so we wouldn’t be too worried abt this particular number. Also weaker residential investment -7.9% in the fourth quarter, certainly fairly meaningful when taken cumulatively. Overall somewhat weaker than expected – nothing here that would really change our forward looking outlook significantly. Still think growth will be stronger in coming quarters – forecast for second quarter is 3%, feel broadly okay about that despite this negative surprise.
