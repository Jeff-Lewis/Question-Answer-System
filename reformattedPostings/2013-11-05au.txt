Kmeron via FlickrUber CEO Travis Kalanick Whether it’s founding the world’s first P2P search engine, or developing the premier enterprise content delivery system, Kalanick believes that every problem has a solution. He’s guided red-hot startup Uber ($3.4B valuation) from a niche market in San Francisco to its global presence today. Uber's plans go well beyond luxury rides. Its goal is to become an "instant gratification" service that gives people what they need, when they need it, whether that's a ride or some other delivery.  Along the way, Kalanick has actively invested in and advised other passionate startup entrepreneurs. Somehow he’s also managed to rack up the second highest Wii Tennis score in the world. Take a ride with Kalanick at IGNITION: Future of Digital, BI's flagship event November 11-13 at New York’s Time Warner Center. He’ll be talking with BI Editor-in-Chief Henry Blodget about entrepreneurship, building a brand, and much more.
