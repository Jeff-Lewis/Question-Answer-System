AP The U.S. Treasury has announced the names of 18 Russian citizens who will have sanctions imposed on them under the Magnitsky Act. According to the wording of the act, the people listed are "persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, for the conspiracy to defraud the Russian Federation of taxes on corporate profits through fraudulent transactions and lawsuits against Hermitage, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation, and for other purposes." Magnitsky was a Moscow-based lawyer for investment fund, Hermitage Capital, who became notorious after allegedly uncovering massive tax fraud. He died under suspicious circumstances while serving jail time in 2009. Those on the list will face visa bans and have assets frozen under the law. The list has been widely referred to as a "blacklist". Vladimir Putin's Russian government had repeatedly warned that the list would damage relations. There has even been talk of a blacklist of US officials with links to Guantanamo Bay in response. However, the list is far shorter than the Kremlin may have feared, and does not include some of the big names that had reportedly been targeted. There had been speculation that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov would be on the list, but his name does not appear, and no-one close to Putin was named. Josh Rogin at Foreign Policy points out that 16 of the names relate directly to the Magnitsky case. Two of the names — Letscha Bogatirov and Kazbek Dukuzov — are Chechen police officers who have been linked to human rights abuses. The names are as follows: FREE AppDownload
