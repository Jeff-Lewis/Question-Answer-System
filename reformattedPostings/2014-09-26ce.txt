Morningstar, Business InsiderPIMCO's flagship Total Return Fund saw $3.9 billion in net outflows in August, according to Morningstar. That was the 16th straight month of net outflows for a cumulative total amount of about $68 billion. This is part of the legacy that CIO Bill Gross leaves behind as he heads to Janus Capital. PIMCO has attracted a lot of attention in recent months, largely because of the unexpected departure of CEO Mohamed El-Erian and revelations of Gross's unorthodox management style. Despite the outflows, PIMCO's fund continues to be massive with $221.6 billion in assets under management as of Aug. 31. FREE AppDownload
