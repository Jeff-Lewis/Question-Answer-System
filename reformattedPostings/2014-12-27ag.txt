There are dozens upon dozens of different styles of beer out there, from pale ales to stouts to bocks — and those are just a few. Being that there are so many styles, and so many exceptions to the rules, it's incredibly difficult (not to mention time-consuming) to get to know them all, but knowing your favorites will make drinking them a lot more enjoyable. We've created a taxonomy of most major beer styles to help you put your favorite cold ones into context. Start in the center and see where each style of beer falls. Skye Gould/Business Insider
