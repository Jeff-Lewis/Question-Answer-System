REUTERS/Brendan McDermidA mascot dressed as a character from the mobile game "Candy Crush Saga" walks the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the IPO of Mobile game maker King Digital Entertainment Plc March 26, 2014. King Digital, the company behind Candy Crush, just reported its first quarterly earnings as a public company. The numbers look pretty good, but King's stock is suffering. It's currently trading down 10.39% at $16.81 a share. King priced its IPO at $22.50 a share. Revenue increased to $607 million, which beat FactSet's estimate of $602 million. Gross bookings were $641.1 million, which is up from the previous quarter of $632 million. EPS was $0.61 versus analyst estimates of $0.57. Monthly active users were 481 million, up from the previous quarter which had 408 million monthly active users. Daily active users were also up: 143 million versus 124 million the quarter before. While the numbers are solid, King's stock could be tanking due to one important detail: The number of people paying for in-app power-ups is in decline. King has 11.9 million “unique payers,” down from 12.2 million in Q4. King hit its peak in Q3 with 13 million "unique payers." Meanwhile, its forward-looking statements, which include a bunch of risk factors. Here's a key nugget: "The fact that a relatively small number of games continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenue and gross bookings, and declines in popularity of these games could harm our financial results." King also notes that it relies heavily on third-party platforms and their popularity. Investors were also worried about the company's growth. Revenue in Q4 was down from its Q3 revenue. This quarter, as we noted, revenue is up sequentially, but it's still not as high as it was in Q3.  King    FREE AppDownload
