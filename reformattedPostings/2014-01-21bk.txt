REUTERS/ Edgard GarridoStrapped for cash amid the financial crisis, the New York Times struck a deal with the world's second-richest man, mobile-phone magnate Carlos Slim, who made a $250 million investment. That bought the Times some time — it didn't have to hawk chunks of its business as both newspapering and the economy at large crumbled fast.  It wasn't exactly like Slim needed the cash, but it turned out to be a pretty sweet deal for him. Bloomberg's Edmund Lee reports that Slim's profit from the loan stands at $263 million when you factor in interest, premiums, and warrants. From Bloomberg: [Slim] already has earned $122 million from his loan to the Times, based on an annual interest rate of 14 percent and a 12 percent premium charged to the company when its debt to Slim was redeemed in 2011. Under the terms of the loan, the Times still owes Slim additional shares worth as much as $141 million based on the Jan. 17 stock price, thanks to options he received to buy shares at what is now a deep discount.
