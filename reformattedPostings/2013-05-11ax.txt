"People who claim that natural gas will spark a broad-based U.S. economic renaissance, if only pesky environmentalists lay off, are exaggerating the benefits of the shale gas bonanza," he writes. He's not alone — we recently told you about the note from Capital Economics' Paul Dales, who says, "The boom in domestic energy production is responsible for only a small part of the rise in GDP since the recession and it does not explain why the US has outperformed most of its closest competitors." We've compiled just a few charts that demonstrate why, outside of the energy industry itself, we're probably not going to see all that big of a spill-over effect from shale oil and gas production into the broader economy.
