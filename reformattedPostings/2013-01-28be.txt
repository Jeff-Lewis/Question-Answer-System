Meggings are so last year.  Metropolitan men in Europe and the U.S. are rushing to buy "mantyhose," which are tights for men.  “It’s definitely become a trend for men in Europe. It’s fun for them to wear, and you can see the color and patterns standing out [from] their shoes...They wear the tights with shorts, under jeans that have holes, under pants to stay warm in colder climates, or just to lounge around,” Designer Lisa Cavallini told Women's Wear Daily. “The interest is also growing in the U.S. market, and we’ve had so many requests for mantyhose that we’ve added an extra-large size for men who are 6 feet tall and weigh up to 198 pounds.” Lisa is the daughter of legendary menswear designer Emilio Cavallini and runs his namesake brand. The Emilio Cavallini tights retail for $40 and come in prints including barbed-wire, dots, and crossword puzzle.  A website called mantyhose.net offered a few tips for men looking to capitalize on the trend.  DON'T MISS: Jos.
