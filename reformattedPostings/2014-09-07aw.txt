Boeing NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co&gt; and Ryanair Holdings PLC plan to make a significant fleet announcement on Monday, following reports last Friday that the low-cost Irish airline was poised to place a $10 billion order for Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner. Boeing Chief Executive Ray Conner and Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary will make the announcement at a meeting Monday morning in New York, Boeing said on Sunday. Boeing declined to comment on details of the announcement. Ryanair declined to comment. On Friday, Reuters reported that Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, was in advanced talks to order at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliners, modified to include 11 extra seats, bringing total seating in the new plane up to 200. One source told Reuters the order could be for as many as 150 of the jets. A deal for 100 jets would be worth about $10.4 billion, at the 737 MAX 8's list price of $104 million, but airlines usually negotiate steep discounts, particularly on large orders. Ryanair's order, if confirmed, would mark another major win for Boeing's 737 MAX program, which has garnered 2,219 orders since its launch in 2011.  (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall) (Editing by Sonya Hepinstall) FREE AppDownload
