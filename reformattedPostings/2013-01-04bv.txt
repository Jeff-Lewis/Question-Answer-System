Screenshot via CNBCThe February 2013 edition of Bloomberg Markets Magazine features its ranking of the top 100 large hedge fund managers in the world. Unlike last year when the most successful hedge funds were a variety of strategies — long/short, macro etc. — this year's success stories mostly come from the world of mortgage bonds. This strategy provided an average return of 20.2 percent in 2012, far outpacing the industry average of 1.3 percent. The tiny average return was also far worse than the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which provided a double-digit return in 2012. Bloomberg reports 635 hedge funds closed due to these poor returns through September. The hedge fund managers listed here, though, are far from closing up shop — some of them even manage multiple successful funds. In 2012, they dominated the market with returns ranging from 9 to 37.8 percent. Big thanks to Bloomberg Markets Magazine for permission to use their information. FREE AppDownload
