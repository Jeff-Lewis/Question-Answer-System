WOW. The UK Services PMI Index just blew the doors off. The index is up from 60.2 to 60.5. That's the highest in 6.5 years. From Markit: Key Points: Summary: August’s survey of UK service providers signalled  continued strong growth of activity and new  business. Activity rose at the sharpest pace since  December 2006, while growth in new work was the  best seen since May 1997.  Capacity continued to be tested, with backlogs of  work rising at the sharpest pace for over 13 years.  However, employment broadly stagnated, in part  due to an inability of service providers to replace  leavers.
