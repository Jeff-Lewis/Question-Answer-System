Ralph Orlowski/ReutersTwo Russian multimillionaires racked up a £130,000 ($207,116) bill between them in a head-to-head contest to see who could amass the biggest bar tab. The men got into a spending competition last night during the Amsterdam-themed special event at private members club Kitsch, which opened last Wednesday. They began by ordering high-end champagne bottles Dom Perignon and Cristal, in order to match each other. Around 2.40am when the tabs were paid, the bills stood at £66,778.91 and £64,279.70, totalling £131,058.61. Service charge alone came in at over £8,000 per bill.

The victorious clubber jumped up and down waving his receipt while the bills were added up in the early hours of the morning at the nightclub in Old Burlington Street, London. Kitsch could not reveal the identity of the millionaires. "It was one of the most bizarre nights I've ever seen.
