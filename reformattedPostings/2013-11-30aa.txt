We spoke with the author — Emory sophomore Jonathan Weiss — and put together our own Fraternity Fashion Guide. Weiss helped us determine some do's and don'ts for the well-dressed frat boy. Inside, you'll find tips on how to dress for any occasion — formals, date nights, class, or parties. You'll also find some advice directly from the Fratshionistau, such as this gem about how to best pull off a semi-formal look: "Simplicity stands out! Busy designs on shirts or ties are distracting. A solid white shirt with a solid colored tie, or a basic pattern, is always the easiest way to go." FREE AppDownload
