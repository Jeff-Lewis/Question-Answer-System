Shares of Herbalife are ripping today with the nutrition supplement seller's stock last trading up more than 8% at $48 per share. We haven't seen any news on the stock, yet. Herbalife is one of the most controversial stocks and it has generated a great deal of dicussion on both the long and short side.   Back in December, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, publicly announced that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of the stock. Ackman believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" and has a price target of $0.  Not everyone has agreed with him, though.  Ackman's rival Carl Icahn snapped up a massive stake in Herbalife.  Icahn owns more than 16 million shares of Herbalife.   The stock is trading well above the level when Ackman revealed his short at a special Sohn Conference event in mid-December.   Here's a chart:  Yahoo!
