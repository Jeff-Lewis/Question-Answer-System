Total annual compensation for the top 301 CEOs in America increased by a median 5.5% to $11.4 million from 2012 to 2013. The top 10% of earners made 23% of the total compensation, according to the report. Meanwhile, wages and salaries for private sector employees in the U.S. increased by 1.8% during the same period, a growth discrepancy also indicative of a trend since the recession. Notably, none of the CEOs in the top 10 lead companies ranked in the top 10% for performance. Larry Ellison is the highest paid CEO in the U.S., but Oracle ranks as No. 152 in performance. Similarly, Disney CEO Robert Iger is the sixth highest paid, but the company's performance ranks at No. 165. Total direct compensation consists of salary, annual incentives, stock option grants, restricted stock grants, and performance awards. Most of those in the top 10 made their money from stock options and cash.
