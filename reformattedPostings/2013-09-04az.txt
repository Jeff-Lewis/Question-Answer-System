This year, more than thirty private high schools in the U.S. are charging more than $40,000 in tuition, with the most expensive reaching almost $45,000 — more expensive than many colleges.  But with premium costs come premium perks like iPads, state-of-the-art athletic and learning facilities, and clubs for every interest imaginable. We calculated the most expensive private schools based on day student tuition plus mandatory fees (including one-time fees, where listed). Boarding-only schools and schools for students with special needs were not included. If you think we missed a school, tell us in the comments and we'll check it out. FREE AppDownload
