GettyPresident Barack Obama's approval rating has hit a three-plus-year high, while the approval rating of Congressional Republicans has sunk to a corresponding low, according to a new poll from Bloomberg.  The poll shows that Obama's approval rating has jumped to 55 percent, its highest point since September 2009 in Bloomberg's tracking. Meanwhile, only 35 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of Congressional Republicans, the lowest since September 2009. Meanwhile, a new Pew Research Center poll finds similar numbers — Obama's approval rating sits at 51 percent, while only 25 percent of respondents approved of Congressional Republicans.

Obama and Republicans have spent the early part of the week battling over the cuts, as each side attempts to swing public opinion to its side before the cuts take effect. These two surveys foreshadowed that Republicans will be to blame if the sequester goes into effect.  Here are some numbers from both polls that show why: The Pew poll finds that across party lines, a vast majority of Americans — 70 percent — want Congress to pass major legislation to reduce the budget deficit.
