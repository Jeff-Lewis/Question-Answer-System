China's exports and imports of goods amounted to $4.16 trillion in 2013, topping the U.S. for the first time. A new Standard Chartered report by Madhur Jha and other Standard Chartered economists, titled "Global Trade Unbundled," highlights just how much of a trading giant China has become.  "China is a true mega-trader — a position last held by colonial Britain, with trade significant not only as a share of world trade (11.5%) but also of its own GDP (47%)," according to Jha. "China will likely become a champion of free trade." The U.S. is China's top export destination. China's trade with Latin America has risen more than 200 times since 1990 and is the fastest-growing corridor. China's trade is beginning to slow, however. Exports accounted for about 25% of GDP in 2012, down from 35% in 2007. And the slowdown is broad based. The good news is despite the slowdown, exports to Latin America and Africa are still growing at "double-digit levels." Jha and the other authors identity a few reasons they think China will continue to be a leader of world trade. Standard Chartered economists expect Chinese trade to double in size by 2020. "China’s trade growth is unlikely to rebound to the double-digit level seen over the last couple of decades. However, it is important to remember that the sheer size of China’s trade will mean that even 7% GDP growth, faster than the growth in developed world trade, would make China the single biggest contributor to world trade in absolute terms." Here's a look at the China's major trade corridors in 1990 and 2012. Standard Chartered
