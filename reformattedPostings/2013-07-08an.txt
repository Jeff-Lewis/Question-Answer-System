Credit jumped by $19.6 billion in May to $2.838 trillion, which was far higher than the $12.5 billion forecasted by economists. Revolving credit (e.g. credit card balances) jumped by $6.6 billion to $856.5 billion. Non-revolving credit (e.g. mortgages, auto loans) grew $13.0 billion to $1,982 trillion. Growth in April, however, was revised down to $10.8 billion from an earlier reading of  $11.05 billion gain in April. "As households have made significant progress in repairing their balance sheets, consumers have been more willing and able to take on additional credit," said Wells Fargo's John Silvia ahead of the release. "The Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that banks on net have been increasingly willing to make loans to consumers in the second quarter and are loosening standards."
