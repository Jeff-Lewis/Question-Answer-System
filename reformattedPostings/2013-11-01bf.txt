The ING New York City Marathon is this weekend and thousands of runners will descend on the streets of New York City and the surrounding buroughs. Among these competitors we'd expect to find some recognizable Wall Street names. So in the spirit of the 26.2 mile race, we've decided to do a little digging and find the best running times for some of the biggest players in the financial services industry.  It turns out that Credit Suisse's CEO Brady Dougan, 53, is a really good long distance runner. He ran a marathon a few years ago averaging a mile pace of 7:43.  We also learned that Dougan was a cross-country runner in high school.  (See photo below).  JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon finished a half marathon earlier this year.  Goldman's Edith Cooper also did a half marathon this year and she was 20 minutes faster than the JPMorgan chief.  Below we've included a round up of marathon, half marathon, half Ironman, 10K and 5K times courtesy of Athlinks.com.  Check it out:  Marathon (26.2 miles): Hillcrest High School yearbook Brady Dougan running cross country in high school  Half Ironman (70.3 mile swim, bike, run): Half Marathon (13.1 miles):  10Ks:  5Ks:  FREE AppDownload
