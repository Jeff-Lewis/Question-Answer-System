BofA Merrill Lynch technical analysts Stephen Suttmeier and Xue Jiong see two "triple bearish divergences" emerging in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 rolls over from new all-time highs made after last Wednesday's shock FOMC decision to refrain from tapering back quantitative easing. The first divergence can be seen clearly in the chart below. As the S&amp;P 500 continues to make higher highs, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks above their respective 200-day moving averages is making lower highs. "Both the S&amp;P 500 and percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks above 200-day moving averages have stalled at key trend line resistances," write the analysts in a note to clients. "Lower tops for the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks above 200-day moving averages and higher highs for the S&amp;P 500 is a triple negative divergence." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg The second triple bearish divergence is in price momentum indicators – specifically the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). "The S&amp;P 500 has three higher highs, while weekly MACD and RSI remain in downtrends off those S&amp;P 500 highs – this is a potential triple bearish divergence," say the BAML analysts. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg The bottom line: "This sets up triple negative divergences. With overbought short-term indicators, the risk is S&amp;P 500 resistance near 1728-41 holds for now." FREE AppDownload
