www.abc6.comThree people are being questioned in the Boston suburb of New Bedford, Mass., in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings suspect, according to multiple reports. WBSH-AM, a New Bedford station, and Fox News report that local and state police and FBI agents searched suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. That led them to an apartment complex in New Bedford's West End, where they took two men and one woman into custody for questioning. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the woman is Dzhokar's girlfriend. According to Reuters' Edith Honan, the development comes "on the assumption there is an affiliation" with Dzhokar Tsarnaev.
