bobolink / FlickrHousing starts missed expectations falling 9.9% month-over-month to an annualized pace of 836,000. Economists were looking for the pace of starts to climb 5.0% to 960,000 annualized.

Meanwhile permits were revised up as well, to show a more modest 2% fall to 985,000. It is possible that homebuilders were spooked by the rise in mortgage rates.
