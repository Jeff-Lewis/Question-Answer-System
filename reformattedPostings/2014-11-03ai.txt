Five years ago, Dalene and Peter Heck were toiling in cushy, lucrative corporate jobs in Alberta, Canada. Life was good, if monotonous. Then came a deluge of personal trials, family illnesses, and tragic accidents.  The Hecks had a realization: Life is short and you have to make the most of it. The two made the radical decision to quit their jobs, sell their possessions, and embark on a life of travel.  They booked a flight to South America with no real plan, except that they would start by using their savings to fund their travels. They had no idea how or if they would be able to make their hoped-for life of 24/7 travel sustainable. Five years later, they’ve taught English in Turkey, lived near a volcano in Ecuador, kayaked in Scandinavia, and nearly been swept off a mountain in Peru. They started a blog along the way, Hecktic Travels, which is bursting with gorgeous photos of the many places they’ve been and fun anecdotes from their tribulations on the road. While they initially thought travel blogging might be a way to fund their adventures, they quickly found it to be time-consuming and poorly paid. So they started Hektic Media, which connects travel brands with travel bloggers. The new enterprise has been a far more lucrative endeavor. “Travel blogging is the wild west in many ways. We know a lot of people that do good work and we meet a lot of companies that want to work with them, but they don’t know where to start. We help connect the two and help manage entire campaigns,” explains Dalene Heck. The couple was recently named the Travelers of the Year by National Geographic.   FREE AppDownload
