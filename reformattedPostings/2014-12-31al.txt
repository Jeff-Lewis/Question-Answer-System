Five years ago, in January 2010, I decided to take a picture of myself every day for an entire year. I did this for a few reasons: boredom, narcissism, a lifelong fondness for weird and unnecessary projects. But I also realized that much of my adult life had gone undocumented. My parents have countless photo albums of themselves in  their 20s and 30s. I have a bunch of pictures from a beard and mustache festival in 2003. And I wasn’t even in the festival! I started using my MacBook to take a self-portrait every day. OK, not every single day without fail, because it didn’t occur to me at the time that it would sound way more impressive if my commitment was totally unwavering. But I took a photo pretty much every day, and once the year was up I kept on going. Why not? Taking one of these pictures took only a couple of seconds per day, and it always gave me a small sense of accomplishment. On days when I was struggling to do my work, I knew that I could always check “take photo” off my daily action list, and it always felt good. I suggest that you start your day with something similarly pointless and easy to accomplish. After a couple of years, despite my best efforts, this project started to feel meaningful. Not real-world meaningful, but personally meaningful—or at least something with the possibility of becoming personally meaningful. I had always enjoyed those time-lapse videos, ones with titles like “Man Takes Photo of Himself Every Day for Eight Years in Incredible Video.” Maybe if I stuck with the project long enough, I would have enough material for a video of my own, one that would deliver some sort of insight into my life.
