During his speech to mark the end of the Debt Ceiling standoff, President Obama identified three things that should be addressed right away to fix the economy. Here they are: 1 We should pursue a balanced approach to a Federal budget. Basically, he wants to come up with a long-term budget plan that ease long-term burdens while not imposing much austerity now. 2 We should fix immigration. He says this will add significantly to GDP. 3 Passing a farm bill. The Senate has already passed a bill to provide stable laws and subsidies. He noted that there's a lot more he'd like to see, but that he feels these are areas where the government can get stuff done. For more on Obamas speech, see here. FREE AppDownload
