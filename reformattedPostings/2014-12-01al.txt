Kaufman PhotographyAfter five years on and off the market, former Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis has finally sold a beach house he owns in a private community in Spring Island, South Carolina, the Wall Street Journal reports. The home sold at a loss: Lewis had purchased it in 2002 for $3 million, and wound up selling for "close to" its current asking price of $2.495 million, the listing agent told the Journal. Lewis, who left the bank at the end of 2009, had slashed the price on the vacation home several times. He co-owned the home along with Dennis Thompson, the founder and CEO of Charlotte, N.C.-based restaurant operator Firebirds International. The pad has three bedrooms, marsh views, and was once featured in Architectural Digest.
