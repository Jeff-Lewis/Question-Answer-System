We discovered that the Facebook app for the iPhone is taking up way too much space on your phone. The video above explains in much more depth and tells you how to solve the problem, but it's still annoying. Update: Facebook sent us additional information on how it's addressing the problem: "Photos and videos account for most of the data we store, and we made a recent update to get smarter about when to delete old photos from the device that aren’t being used anymore. We also made an update in v18 of our app to clear out cached web pages after the web page cache reaches 25 megabytes." Produced by Matthew Stuart. Special thanks to Matt Johnston.
