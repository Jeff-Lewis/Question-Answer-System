REUTERS/Mark Blinch Jobless claims hit 317,000. Consensus was for 310,000, down slightly from a revised 313,000 prior. Continuing claims also climbed more than expected, reaching 2,614,000 against a consensus estimate of 2,605,000, and 2,603,000 prior. "In one line: Seasonal quirk explains the increase; expect a clear drop next week," Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson said. "The seasonal adjustment for this week is so unfavorable that we마re quite pleased by this number; it could easily have been significantly higher. The seasonal quirk should reverse next week, pushing claims down towards the 300K mark. The underlying trend말n claims is still falling, albeit quite slowly, but the decline마lready recorded this year is more than enough to suggest that 맗ayroll gains of 225K-plus ought to be sustainable, other things만qual."
