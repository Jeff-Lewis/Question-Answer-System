Output rose by only 0.1% from September to October, and 0.7% year-on-year. Analysts were expecting a 0.2% increase on the month, and a 0.6% increase from October last year. But that was before we got the grim figures on industrial production from Europe's three biggest economies this month.  This week, data showed Germany's output for October up by 0.2%, disappointing analysts who expected a 0.4% rise, Italian production fell by 0.1%, despite expectations for a 0.3% rise, and French production plunged 0.8%.  FREE AppDownload
