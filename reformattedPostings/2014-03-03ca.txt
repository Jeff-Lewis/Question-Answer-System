University of Sydney A study by University of Sydney researchers produced this map showing the flow of jobs and wages around the world. In Australia’s case, China has 5 million people just to make goods for Australians. The workers, on low wages, support Australia’s lifestyle. For example, a computer bought in Australia (average domestic wage US$59,700) might be assembled in China (average domestic wage $US2,700) and Thailand ($US2,100) using electronic circuits made in the Philippines ($US1,700). Other examples: French people (average domestic wage, US$58,000) smoke cigars manufactured in Poland (average domestic wage, US$10,000) which relies on raw material produced in Tanzania (average domestic wage, US$170). In turn, Tanzania imports computers produced in China and designed in the United States. In 2010, about 500,000 labourers in Tanzania worked to support US consumption (earned $215 million), whereas approximately 3,000 labourers in the United States worked for Tanzania (and earned $50 million). Americans (average domestic wage, $58,000) love their cotton clothes. These are manufactured in China (average domestic wage, US$2,700) and woven from yarn in Pakistan (average domestic wage, US$1,460) made with raw cotton from Tajikistan (average domestic wage, US$450). The research paper, The Employment Footprints of Nations Uncovering Master-Servant Relationships, was published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology.
