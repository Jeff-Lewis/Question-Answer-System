DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday he was confident he could renegotiate his country's relations with the European Union to allow it to remain in the 28-nation bloc. "I'm confident that we'll have a successful renegotiation and a successful referendum," he told delegates, referring to his plan to reshape his country's EU ties before offering Britons an in/out referendum if he is re-elected next year. "I'm confident this is do-able, deliverable and, as I say, winnable for Britain to stay in a reformed European Union," he said.
