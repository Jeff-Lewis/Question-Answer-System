BloombergJoachim FelsCentral banks around the world continue to embrace easy monetary policy in its efforts to stimulate their local economies. Morgan Stanley's economics team has dubbed the moves since February as "the Great Monetary Easing, Part Three," or GME3. "I am surprised by the breadth of the move that we have seen recently," said Joachim Fels, Morgan Stanley's Global Head of Economics.  "In the last ten trading days we've seen the Fed tweak its language and we've had rate cuts from the ECB, Poland, India, Korea and Australia. So the breadth of the move has been surprising." "Now, what explains the moves? I think there are three global factors: 1) Japan had a big monetary easing announced in early April, so Japan is exporting deflation via its exchange rate. And I think other central banks wanted to buy insurance against that. 2) The global soft patch has been unfolding for the last month or two. 3) I think we're seeing globally synchronized disinflation largely caused by lower commodity prices. So I think these reasons explain why central banks have now behaved as one." Morgan Stanley's David Adelman sums up six points to keep in mind considering the backdrop of GME3. FREE AppDownload
