This weekend Omaha, Nebraska will be flooded with people for what is locally known as "Berkshire Weekend," when Warren Buffett hosts his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at the company's headquarters. Since Buffett is "The Oracle of Omaha" this party is a blowout — We're talking country fair, smorgasbord, extravaganza with a value investing twist. To attend, you must be a Berkshire shareholder (or a journalist). They come in droves, filling the massive CenturyLink Center Arena to hear Buffett's wisdom, suck on Dilly bars, play bridge, and eat steak. Business Insider reached out to some people who have attended the meeting in years past to get an idea of what it's like, and more importantly, to get a sense of who makes the pilgrimage out to this mid-western Mecca. A 2011 Shareholder Meeting attendee broke it down for us. He said there are three kinds of people that go to Warren Buffett's Americana extravaganza, we dug up a fourth. You can check out the list of activities here, but the event goes far beyond what's on this document. Attendees and locals often use the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Meeting as an opportunity to throw events all over town — book signings, cocktails parties etc. Jealous yet? FREE AppDownload
