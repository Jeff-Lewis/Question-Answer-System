Pretax profit in the investment banking division fell by more than a fifth, dragged down by a 10 percent fall in trading income, the bank said in a statement. The division includes Deutsche Bank's main trading unit - fixed income, currencies and commodities, or FICC. Deutsche Bank had been expected to post quarterly pretax profit of 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion), around 1 billion less than a year earlier, according to the average result of a Reuters poll. This version of the story changes 'revenue' to 'pretax profit' in second para. (Reporting by Thomas Atkins; Editing by Noah Barkin) FREE AppDownload
