AP PhotoPreet Bharara U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's perfect track record in insider trading convictions just got ruined. Today, Rengan Rajaratnam, the younger brother of ex-Galleon Group chief Raj Rajaratnam, just got acquitted of a conspiracy charge in an insider trading case, the Wall Street Journal reports. Since th government's massive insider trading crackdown began in 2009, Bharara—also known as "The Sheriff Of Wall Street"—had a perfect record of 81-0 for convictions. "While we are disappointed with the verdict on the sole count that the jury was permitted to consider, we respect the jury trial system whatever the outcome, and we thank the jury for their service. This Office maintains its faith in the criminal justice system, a system that has resulted in the convictions by trial or guilty plea of 85 other defendants on insider trading charges. We will continue to seek justice in the investigation and prosecution of those who violate the securities laws of the United States," Bharara said in a statement.  In 2011, Rengan's brother Raj Rajaratnam was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for orchestrating a massive insider trading scheme. Rengan worked at Galleon Group.  FREE AppDownload
