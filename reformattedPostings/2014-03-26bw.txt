REUTERS/Tobias SchwarzFebruary U.S. durable goods orders data are out. Total orders rose 2.2% in February after falling a downwardly-revised 1.3% in January, beating consensus estimates for a 0.8% rise. Orders of durable goods excluding transportation items advanced only 0.2% in February — missing estimates for a 0.3% rise — after recording a downwardly-revised 0.9% gain in January. Orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a measure also referred to as "core capex," fell 1.3%. Economists predicted core capex would rise 0.5%. January's 1.7% gain was revised down to 0.8%. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 0.5% — missing the 0.8% consensus estimate — and January's 0.8% drop was revised to a 1.4% drop. "To be sure, the core durables data has been understating the recovery in business equipment spending because imports of capital goods have been climbing and some of business investment gets booked into R&amp;D and intellectual property," says Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro. "Be that as it may, it is difficult to see how this lasts. First, most models of investment point to an accelerator effect. As growth improves investment rises more. So, if GDP is likely to pick up in Q2, investment will rise some multiple of that. Second, productivity is low and failing to invest in a depleted capital stock will put future corporate profitability at risk." Click here for the full release » FREE AppDownload
