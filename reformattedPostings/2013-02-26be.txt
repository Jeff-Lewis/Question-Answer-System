William Thomas Cain/Getty ImagesThis morning we saw two positive housing data points. Home prices increased at their fastest pace since July 2006, and new home sales data showed that housing supply continues to be tight.

Here is a look at what some of them are doing: Toll Brothers is up 3 percent. DR Horton America's largest homebuilder is up 3.5 percent. Beazer Homes is up 2.3 percent. PulteGroup is up 4.5 percent. Standard Pacific Corp which builds single-family attached and detached homes is up nearly 7 percent. FREE AppDownload
