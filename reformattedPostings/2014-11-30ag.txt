Gold is getting smoked. On Sunday night, gold was down more than 4% to as low as $1,143 an ounce after voters in Switzerland on Sunday rejected a measure that would have required the Swiss National Bank to increase its gold reserves to 20% of its holdings from 8%. The vote failed by a margin of 78% to 22%. In addition to the drop in gold, crude oil prices are resuming their tumble, and the price of other precious metals — silver and platinum — were also down sharply.  Silver futures were down 12% early Sunday night, and platinum futures were down more than 3%. Copper prices were also lower by 4% in what is a rough night for the metals markets. Here are the ugly gold and silver charts. FinViz FinViz FREE AppDownload
