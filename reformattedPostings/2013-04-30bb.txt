Here at Business Insider, we're trying to let them know a little something about how real it is, and hand out some advice. This nugget comes from Anthony Scaramucci, a managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, an asset management firm with $7.1 billion under management. "The Mooch" as he's known, has admitted that he may not have been the wisest young banker when he started at Goldman Sachs — he played "chicken" with his Series 7 exam, for example. But he survived, and with a clear idea of what he wishes he'd known then (which is key). "I wish I had read Andrew Carnegie's autobiography and not waited until my 25th year on Wall Street," he told Business Insider. Carnegie "understood human nature and tried to make a positive lasting impact." That's not all. Carnegie, in case you're not familiar, came from nothing. When he was a young boy in Scotland during the 1840s, he and his family would go to bed early to forget how hungry they were. By the 1870s, he'd immigrated to the United States and made Carnegie Steel into a powerhouse company of the Industrial Revolution. The rest is great American history. It's an inspiring rags to richest story. And perhaps Scaramucci relates, in part, because of what he was wearing during his first interview at Goldman Sachs. "I was wearing polyester everything," said Scaramucci. "Black polyester suit, a thin black Guido tie, a white on white polyester shirt, if you know what that means, and narrow Capezio cockroach killer shoes. My interviewer took me aside and told me,'You are the worst dressed kid I've met at this school...' I was mortified because I thought I looked fantastic!" FREE AppDownload
