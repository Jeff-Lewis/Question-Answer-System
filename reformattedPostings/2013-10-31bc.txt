foursquare Kino W.It's Halloween, so a number of you, both Wall Streeters and civilians, will want to go out and have a good time tonight. So consider this a public service announcement. New York is a big, bad city with tons of options for entertainment. And when there's plenty of choice, that means many of those choices can be... obnoxious. Click here to see the bars&gt; Wall Street bars are no exception to this rule, in fact, these bars have their own way of being annoying, off-putting, and sometimes gross. The danger is that 'Wall Street' is not a geographical boundary here, these are simply bars that attract Wall Streeters (though they're generally in Midtown and the Financial District). So anyone could easily stumble into one completely unawares. To mitigate our own risk, some time ago we surveyed our readers about where Wall Street goes to be their worst selves. Then we did some investigating ourselves. What did we find? Think: Uber preps, frat-tastic kids just out of college, girls who can't stop screaming (woooooo!), and music that is banned in most tasteful establishments (Shania Twain anyone?). Enter these bars at your own peril. FREE AppDownload
