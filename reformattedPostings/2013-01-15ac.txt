Everyone talking about the debt ceiling and the idea that the Treasury could engage in "prioritization" (honoring some obligations, while not honoring others, so as to maintain a balanced budget and not breach the debt ceiling), needs to see these 9 tweets from Tony Fratto, a former Treasury official under the Bush administration. The gist: There is NO obvious way to simply "prioritize" payments. The revenue is too lumpy. A default is a real possibility. And there's no alternative to raising the debt ceiling. GREAT stuff. (1) Treasury makes huge regular payments at the beginning of the month -- like for Social Security and federal retirement benefits. (2) While tax revenues tend to come in during the middle of the month. See why "prioritizing" won't work? (3) To fund gov at the lowest cost &amp;pay obligations on time. Treasury uses short-term financing and small cash management bills. (4) The idea that Treasury *could* prioritize -- even if desired -- is fanciful &amp; misunderstands federal financing requirements. (5) We can't think of Treasury meeting obligations on a *monthly* basis; we have to think of cash management needs on a *daily* basis. (6) Because the revenue needs and obligations of an enormous government don't match up nicely for us -- they're very "spikey" &amp; mismatched. (7) Some think Treasury can somehow navigate through this, but Treasury can't tell SS beneficiaries to wait until the 3rd week of the month. (8) Some want to believe Admin is bluffing or being political by saying "default".To me, actual default is not just possible but likely. (9) I don't know if I can make it any more clear: there is no rational alternative to raising the debt ceiling, &amp; preferably early. FREE AppDownload
