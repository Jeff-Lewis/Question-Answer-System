InstagramThe controversial multilevel marketing health company Herbalife reported its third-quarter earnings on Monday afternoon. Earnings per share came in at $1.45. Analysts polled by Factset expected earnings per share to come in at $1.51, up from $1.41 at the same time last year. So that's a miss, and now the stock is getting punished. It's now down 12% in after-hours trading. Perhaps the worst part of the earnings release was that the company's guidance also fell remarkably short of The Street's expectations. Analysts expected 2015 guidance to indicate 7% revenue growth, but the company announced that it expected -1% to -2% revenue growth. And here's the chart, via MarketWatch: MarketWatch On Friday the company agreed to pay a $15 million fine to settle a class-action suit brought by a former employee who said the company was a pyramid scheme. That accusation has plagued the company since December 2012, when hedge fund manager Bill Ackman gave a 300-slide presentation making the same claim. He then announced that he was shorting the stock to zero. The resolution of the class-action suit suggests that the government may be done looking into Herbalife — definitely not good news for Ackman's trade. It is, however, good news for Carl Icahn, the investor who very publicly lambasted Ackman for his position. They have since made "friends." Check out the full earnings release below: Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) today reported third quarter net sales of $1.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 4 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Adjusted1 net income for the quarter was $125.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to $152.1 million, or $1.41 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. On a reported basis, the company announced third quarter net income of $11.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $142.0 million, or $1.32 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. Third quarter 2014 reported net income was negatively impacted by $139.5 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.97 per diluted share after tax, related to the remeasurement of Venezuelan Bolivar denominated assets and liabilities at the SICAD I and SICAD II rates, and $17.5 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.13 per diluted share after tax related to a legal reserve. For the quarter that ended September 30, 2014, the company generated $101.9 million net operating cash flow, and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the period were $34.5 million. Michael Johnson, chairman and CEO stated, “In the quarter we saw volume increases in two-thirds of our 91 countries, especially Russia and China. Excluding the impact of currency translation in Venezuela, the company had solid increases in both volume and net sales. We continue to implement initiatives that we believe will further strengthen our foundation and drive long-term improvements in activity, productivity and retention of our Sales Leaders. We are proud of our members’ ability to grow the business in the short term while embracing changes that we believe will enhance the long-term opportunity.” _______________ 1 See Schedule A – “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more detail. Mr. Johnson continued, “The changes we are applying globally, such as first order limits, have been tested in key markets and proven to drive positive results in terms of long term sustainable growth. China, Russia and parts of Europe are all great examples of markets that are stronger now than they were before we implemented such changes. “While these initiatives may continue to moderate near-term volumes and sales growth, we know from our experience in those markets that have already adopted them, that they enhance the experience of our members and their customers, and position us for even greater future success. Our industry-leading Gold Standard consumer protections, changes designed to encourage our newest members to grow their businesses prudently, and a focus on growing a customer base of life-long customers all help our members become more productive and successful leaders. We know that these initiatives work, and coupled with the strength of our business model, the efficacy of our products and the power of our brand, will lead the company into its next phase of growth.” Third Quarter 2014 Key Metrics2,3 Regional Volume Point and Average Active Sales Leader Metrics Volume Points (Mil) Average Active Sales LeadersRegion 3Q'14 Yr/Yr % Chg 3Q'14 Yr/Yr % ChgNorth America 303.0(4%)77,218 4%Asia Pacific (ex.

As a result, the Company's full year effective tax rate is impacted by these items. When applying the full year effective tax rate to year-to-date income, the Company's year-to-date tax provision recorded with respect to these non-GAAP adjustments is different from the forecasted full-year tax provision impact of these items. As a consequence, adjustments to the year-to-date and quarterly tax impacts will be recorded as the adjusted full year effective tax rate is applied to income in subsequent periods. Additionally, adjustments to items unrelated to these non-GAAP adjustments may have an effect on the income tax impact of these non-GAAP adjustments in subsequent periods. The Company plans to update the income tax impact of these items in subsequent interim reporting periods.(2) Net of $55,801 and $(12) tax benefit for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively; and net of $76,118 and $6,796 tax benefit for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(3) Net of $1,461 and $773 tax benefit for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively; and net of $4,827 and $3,241 tax benefit for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(4) Net of $1,533 and $2,329 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, respectively.(5) Net of $1,817 and $4,095 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014, respectively.(6) Net of $93 and $96 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014, respectively.(7) Relates to non-cash expense on our convertible notes and prepaid forward share repurchase contract.(8) Net of $6,221 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014.(9) Net of $913 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014.(10) Amounts may not total due to rounding.The following is a reconciliation of total long-term debt to net debt: 9/30/14 12/31/13 Total long-term debt (current and long-term portion) $ 1,827,919 $ 931,269Less: Cash and cash equivalents 678,134 972,974Net debt $ 1,149,785 $ (41,705 ) Contact:Herbalife Ltd.Media Contact:Julian CacchioliVP, Worldwide Corp.
