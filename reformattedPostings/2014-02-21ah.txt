The Federal Reserve has published the transcripts from its 2008 Federal Open Market Committee meetings, and now we get to see what our new Fed chair was thinking during the recession.

For example, East Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures. [Laughter] Reservations are no longer necessary at many high-end restaurants. And the Silicon Valley Country Club, with a $250,000 entrance fee and seven-to-eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new members shrink to a mere thirteen. [Laughter] In other meetings, Yellen would warn that the country was near, or beyond, the brink of recession. FREE AppDownload
