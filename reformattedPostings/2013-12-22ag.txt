REUTERS/Mark BlinchThis Santa Claus deflated due to a power outage. Some economists warn that inflation may be coming back.Last week, the Federal Reserve unexpectedly announced that it was tapering its stimulative quantitative easing program, the first step in the long process of unwinding years of easy monetary policy. Stocks rocketed to all-time highs. Among other things, the Fed lowered its forecasts for unemployment and raised its forecasts for GDP growth. It also reduced its expectations for inflation. However, there are signs that a higher rate of inflation may be on the horizon. Here are three related bullets from UBS's Friday note to clients: "Around half of core PCE slowdown has reflected what may be just temporary medical cost slowing"; "Shortages of specific labor skills (eg, in manufacturing and construction) spell selective wage hikes"; and "Tighter rental market implying further rent acceleration." Inflation is something we'll have to keep a close eye on.

His number: 1,850. "We think the S&amp;P likely stays within +/- 5% range from 1800 for the next several months as investors watch EPS and interest rate trends," wrote Bianco in his 2014 outlook. "We expect 2014 to be a year of normal EPS growth, normal PEs, normal total returns, but also normal volatility. Normal volatility includes at least one S&amp;P 500 price dip of 5% -9.9%. Since 1960, the only years when the S&amp;P didn’t suffer a 5%+ dip were 1964, 1993 &amp; 1995." FREE AppDownload
