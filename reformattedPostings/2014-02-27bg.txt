       The labor market improved further during the second half of 2013 and into early 2014 as the economic recovery strengthened: Employment has increased at an average monthly pace of about 175,000 since June, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.5&#160;percent in June to 6.6&#160;percent in January. With these gains, payrolls have risen a cumulative 3-1/4 million and the unemployment rate has declined 1-1/2&#160;percentage points since August 2012, the month before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, even with these improvements, the unemployment rate remains well above levels that FOMC participants judge to be sustainable in the longer run.               Consumer price inflation remained low. The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of only 1&#160;percent in the second half of last year, noticeably below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2&#160;percent. However, some of the recent softness reflects factors that seem likely to prove transitory, and survey- and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained in the ranges seen over the past several years.
