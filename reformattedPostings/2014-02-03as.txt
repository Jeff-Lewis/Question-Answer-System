Herbalife had a big bounce at the end of the day with the stock surging in the final hour of trading to close up more than 7%.  Early this morning, the stock was up after Herbalife released two press releases relating to earnings and announcing a $1 billion convertible bond note offering.  Then, shares of Herbalife fell about 3% after Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square launched a new website this morning taking on the company's distributors that they believe use predatory business practices.  You can see in the chart below the stock rally and volume spike in the final hour of trading.  Yahoo!
