Last night was the "Super Moon", which is the largest full moon of the year. As Dina Spector explained: A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the moon being closest to Earth in its orbit, also known as perigee. The near perfect timing of these two celestial events makes the moon appear larger and brighter in the night sky.  Lots of photographers (pro and amateur alike) snapped gorgeous pictures of the Super Moon. The most incredible one comes from Carlos Allegri at Reuters, who, perfectly enough, captured riders on the "Luna Park" Swing Ride at Coney Island, in Brooklyn.
