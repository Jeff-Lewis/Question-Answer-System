Kwasi Enin, the high school student who got into all eight Ivy League schools, is choosing Yale, according to USA Today.  Enin announced the news today at a press conference in his high school's gym. The 17-year-old always had Yale in mind because of its strong music program, and he said that after visiting the university last week he said he was "blown away by the music scene." Enin is also interested in studying science, he said in a press conference today. "I met people who were just like me — diverse in both science and music – and they told me how manageable it is doing both," he said, according to USA Today. Enin scored a 2250 on his SAT, had taken 11 AP classes, and blew admissions directors away with his sincere essay.
