REUTERS/Petar KujundzicChina's President Xi JinpingXi's efforts to rein in corruption have surprised many and there is much speculation about what is really going in with the crackdown. Among the key questions: 1. Is it a political purge, is it a broader, unprecedented in recent years effort to seriously tackle corruption, or is a combination of both? 2. Is the crackdown also a tool to weaken vested interests and set the stage for the comprehensive reforms mooted at the Third Plenum? 3. Is it a campaign that will soon run its course, or are Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan trying to build an institutional framework that will allow for ongoing, more consistent efforts to fight corruption? 4. What is clean enough, as no one can really believe corruption can be eradicated? 5. Can Beijing really be serious about fighting corruption without broader reforms that allow more independent oversight?   I wish I knew the answers, and certainly lots of us have opinions and hypotheses. I am sticking with what I wrote in the January 2013 Chinafile conversation Is Xi Jinping’s Fight Against Corruption For Real?:  ...Few outside observers believe corruption can be rooted out without broader political changes, but Mr. Xi appears determined to push this current crackdown farther than most believed... I know, it may be too late, and many are convinced this is just a lot of thunder without the rain. But do not underestimate how serious he is, and how much personal prestige he is investing. The recent Politburo meeting deserves more attention than it has gotten outside of official media. The comment that this latest meeting signals an upgrading of the “eight rules” is interesting. The corruption crackdown and austerity may in fact deepen." Eighteen months on, the odds of the crackdown continuing to deepen look high.
