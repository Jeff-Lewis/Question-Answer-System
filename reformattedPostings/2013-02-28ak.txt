Here's some bad news for some McDonald's fans. The fast food titan is cutting Chicken Selects and the apple walnut salad from its menu. The Angus Third Pounder may also be killed off, according to a report from the Chicago Tribune. A company spokesperson said that McDonald's is "reviewing options" at the moment. McDonald's is doing it to make room for new products that are in the pipeline, like the McWrap — a larger version of its snack wraps. The news first became public when a McDonald's franchisee posted about it on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook page has since been taken down, but not before the Kentucky New Era caught a peek.
