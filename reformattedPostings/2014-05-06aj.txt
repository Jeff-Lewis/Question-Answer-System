The retailer reported Q2 earnings of $0.38 per share, missing estimates for $0.41 per share. Comp sales were up 4.5% in the second quarter, missing expectations for a 5.4% rise.

The retailer has come under increased pressure in the increasingly competitive natural foods sector. "As we continue to innovate and evolve at a fast pace, we are confident in our ability to gain market share and expect our sales to approach $25 billion over the next five years," said John Mackey co-CEO of Whole Foods Market in a press release.
