Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesIt's going to be a surprisingly stacked day for economic data. We already wrote earlier about CPI, which is coming out at 8:30. It's particularly interesting, because with the economy gathering steam, watching inflation measures will be more important. There are three other reports as well. From Calculated Risk: • Also at 8:30 AM, the NY Fed Empire Manufacturing Survey for March. The consensus is for a reading of 8.5, down from 10.0 in February (above zero is expansion). • At 9:15 AM, the Fed will release Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for February. The consensus is for a 0.3 percent increase in Industrial Production in February, and for Capacity Utilization to increase to 79.3 percent. • At 9:55 AM, the preliminary March Reuter's/University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment indexwill be released. The consensus is for a reading of 77.5, down from 77.6. Each of these is pretty significant to watch. FREE AppDownload
