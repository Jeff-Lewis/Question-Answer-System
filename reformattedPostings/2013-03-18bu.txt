APVia Bloomberg, AP is reporting that Cypriot banks will now remain closed through Thursday. The bank bailout deal was completed over the weekend to take advantage of a bank holiday in the EU today, owing to the St. Patrick's Day holiday. However, the holiday was extended through Tuesday to allow the Cypriot government more time to pass a vote on the bailout deal, which includes a controversial haircut on depositors. Now, depositors in Cyprus won't be able to access their funds until Friday at the earliest. FREE AppDownload
