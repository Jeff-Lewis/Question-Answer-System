REUTERS/Eric ThayerHousing starts plummeted 16% month-over-month to an annualized pace of 880,000. This was worse than expectations for  a 4.9% to an annualized pace of 950,000 units. December's data was revised up to reflect a 4.8% fall to 1.04 million units. This compares with an initial print of a 9.8% fall to 999,000. Meanwhile, building permits fell 5.4% to 937,000, missing expectations for a 1.6% fall to 975,000. December's number was revised up to reflect a 2.6% fall to 991,000, compared with an initial print of a 3% fall to 986,000. The Northeast however saw housing starts rise a whopping 61.9% to an annualized pace of 136,000 units. Meanwhile, in the Midwest they fell 68% to 50,000 units SAAR, the lowest on record. "Horrible numbers but they have to be seen in the context of the severe weather," Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients. "That said, December was snowier than usual but starts were strong, so the weather perhaps is note the only source of Jan weakness." "Permits are much less sensitive to the weather than starts, so we are disappointed by the Jan drop. Between their peak in Oct and Jan, multi-family permits have dropped by 83K; single-family have slipped only 39K from their Nov peak, suggesting that perhaps the multi-family market is losing real steam. That said, we are reluctant to draw any firm conclusions  until we see what happens to activity when the snow stops." On Tuesday, we saw homebuilder confidence tumble t0 46 in February. "Unusually severe weather conditions," and "continued concerns over the cost and availability of labor and lots" were blamed for the slump in homebuilder confidence. Housing data has been deteriorating for some time now and we've also seen mortgage applications fall on the back of rising mortgage rates.
