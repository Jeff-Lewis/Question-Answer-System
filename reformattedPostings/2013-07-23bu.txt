From the report: Retail sales contracted this month, leaving the index at -22, twenty-three points below last month's reading. Sales of big-ticket items declined slightly, while shopper traffic dwindled. The index for big-ticket sales slipped to -5, a point lower than the June reading, while the index for shopper traffic tumbled twenty-two points to -16. Inventories declined more slowly than last month, with that index settling at -12 compared to -22. Retailers were doubtful about sales in the next six months; the expectations index dropped to -29 from June's reading of 11. Retailers reduced their number of employees this month. The index fell twelve points lower to end at -14. Average retail wages were little changed, however. That index ended the survey period at 1, compared to the June reading of 4.
