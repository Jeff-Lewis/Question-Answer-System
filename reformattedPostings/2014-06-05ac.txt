ZillowThe median price for an existing home in the United States is $211,000, according to the National Association of Realtors. However, these twelve homes blow this average away with price tags in the high millions.  With the help of Zillow, we've put together a list of the most expensive homes currently on the market in the U.S. They range from penthouse apartments to sprawling estates, and each has amenities that most people can only dream about. All of the homes are located in either New York or California, which is unsurprising as both are in the top 10 most expensive states in America. Paige Cooperstein contributed to this story.
