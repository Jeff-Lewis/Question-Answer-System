James Lee/flickrWASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment rates rose in nearly half of U.S. states in August, even as employers in two-thirds of the states added jobs. The Labor Department says unemployment increased in 24 states, fell in 15 and was unchanged in 11. Hiring picked up in 35 states, while it fell in 15. Unemployment rates can rise even when hiring increases if more people start looking for work and don't immediately find jobs. The figures suggest hiring was broad-based across most regions of the country last month, even as nationwide job gains in August were the weakest this year. Georgia reported the nation's highest unemployment rate, at 8.1 percent, followed by Mississippi at 7.9 percent. That's the first time Georgia has had the highest rate since the Great Recession ended. Copyright (2014) Associated Press. All rights reserved.
