However, all of that quickly turned as he continued to recommend clients buy telecom stocks as prices tumbled. Investigations ensued, conflicts of interest were suspected, and eventually Grubman was banned from the industry by the SEC. Here's a description in a piece he wrote for the New York Times this week: He was a top-ranked telecommunications research analyst on Wall Street in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, he settled a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over accusations that his work for investment banking clients led him to publish misleading research reports on companies that his employer, Citigroup, advised. As part of the settlement, in which Mr. Grubman did not admit or deny the allegations, he was barred from the securities industry.  One email about then-Citi CEO Sandy Weill and Grubman's kids got out that really raised eyebrows.  From the New York Observer: The smoking gun was a 2001 email to a friend: “You know everyone thinks I upgraded [AT&amp;T] to get lead for [AT&amp;T Wireless]. Nope. I used Sandy to get my kids in 92nd ST Y pre-school (which is harder than Harvard) and Sandy needed Armstrong’s vote on our board to nuke Reed in showdown. Once coast was clear for both of us (ie Sandy clear victor and my kids confirmed) I went back to my normal negative self on [AT&amp;T]. Armstrong never knew that we both (Sandy and I) played him like a fiddle.” This morning, Grubman appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box to talk telecoms.  Here's one memorable quote that came out of the appearance: Grubman on @squawkcnbc: "I would argue nothing has changed on Wall Street since I left."
