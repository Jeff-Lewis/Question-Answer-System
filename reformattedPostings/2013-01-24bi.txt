www.cbsnews.comIn 2008, "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett and some hedge fund guys made a wager that's been dubbed the "Million-Dollar Bet."  In sum, Buffett's wager against the hedge funders is that over a period of ten years hedge fund fund-of-funds could not beat the S&amp;P index.  For the bet, five fund-of-funds (which haven't been named publicly) picked by Protégé are competing against Vanguard's Admiral shares, the S&amp;P index fund Buffett is backing. It's been five years since that bet was made and we're currently at the half-way mark.  According to Fortune's Carol Loomis Buffett is winning.  From Fortune:  So now the tortoise, after crawling four more years, indeed leads. At the five-year mark, the Vanguard index fund backed by Buffett is up by 8.69%. The five funds of funds picked by Protégé Partners to carry its flag in the race are up, on the average, only—"gulp," says Protégé partner Ted Seides—0.13%. Of course, we still have five more years to see how this all plays out. What's more is whoever wins the bet will have a $1 million, or possibly more, donated to the charity of their choice.   FREE AppDownload
