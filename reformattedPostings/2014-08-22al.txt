APA Rolls Royce Trent powered Boeing 787-9 at the Farnborough Air ShowSEATTLE (Reuters) - The FAA has certified Boeing Co's 787-9 Dreamliner for use with General Electric Co engines, clearing the way for first deliveries of the new aircraft with the U.S.-made engines expected later this month. The 787-9 is a larger version of the original Dreamliner and had already obtained FAA certification with Rolls-Royce engines. The first delivery of that configuration occurred in June. An FAA certification document dated Thursday showed both the Rolls and GE engines as approved on the 787-9. The FAA and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The document was first reported by the blog All Things 787.   (Reporting By Alwyn Scott; Editing by Nick Zieminski) FREE AppDownload
