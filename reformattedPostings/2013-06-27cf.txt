WikipediaMarkets aren't doing much early in the European trading session. England's FTSE 100 is up 0.3%. France's CAC 40 is down 0.2%. Germany's DAX is flat. Spain's IBEX 35 is down 0.5%. Italy's FTSE MIB is flat. Asian market's followed the U.S. sharply higher in overnight trading. Japan's Nikkei jumped 2.9%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX climbed 1.6%.

The valid worry is that market tranquility may just invite selling by those that were sidelined in prior trading sessions by both price action and liquidity shortfalls." FREE AppDownload
