There is just one month left in 2014, and year-to-date, oil is the worst performing asset class. Via Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank, when priced in local currency — for which Reid uses US dollars — WTI and Brent crude oil are the worst performers year-to-date, with WTI down 32% and Brent down 36%. Silver has also had just a disaster of a year, falling 20% year-to-date in dollar terms The world's best performing asset class in 2014? The Shanghai Composite index, which is up 31% in renminbi terms. (Not pictured in Deutsche's chart, however, is India's Nifty stock index, which is up 38% this year when priced in rupees.)  In local currencies, some of the other outperformers this year are Spanish bonds, the S&amp;P 500, and Italian bonds. Priced in dollars, the Shanghai Composite is still the world's best performer, but is followed by the S&amp;P 500 and US corporate bonds. The dollar-based losers? Stocks in Russia, Greece, and Portugal. Here are the tables. Deutsche Bank FREE AppDownload
