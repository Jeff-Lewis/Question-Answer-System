Yesterday, Taleb sent out a tweet that caused a few other tweeters to poke fun, including Joe Cotterill, a reporter for the Financial Times; Lorcan Roche Kelly, Chief Europe Strategist at Trend Macrolytics; and Karl Whelan, an economist who worked for several years at the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of Ireland. To make a long story short, Taleb didn't find the jokes funny. The whole thing quickly devolved into a pretty heated exchange that ended up running all the way until this afternoon. We have chronicled the conversation here. FREE AppDownload
