@Alwaleed_Talal/TwitterPrince Alwaleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, the billionaire who broke ties with Forbes this month over the way the magazine valued him on its most recent rich list, has joined Twitter. It's a fitting move, considering that he made a $300 million investment in the social media company in late 2011, and now holds an estimated 3 percent stake in the company. The Prince has been tweeting from his official Twitter handle, @Alwaleed_Talal, in both English and Arabic for about a week. He already has close to 184,000 followers, and is Twitter-verified. We found out about the account from the Saudi-U.S. Trade Group. Thanks for the heads up! With my first tweet I look forward to connecting with you on this global platform. Alwaleed FREE AppDownload
