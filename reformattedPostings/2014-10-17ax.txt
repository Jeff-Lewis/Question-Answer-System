CIM Group and Macklowe PropertiesConstruction topped out at 432 Park Ave. last week, meaning the tower is officially the tallest residential building in New York City. The luxury condo stands at 1,396 feet, slightly taller than One World Trade Center, which is 1,362 feet tall (not including its spire, which brings its official height to 1,776 feet). It contains 104 condos, including 10 floors of penthouses. One already sold for $95 million. The views from the residences, some of the highest homes in the world, are truly astounding. Residents will be able to see to the top of Central Park to the north, One World Trade to the south, and Brooklyn and New Jersey to the east and west.  Developers CIM Group and Macklowe Properties shared these incredible photos, snapped from the top of 432 Park.
