Here is a quick time-lapse video of some of the major comparative patterns we introduced and utilized in the markets in 2012. We tend to gravitate towards comparatives of influential asset quality - because of the wider kinetic impacts they may exert and extrapolate on the overall market structure. We tend to approach charts more through the visual prism of impressions of price and momentum - than classic technical analysis per se. While we respect and benefit from those methodologies, we have personally found greater intuitive insights from removing some of the more rigid guidelines of that particular school of thought.   Thanks for following - and we look forward to another great year at Market Anthropology.  FREE AppDownload
