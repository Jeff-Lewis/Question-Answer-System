Patrick Semansky / APIt's Halftime, everyone.The first batch of earnings reports are in, and the picture is mixed. First, the main takeaways from the banks, JPM, WFC, and C: Yesterday, 2 major consumer staples companies reported – KO and JNJ.  Key points: Meanwhile, retailers have been struggling.  YUM and COST missed on both revenues and earnings (though COST reacted much better), while other retailers like GPS and LVMH have also missed expectations.  The widely cited Gallup poll shows a rapid loss of confidence among U.S. consumers due to the ongoing political impasse. Tech sector earnings are about to hit in earnest too.  Both INTC and YHOO beat this quarter’s expectations but lowered future estimates.  Tech bellwether reports continue today – EBAY and IBM report today after the close.  GOOG reports tomorrow afternoon.  We’ll have an IBM cheat sheet and a GOOG full preview later today.
