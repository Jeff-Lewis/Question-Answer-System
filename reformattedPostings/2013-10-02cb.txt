Our estimate for ADP’s employment number, which is a reasonable proxy for BLS payroll data in the last one year, is +170k, the same as our forecast for private payrolls.  Uncertainty of the government shutdown should provide a short term tailwind to a consolidation of the summer’s sell-off. We remain comfortable with our y/e forecast for 2.5% 10y, but a more acute scare in the budget and debt ceiling process could push yields even lower in the short run. FREE AppDownload
