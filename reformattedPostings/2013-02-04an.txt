Sotheby's International RealtyThere's really nothing like living on the ocean, perhaps that is why investment banker Rick Viton and his wife bought this Old Greenwich, CT home for $7 million and completely redesigned it inside and out (h/t WSJ). The five bedroom house sits on one acre and comes with a private deep water dock, 4 full bathrooms and two half baths, a pool and a spa. Paul Larson of Sotheby's International in Greenwich has the listing.
