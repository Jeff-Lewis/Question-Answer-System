The stock is down by over 10%. So what's happening? Brian Sozzi of Belus Capital Advisors says the story can be explained in two charts. "Outside of comps having peaked many quarters ago, Lululemon has not found a way to more efficiently and consistently develop its product to drive gross margin expansion relative to the comp slowdown," he said in an email blast to clients. Sozzi continued: When it DID try and develop its products a little cheaper, #SeeThroughGate reared its ugly head. That is why with increasing competitors attempting to replicate Lululemon's success in a low barrier to entry industry (a strong social media community does not qualify as having a wide moat...), which is eating into market share (see in the comp trend), made it especially critical for the company to bring in a new CEO, as it did, with a deep operations background.  The goal for him will not only be to reignite comps through new categories and global expansion, but to find ways to re-engineer the product to bring down costs and set gross margins back into expansionary territory (and then prepare them for another slowdown cycle well off into the future). By #SeeThroughGate, Sozzi is referring to customer complaining that Lululemon's yoga pants were see-through. Sozzi doesn't recommend investing in Lululemon. FREE AppDownload
