REUTERS/Rick WilkingWalmart executives say a "tough" and "unpredictable" economy and gridlock in Congress are hurting business.  "When all people hear about on the news is the stalled economy and the debt ceiling, that's not helpful," Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon said at Walmart's annual meeting with investors and analysts. "We're battling through that — and it is a constant battle." Walmart President and CEO Mike Duke tried to assure investors, however, that "no matter what environment we are in, Walmart will win." "Even in a tough and unpredictable economy, there is strength in our business all around the world," he said.  Same-store sales at Walmart U.S., its largest business, unexpectedly fell 0.3% in the second quarter. Simon said Walmart U.S. feels "pretty good" about profit but is "not satisfied at all" with sales. The underperformance was partially driven by a 7.5% decline in the bottom 10% of Walmart's large U.S. supercenters.  Lagging demand for electronics, such as big screen televisions, has been a particular drag on sales, Simon said. Meat, produce, home and apparel continue to be Walmart's best-performing categories.  To capitalize on the growing demand for low-cost groceries, the retail giant is expanding its Neighborhood Market stores, which are about a quarter of the size of Walmart supercenters and primarily offer meat and produce. The company plans to add more than 400 Neighborhood Market locations in the next three years, executives said.  FREE AppDownload
