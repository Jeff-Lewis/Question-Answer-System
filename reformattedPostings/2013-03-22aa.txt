Russian Emergency Ministry Here's the meteor trail of a fireball that exploded over Russia in February.Shortly before 8 p.m. EST Twitter began lighting up with reports of a bright streak in the sky, which many believe was a meteor.  Bloomberg News tweeted: "Reports of a possible seen on U.S. Eastern Seaboard; sightings from upstate New York to northern Virginia." Eyewitnesses say the meteor was bright green or blue in color, according to NBC Washington.   We haven't seen any visual confirmation of the meteor yet, but anyone who has photo or video of the observed bright streak can email dspector@businessinsider.com and we'll share it here.  This picture of meteor seen over Maryland seems to be circling Twitter, but a reader tipped us off that it was indeed a fake that pops up as "Belize Meteor" on Google images.  The reports come a little more than one month after a meteor exploded over Chelyabinsk Russia, creating a shockwave that blew out windows and injured nearly 1,500 people, mostly from flying shards of glass.  FREE AppDownload
