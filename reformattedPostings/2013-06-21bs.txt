Yesterday, Tesla unveiled a new 90-second "Battery Swap" service. To allay fears about long charge times for batteries, the company says that Model S drivers will be able to go to any service station this year, and swap their depleted battery for a fresh battery for a price of $60-$80, and that the whole process takes just 90 seconds. That's cool, but what's really cool is watching the presentation, and seeing how masterful a presenter Elon Musk is. In the clip below, Elon and Tesla have a car drive into the stage, getting its battery swapped ultra-fast, while a video of an Audi driver filling up his gas tank plays in the background. Not only is the swap they've set up faster, Tesla actually has a second driver come and get a battery swap on stage, which makes for some great showmanship. Not since Steve Jobs has any CEO combined innovation and showmanship like this.  FREE AppDownload
