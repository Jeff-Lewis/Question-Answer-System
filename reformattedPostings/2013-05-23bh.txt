REUTERS/Steve MarcusNew home sales climbed 2.3% month-over-month (MoM) to 454,000.  This beat expectations for a 1.9% rise to 425,000. March figures were revised up to show a 3.5% rise to 444,000, from 1.5% to 417,000. The median sales price was $271,600, and the average sales price was $330,800. Supply of homes continued to stay tight with new homes for sale at the end of April totaling 156,000 or 4.1 months supply at the current sales pace. Economists watch the new home sales number to get an insight into housing supply, because tight supply helps support home prices. It also reflects the health of the American consumer. Yesterday, we saw existing home sales rise 0.6%, missing expectations. But the silver lining in the report was that distressed sales accounted for a smaller portion of overall sales.
