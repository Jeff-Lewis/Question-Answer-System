In 2008, it was revealed that Kerviel lost the French bank approximately 4.9 billion euros ($6.9 billion) through unauthorized arbitrage of equity derivatives.  He was sentenced in October 2010 to three years in prison and slapped with a fine of 4.9 billion euros, but had appealed for a new trial. The appeals court in Paris court rejected his appeal earlier this year around the time he was finishing a backpacking pilgrimage to visit the pope.
