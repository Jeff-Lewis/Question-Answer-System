CorcoranBillionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, whose S.A.C. Capital has come under scrutiny lately, is having a hard time unloading some expensive art and real estate. He failed to sell some high-priced art at a November auction after his firm swallowed a record $1.2 billion fine. And he recently knocked the price on his gorgeous Upper East Side duplex penthouse from $115 million to $98 million, according to The New York Daily News. He bought the place for $24 million back in 2005, and hired late architect Charles Gwathmey to transform the space. It really is breathtaking. If you're wondering, the odd sculpture in the corner is a depiction of Pablo Picasso by Maurizio Cattelan. Corcoran has the details of the 9,000 square foot, 6 bedroom, 6.5 bathroom apartment at One Beacon Court. Anyway, let's take a tour of Cohen's apartment.  FREE AppDownload
