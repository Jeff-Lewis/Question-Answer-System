A final decision on the timing of an initial public offering (IPO) has yet to be taken and the company may opt to wait until next year, Sky News said, adding that Virgin Group, which owns more than 46.5 percent of Virgin Money, may retain its ownership after an IPO. Virgin Group could not be reached for comment outside of normal business hours.  (Reporting by Ankush Sharma in Bangalore; Editing by David Goodman) FREE AppDownload
