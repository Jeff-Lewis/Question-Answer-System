But the changing global landscape makes it more complicated for both affluent and mass affluent investors.  US Trust put out a report titled 101 Things Every Investor Should Know About The Global Economy earlier this year. Inspired by the report, we drew on some key global themes in terms of investment, trade, output, competitiveness and asset performance to pull together 27 key themes for investors. We look at the importance of foreign direct investment, growing sovereign wealth funds, disruptive technologies, and total returns that investors should keep an eye on. These themes can help guide investors in seeking out opportunities, both geographically and in terms of asset class. Note: The charts are not taken from US Trust. FREE AppDownload
