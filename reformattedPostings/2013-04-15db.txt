REUTERS/Jorge Dan LopezThe big story today is a continuation of Friday's big story: A decline in things Asia-related, commodities-related, and precious metals related. Gold and silver are both getting crushed again. Silver futures are down 8%, and have fallen below $24/oz. Gold is holding just barely above $1400.oz. Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets both fell over 1%, after a slew of Chinese data (including GDP) came in weak. That slammed the Aussie dollar, which is sensitive to Chinese data. That also caused more weakness in the big industrial commodities, like copper and oil, the latter of which is now below $90/barrel. Europe is lower, as are US futures. FREE AppDownload
