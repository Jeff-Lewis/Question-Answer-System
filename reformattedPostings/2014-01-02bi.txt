Dutch newspaper Volkskrant has collaged French President François Hollande's year of awkwardly botched handshakes with other world leaders.

Although, as "Le Huffington Post" notes, some of the photos were snapped seconds before an actual handshake takes place, so perhaps Hollande just tends to make the overture first.
