VFBill AckmanWe've read a copy of tomorrow's Vanity Fair profile on billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management — and you're definitely going to want to check it out. William Cohan's profile is packed with juicy tidbits about the relationships between the players in the latest hedge fund war over Herbalife.  Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutritional supplements, is at the center of a clash of hedge fund titans. On the bearish side, Ackman's Pershing Square is short-selling $1 billion worth of its shares with a price target of $0 because he believes it's a pyramid scheme. Meanwhile a number of hedge funders, including Ackman's former friend Daniel Loeb of Third Point LLC and long-time rival Carl Icahn, have snapped up big long stakes. Now some quotes from tomorrow's big article:  ON WHY ACKMAN'S NO LONGER FRIENDS WITH GREENLIGHT'S DAVID EINHORN: HEDGE FUNDER BOB CHAPMAN, WHO WENT LONG HERBALIFE AND IS KNOWN FOR HIS VITRIOLIC LETTERS TO COMPANIES, ON WHY OTHER HEDGE FUNDERS DISLIKE ACKMAN: ACKMAN ON CHAPMAN: AN UNNAMED HEDGE FUNDER ALSO POINTS OUT HOW ACKMAN CAN OFFEND OTHERS: ACKMAN CASUALLY REVEALS HE HAD SKIN CANCER: You definitely want to check out the full profile when it comes out.
