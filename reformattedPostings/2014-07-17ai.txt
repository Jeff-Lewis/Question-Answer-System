AP Photo/Manu FernandezIBM CEO Ginni RomettyIBM just reported its quarterly earnings and it's full of good news. It reported darnings per share of $4.32 and revenue of $24.36 billion. That's a beat, all the way around. Wall Street analysts expected $4.29 cents EPS on $24.12 billion in revenue. The expectations for revenue were modest, a 3% decline. IBM still reported a decline, but of only 2%. The expectations for profits were significantly higher as IBM marches toward its promised $20 EPS by 2015. IBM reported $3.22 EPS in the year-ago quarter. The company also reiterated its EPS guidance for the full-year of at least $18. This is an important beat for IBM. Revenues at IBM have been shrinking for a while and it's been struggling to hit Wall Street's revenue expectations for more than a year now. During fiscal 2013 it missed expectations four times in a row. It also missed on revenue for its first quarter 2014. In May, CEO Ginni Rometty said that growing revenue was "not the No. 1 priority on my list." Instead, she's trimming the company's least profitable business units (commodity hardware) and shifting resources to new, growing and more profitable areas (namely cloud computing). She's laying off thousands of workers in the process and hiring thousands of others with new skill sets. “We don’t want empty calories,” Rometty told the New York Times. “So when people keep pushing us for growth, that is not the number one priority on my list.” Here's the relevant parts of the press release: ARMONK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IBM (NYSE:IBM) Diluted EPS:GAAP: $4.12, up 42 percent;Operating (non-GAAP): $4.32, up 34 percent; Net income:GAAP: $4.1 billion, up 28 percent;Operating (non-GAAP): $4.3 billion, up 21 percent; Gross profit margin:GAAP: 49.1 percent, up 50 basis points;Operating (non-GAAP): 49.8 percent, up 10 basis points; Revenue: $24.4 billion:Down 2 percent; down 1 percent adjusting for divested customer care outsourcing business;Software, Services adjusting for divested customer care outsourcing business and Global Financing grew; Systems and Technology declined; Services backlog of $136 billion, down 1 percent adjusting for divested customer care outsourcing business; Strategic growth initiatives grew double digits: Cloud revenue up more than 50 percent year-to-date;For cloud delivered as a service, second-quarter annual run rate up nearly 100 percent to $2.8 billion year-to-year; Business analytics revenue up 7 percent year-to-date; Mobile revenue up more than 100 percent year-to-date; Security revenue up more than 20 percent year-to-date;Continue to expect full-year operating (non-GAAP) EPS of at least $18.00.IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced second-quarter 2014 diluted earnings of $4.12 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $2.91 per share in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 42 percent.
