Business InsiderJeff GundlachJeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Funds just held a public webcast. The bond god unveiled his outlook for the markets and economy in 2014. "They say things are fast-moving in the year of the horse," he said, referencing the Chinese zodiac. As the Federal Reserve tapers its monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of bonds, Gundlach thinks there is likely to be much more volatility in 2014 than 2013. He doesn't see stocks delivering the 30% returns of 2013. In the near-term, he sees Treasury yields going lower with the 10-year yield possibly going as low as 2.5%. Gundlach sees opportunity in gold and gold mining stocks.  He thinks the yellow metal could see $1,350/oz this year.    "Do not sell your gold. If you want to speculate, I would be on the long side of the miners." "Bitcoin to me is a bit of a mirage." Maybe one day it'll take hold.      "The next employment report will be extremely important." If you thought weather hit the last report, it'll definitely hit the next one. Driver-less cars are also cool. FREE AppDownload
