Ol.V!er/flickrYesterday, Scott Adams, the creator of world-renowned comic-strip "Dilbert," published a blog post predicting a 20 percent drop-off in financial markets and said stock movements were little more than a conspiracy among Wall Street's elite. We were a bit surprised to see a cartoonist making a very specific call about a forthcoming "correction."

And they know it. Then they sell their advice to people who don't know it.

How do you think that plays out? We can only give a guess of the odds that the market is being manipulated.
