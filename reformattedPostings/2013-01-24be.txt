An extraordinary statistic tweeted by Idealab CEO Bill Gross from a Davos session he is attending: "The 6 members of the Walmart family have as much combined wealth as the entire bottom 1/3 of the United States." #WEF Too bad Walmart doesn't pay its poor and lower-middle-class workers enough to lift them out of near-poverty. (The average Walmart associate wage is about $12 an hour. That's about $25,000 a year--close to the poverty line.) (And, no, I'm not a "Marxist." But I do think that one of the ways to fix our crappy economy is to persuade companies to pay people more. Walmart's associates are dedicating their lives to the company. And Walmart a mind-bogglingly successful and excellent company, barely pays them enough to lift them out of poverty.) FREE AppDownload
