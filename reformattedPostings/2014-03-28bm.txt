Business Insider/Matthew Boesler (data from Bloomberg) The final results of the University of Michigan's monthly consumer confidence survey are out. The report's headline index fell to 80.0 from February's 81.6 reading, marking the lowest level since November. Economists expected the index to fall to 80.5. Preliminary survey results published by the university two weeks ago suggested the index would fall to 79.9. The economic conditions sub-index rose to 95.7 from February's 95.4 reading, while the economic outlook sub-index fell to 70.0 from 72.7. Inflation expectations one year ahead and five years ahead were unchanged at 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively. "37% of respondents reported that their financial situation was better compared with a year ago, which was the same percentage that reported it was worse; still, more than twice as many consumers (33%) expected an improving financial situation in the coming year than expected a worse one (16%)," says Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays. "Only 15% of respondents expected unemployment to decline in the coming year, the softest reading since 2011; that said, the unemployment rate has fallen 3.3 percentage points since its peak even though no more than 30% of consumers have expected declines at any point during that time."
