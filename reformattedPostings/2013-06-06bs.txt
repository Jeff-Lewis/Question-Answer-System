Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan remains defiant after returning from a four-day trip to Africa, fueling the public anger that has led to six days of intense protests. On Thursday he reiterated plans to remove trees in Gezi Park and build a mosque in Istanbul's Taksim Square, and even dismissed a question about his deputy prime minister's apology for police savagely beating protesters. Meanwhile demonstrators — backed by Turkey's robust labor unions — continue demanding that the government abandon plans to overhaul the heart of Istanbul, and that it sack authorities deemed responsible for violence during recent clashes. Turkey analyst and Turkish daily Vatan Washington correspondent Ilhan Tanir tweeted that Erdogan's comments "didn't didn't surprise anyone. There is no a step back, no softening the tone. Barely acknowledged the dpt PM Arinc's apology." Wow. RT @joewsj: Nosedive. RT @benjaminharvey: Stock market after Erdogan started speaking. Incredible- look at this: twitter.com/BenjaminHarvey… Erdogan's tone: "we already accepted excessive use of tear gas, get over it." #occupygezi Erdogan either just doesn't get it, or doesn't want to get it. What a disaster. #occupygezi Thousands of demonsrators have established makeshift camp in the Taksim Square, which is a popular gathering place and symbol for the country's labor movement. On Wednesday Daren Butler and Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters reported "is taking on the look of a more enduring settlement" with small tents, foods, face masks, and a nascent library. So as protestsers hunker down in the park while the prime minister doubles down on plans to uproot it, the unrest continues. The Economist's cover is very interesting: Democrat or sultan? w/a gas mask. v @ekizilkaya twitter.com/WashingtonPoin… FREE AppDownload
