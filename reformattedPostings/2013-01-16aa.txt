The government gives Internet companies such as Tencent general guidelines for censorship, leaving most companies to make their own decisions in many cases. That sometimes leaves individual companies to make the tough calculation between pleasing domestic censors and serving international users. Activists also say Chinese Internet services are broadly used by the Chinese government to track their movements. Last week, an anticensorship activist at the Southern Weekly protests who had been detained by authorities for a day told The Wall Street Journal that his only activity before he was picked up was communicating with his friends via WeChat. Tencent didn't respond to requests for comment on the issue.Struggle Is The Enemy, Weed Is The Remedy: The Truth About Marijuana in North Korea | NK News – North Korea News - sounds like a joint CIA/NIS operation to seed the DPRK with 30%+ THC strain seeds could be in order?// NK NEWS receives regular reports from visitors returning from North Korea, who tell us of marijuana plants growing freely along the roadsides, from northern port town Chongjin, right down to the streets of Pyongyang, where it is smoked freely and its sweet scent often catches your nostrils unannounced. There is no taboo around pot smoking in the country – many North Koreans know the drug exists and have smoked it. In North Korea, the drug goes by the name of ip tambae or “leaf tobacco.” It is reported to be especially popular amongst young soldiers in the North Korean military – rather than getting hooked on tar &amp; nicotine like their contemporaries in the West, they fraternize without fear of repercussion by lighting up king-sized doobies during down time on the military beat.United Family Home Health - interesting new service, probably a big market among rich Chinese in Beijing..house calls the ultimate luxury, especially in China// United Family Home Health is one of the first home care services in China with a medical focus, and its vision is to provide clients and their families with United Family Healthcare's world-class medical care from the comfort of their homes.BUSINESS AND ECONOMYChina Set to Exit Slowdown as Government Supports Infrastructure - Bloomberg - The National Bureau of Statistics will report tomorrow that gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. That’s up from a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period. The risk is that the rebound may fade in the second half as the boost from railways and road projects ebbs and the government grapples with rising inflation and the expansion of shadow banking. While the nation is set to reverse its slide in economic growth, the pace remains short of the 10 percent average of the past two decades as higher wages and weakness in global demand limit export gainsChina Loses Edge As World's Factory Floor - WSJ.com - Foreign capital helped build China into a low-cost manufacturing powerhouse and global growth engine. But its increasingly urban population now has higher expectations in terms of wages and working conditions and louder objections to the pollution that often comes with low-level manufacturing—demands that have eroded China's cost advantage.China Billionaire Minted as Venezuela Orders Oil Gear - Bloomberg - Sun Weijie, chairman of Yantai Jereh Oilfield Services Group Co. (002353), has become a billionaire as shares of the Chinese oil equipment and service provider he co-founded surged on a supply contract from Venezuela.Jereh has been picked by Venezuela’s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A to supply equipment and tubes valued at $178 million, the Yantai, China-based company said on Jan. 10. The deal is equal to 40 percent of Jereh’s sales in 2012.Cash wave washes China’s banks off course - FT.com -deep waters around the Tao case//  This couplet, from eighth century Tang dynasty poet Li Bai, was meant to describe the Postal Savings Bank’s transformation from a stodgy savings network to a bank at the cutting edge of rural development. With hindsight, we now know that the poem in fact foretold a doomed voyage for Mr Tao. He could not ride the wind and was eventually swallowed up by the waves. Mr Tao was detained in June for an investigation into “personal economic issues”. State media reported last week that he has been formally charged with corruption. It is alleged that he made illegal loans with bank money for personal benefit. Mr Tao’s downfall is a timely reminder of what remains the biggest problem in the Chinese financial system: an excessive concentration of money in the hands of state-run banks.Deloitte Tightens Client Screening After China Scandals - WSJ.com-a joke..Deloitte didn't have standards before? and will this mean any deloitte-audited China firm should no longer be put on the "likely good short idea" list?//  Deloitte's Asia Pacific CEO, Chaly Mah, said the firm has specifically changed the work it does to test cash balances and introduced more stringent tests to determine whether to take on potential clients, for instance."We have a multilayer process but if you have clients that are less than honest it is not easy," he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.Report says sick chickens sold[1]|chinadaily.com.cn- A major chicken supplier in Central China has been suspected of selling sick birds to popular food chains including KFC, in the latest crisis to hit the country's poultry industry.According to a report on china.com.cn on Tuesday, several chicken farms owned by Doyoo Group in Henan province have been providing sick birds to the group, which resells the chickens to fast-food chains such as KFC and McDonald's.Agricultural products price continually rises in China - Xinhua | English.news.cn - the price of agricultural products in 36 large-and-medium-sized cities across the nation continued to rise from Jan. 7, 2013 to Jan. 13, 2013, a continuous rising in 11 consecutive weeks<U+4E00><U+7EBF><U+57CE><U+5E02><U+8C03><U+63A7><U+56F0><U+5883>:<U+56FD><U+4F01><U+7684><U+72C2><U+6B22><U+FF1F>|<U+623F><U+5730><U+4EA7>|<U+4E00><U+7EBF><U+57CE><U+5E02>|<U+8C03><U+63A7>_21<U+4E16><U+7EAA><U+7F51> - real estate controls have turned out to be benefecial to the big SOEs, at least in first tier one cities...caused some pain at start but now they are most of the last ones standing...//<U+6838><U+5FC3><U+63D0><U+793A>:2012<U+5E74>,<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+623F><U+4F01><U+5546><U+54C1><U+623F><U+9500><U+552E><U+91D1><U+989D><U+6392><U+884C><U+699C><U+4E2D>,<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+57CE><U+5EFA><U+3001><U+4E2D><U+6D77><U+3001><U+4FDD><U+5229><U+3001><U+9996><U+5F00><U+3001><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+94C1><U+5EFA><U+3001><U+4E2D><U+5316><U+65B9><U+5174><U+7B49><U+56FD><U+4F01><U+4EE5><U+8FC5><U+731B><U+7684><U+6001><U+52BF><U+62A2><U+5360><U+4E86><U+524D><U+5341><U+540D>,<U+6C11><U+4F01><U+53EA><U+6709><U+9F99><U+6E56><U+3001>SOHO<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5C1A><U+5B58><U+3002><U+8305><U+53F0><U+6574><U+6539>:<U+53CD><U+8150><U+6F6E><U+52A0><U+5FEB><U+767D><U+9152><U+4E1A><U+5168><U+9762><U+5E02><U+573A><U+5316> | <U+6BCF><U+7ECF><U+667A><U+5E93> - Moutai is in a big mess..not just corruption crackdown but big sales channel and administrative issues// <U+6838><U+5FC3><U+63D0><U+793A>: <U+867D><U+7136><U+8FD9><U+573A><U+8C8C><U+4F3C><U+51ED><U+501F><U+53CD><U+8150><U+7684><U+4E1C><U+98CE>,<U+56FD><U+5BB6><U+53C8><U+52A8><U+7528><U+4E86><U+884C><U+653F><U+624B><U+6BB5><U+6765><U+9650><U+5236><U+8305><U+53F0><U+7684><U+4EF7><U+683C>,<U+5176><U+5B9E><U+5374><U+662F><U+5728><U+52A8><U+7528><U+5E02><U+573A><U+7ECF><U+6D4E><U+7684><U+624B>,<U+52A0><U+901F><U+4EE5><U+8305><U+53F0><U+4E3A><U+9996><U+7684><U+9AD8><U+7AEF><U+767D><U+9152><U+4F01><U+4E1A><U+5B9E><U+73B0><U+5168><U+9762><U+5E02><U+573A><U+5316><U+7684><U+8FDB><U+7A0B><U+3002><U+8C01><U+5728><U+63A8><U+6DA8><U+94C1><U+77FF><U+77F3>_<U+6742><U+5FD7><U+9891><U+9053>_<U+8D22><U+65B0><U+7F51> - Caixin on who is pushing up price of iron ore// <U+4ECE>2012<U+5E74>9<U+6708><U+81F3><U+4ECA>,<U+8FDB><U+53E3><U+94C1><U+77FF><U+77F3><U+4EF7><U+683C><U+7531><U+4E0D><U+8DB3>90<U+7F8E><U+5143>/<U+5428><U+4E00><U+8DEF><U+72C2><U+6DA8><U+81F3><U+5F53><U+524D><U+7684>155<U+7F8E><U+5143>/<U+5428>,<U+6DA8><U+5E45><U+8FBE>75.1%<U+3002><U+7279><U+522B><U+662F><U+8FDB><U+5165>12<U+6708><U+4EE5><U+540E>,<U+77FF><U+4EF7><U+52A0><U+901F><U+4E0A><U+626C>,<U+77ED><U+77ED><U+4E00><U+4E2A><U+6708><U+65F6><U+95F4><U+7ADF><U+75AF><U+72C2><U+4E0A><U+6DA8><U+4E86><U+8FD1>40<U+7F8E><U+5143>,<U+6DA8><U+5E45><U+9AD8><U+8FBE>31.4%<U+3002>2013<U+5E74>1<U+6708>8<U+65E5>,<U+529B><U+62D3><U+7684>PB(<U+76AE><U+5C14><U+5DF4><U+62C9><U+6DF7><U+5408><U+77FF>)<U+7C89><U+77FF><U+62DB><U+6807><U+4EF7><U+683C><U+5DF2><U+63A5><U+8FD1><U+6BCF><U+5428>160<U+7F8E><U+5143><U+3002><U+5230><U+5E95><U+662F><U+4EC0><U+4E48><U+56E0><U+7D20><U+5728><U+63A8><U+52A8><U+94C1><U+77FF><U+77F3><U+4EF7><U+683C><U+7684><U+75AF><U+6DA8><U+FF1F>Corruption curbs crimp luxury market |Economy |chinadaily.com.cn- Ren said government officials, who used to be the main recipients of luxury watches as gifts, were unsure about the future policy environment.Several government officials who were noticed by the public to own luxury watches were investigated for corruption in 2012.
