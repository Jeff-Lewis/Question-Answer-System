BUSINESS INSIDER: To what extent do you think poor weather has impacted this winter’s economic data? DAVID ROSENBERG: I would say that the slowing is 50% weather and 50% fundamental with respect to inventory adjustment/savings rate and housing (tight mortgage lending). BI: What’s the big story that nobody is talking about right now? DR: That energy prices are on a discernible upward path. BI: Are you optimistic about Janet Yellen as Fed chair? DR: I’m optimistic that her policies will in the end generate far more inflation than is generally acknowledged. BI: The stock market is roaring back to all time highs. Do issues in EM not have as big an impact on U.S. markets as people argued a few weeks ago? DR: EM has a marginal impact at best… look at the 1997-98 Asian crisis: GDP growth averaged 4%, the unemployment rate went from 5% to 4.5% and the S&amp;P 500 ran up 20%… only became an issue towards the end of the crisis when it became a domestic financial event with the turmoil surrounding LTCM. BI: What’s something you’ll be watching this week and next? DR: The February employment report. Whether the S&amp;P 500 can break back above the mid-January highs on a closing basis. Beyond that, the March-April data will tell the tale as to just how much the latest poor data flow was a weather report. FREE AppDownload
