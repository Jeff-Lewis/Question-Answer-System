Wikimedia CommonsMcDonald's just reported first-quarter earnings of $1.21 per share, missing analysts' expectations for $1.24. This was on net revenue of $6.70 billion, a hair below the $6.72 billion expected. Comparable-store sales worldwide climbed 0.5% year over year. Here's a regional breakdown: The U.S. is obviously the laggard, missing analysts' expectation for a 1.4% drop. Management also warned that March comp sales fell 0.6% in the U.S., much worse than the 0.2% decline expected. "By leveraging a deeper understanding of what our customers want with the power of our business model, our investments in restaurant capabilities and modernization, and our hard-earned competitive advantages, we will grow McDonald's business and deliver enduring profitable growth over the long term," said CEO Don Thompson. "As we begin the second quarter, global comparable sales for the month of April are expected to be modestly positive." "Looking forward, McDonald's is focused on stabilizing key priority markets including the U.S., Germany, Australia and Japan," said management. Taco Bell recently entered the U.S. breakfast market, which may be putting pressure on McDonald's sales. FREE AppDownload
