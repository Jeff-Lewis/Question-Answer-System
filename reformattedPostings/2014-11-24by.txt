Futures snapshot at 6:47 a.m. EST (1147 GMT): * S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 3.75 points, or 0.18 percent, with 89,703 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.24 percent, in volume of 12,978 contracts. * Dow e-minis &lt;1YMc1&gt; were up 25 points, or 0.14 percent, with 11,782 contracts changing hands. ---* Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ending at closing records on the back of accommodative action from central banks in China and Europe. * Policy in China, the world's No. 2 economy, could spur more market gains. Sources told Reuters the country's leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions on concern falling prices could trigger a surge in debt defaults, business failures and job losses. * The S&amp;P 500 &lt;.SPX&gt; has appreciated 13.3 percent since an intraday low hit on Oct. 15, and the gains since then have been broad, with all but 23 S&amp;P 500 components higher.
