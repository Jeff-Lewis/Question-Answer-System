statigr.am In today's 24/7 news cycle,  business media has turned into a never-ending carousel of one so-called investment guru after the next.  In her book, "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry," Helaine Olen cites a Univ. of California study that found anytime a stock was mentioned by name on CNBC, its price immediately increased –– whether the news was positive or negative.  This is not a trend we should be thrilled about.  For starters, if a guy sitting in front of a half dozen cameras on national TV is touting stock advice, one thing is for sure: You're not the only one listening.
