PIMCOData from MorningstarPIMCO flagship Total Return Fund saw another month of net outflows. According to new data from Morningstar, the fund managed by Bill Gross saw net outflows of around $4.5 billion in June. That's the 14th straight month of net outflows for a cumulative total amount of $64 billion. PIMCO has attracted a lot of attention in recent months, largely due to the unexpected departure of CEO Mohamed El-Erian and revelations of Co-CIO Gross's unorthodox management style. Despite the outflows, PIMCO's fund continues to be massive with $225 billion in assets under management. It's worth nothing that outflows are not an industry-wide phenomenon. Competitor DoubleLine Funds, led by other bond king Jeff Gundlach, saw $515 million in net inflows in June into its flagship Total Return Fund. Total assets for that fund were $33 billion according to Morningstar. FREE AppDownload
