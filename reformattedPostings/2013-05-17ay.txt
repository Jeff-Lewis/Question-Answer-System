Everyone has to eat, even if they're working insane hours. Wall Streeter's (on top of having to eat) must also entertain clients. So they need to know something about decent food in NYC. Here at Business Insider, we like to keep tabs on where people are actually taking their expense accounts, or business associates, or girlfriends — whatever. So we asked our sources to give us a long list of restaurants that Wall Streeters go to, then we turned that list into a poll where readers rated each venue "Not Wall Street," "Sorta Wall Street," or "Totally Wall Street." Scientific, you see. Surprise, surprise, there are a ton of steakhouses on this list — but they aren't the only spots. Sushi and New American food make a showing, and most surprisingly, the winning restaurant isn't somewhere were you HAVE to make it rain to fill your stomach (you can if you want, though).
