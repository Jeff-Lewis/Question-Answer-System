"We will consider during the second half of this year whether to invest to add an additional production line (for the screens)," LG Display quoted Chief Executive Han Sang-beom as saying at a meeting with local reporters on Wednesday. A source told Reuters last month that the South Korean firm is the exclusive supplier of screens for the initial batch production of Apple Inc's first smartwatch.
