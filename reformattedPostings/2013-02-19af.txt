Niccolo Caranti In this coming weekend's Italian election, there's obviously a lot of attention paid to Silvio Berlusconi, and whether or not he'll make a strong, comeback showing. But the politician that a lot of folks are watching is Beppe Grillo, the head of his own "Five Start Movement" party, which has a very strong populist, anti-Eurozone, anti-banker bent. If he has a huge showing in the election -- and the last polls had him in 3rd place, even ahead of Mario Monti -- then that could cause a major political disturbing. Anyway, he had a huge rally in Milan tonight. Anywhere between 70k-100k showed up to hear him. Today, Milan: Beppe Grillo' rally.
