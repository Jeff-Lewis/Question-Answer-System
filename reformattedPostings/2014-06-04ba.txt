This was pretty much in line with expectations for a reading of 58.2, but down from a flash reading of 58.4. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Hiring in the services sector also climbed to 52.8, from 51.2 the previous month on the back of renewed confidence in the economic outlook. "The US economy is moving into the summer with renewed vigor," Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said in a press release. "Alongside the sister manufacturing survey, the upturn in the services PMI indicates that GDP looks set to rise at an annualized rate of 3% or more in the second quarter after the 1.0% weather-related decline in the first three months of the year."
