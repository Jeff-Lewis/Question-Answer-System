And those New Keynesian models ended up basically winning the battle of hearts and minds among a majority (though not an overwhelming majority) of macroeconomists, pushing out the RBC models that made the kind of equilibrium assumption that Lucas prefers.In other words, sometimes modeling the disequilibrium dynamics of one kind of "equilibrium" is really important. But to make that model, you assume an "equilibrium" of another kind. FREE AppDownload
