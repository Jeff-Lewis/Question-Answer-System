REUTERS/Anindito MukherjeeThe ISM non-manufacturing index increased to 55.2 in April from 53.1 in March. This was better than the 54.0 economists were forecasting. Any reading above 50 signals growth in the sector. "This is the strongest reading since last August and leaves the six-month moving average at 53.5," noted Barclays' Cooper Howes. "At its new level, the ISM non-manufacturing index is consistent with GDP growth of about 2.5% annualised, but we wouldn't be surprised to see it strengthen further over the next few months and we currently expect that second-quarter GDP growth will be as high as 3.5%," said Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth. The new orders subindex jumped to 58.2 from 53.4, and the export orders subindex ramped up to 57.0 from 49.5. This more than offset deterioration in the employment subindex, which fell to 51.3 from 53.6. "If sustained at this level, the index would be consistent with private payroll growth trending at only 130K or so," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson. "We hope this weakness is a hangover from the winter - before the weather hit, the index was consistently pointing to 200K-plus gains - but we can't yet be sure."
