Being a currency buff, I have always found Bitcoin and all of the other “alternative” currencies to be interesting, and a pleasant distraction.  A few months ago the price action seemed to suggest similar properties as many speculative bubbles do, so I penned a piece that compared Bitcoin to the South Seas Bubble.  I even went as far as to setup an account on CoinBase and accept Bitcoin deposits for The Idea Farm, but everyone seemed to prefer good old credit cards so I took it down. I thought it would be interesting to update the chart with the recent price action…are we about where Newton went broke? Meb Faber FREE AppDownload
