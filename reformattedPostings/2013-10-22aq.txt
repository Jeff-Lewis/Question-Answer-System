All energy production booms must fade. Eventually it becomes too expensive to drill — and there are, after all, a finite amount of resources in the ground. But as of October 2013, the Great American Shale Boom is showing few signs of losing steam. The EIA is out with a series documenting well production rates out of the boom's various epicenters: North Dakota's Bakken, Pennsylvania's Marcellus, Colorado's Niobrara and Texas' Permian, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford plays. (Here's the map showing where those all are:)EIAFirst, here are the EIA's conclusions: Let's see what this looks like in chart form. In both the Bakken and Eagle Ford, the amount of resources coming out of every new well drilled since about 2011 has gone up. One rig can drill multiple wells. Here's the chart for the Bakken... EIA And the Eagle Ford... EIA Older or "legacy" Bakken and Eagle Ford wells are seeing steeper production drop-offs, though this may be because oil companies don't yet feel the need to devote capital to squeezing more out of them. Bakken... EIA Eagle Ford... EIA Meanwhile, in the other regions, decline rates for oil or gas are easing up — which, again, means  EIAEIAEIA EIA It's possible that declining oil prices — crude dipped below $100 for the first time since July yesterday — could slow some of this activity. But the larger point is that there appear to be plenty of resources in the ground at a mostly reasonable price if we need them. FREE AppDownload
