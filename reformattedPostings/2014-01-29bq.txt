Shell said it has agreed to offload a 23-percent interest in the Parque das Conchas (BC-10) project offshore Brazil to new partner Qatar Petroleum International. The deal, which will leave Shell with a 50-percent stake, remains subject to regulatory approval in Brazil. The London-listed group will continue to operate the oil field, which currently produces 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shell added that it will retain a "significant" upstream presence in Brazil. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload
