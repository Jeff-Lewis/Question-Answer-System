Goldman Sachs / YouTubeGoldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius.The November jobs report is out, and the above-consensus numbers have some predicting that the Federal Reserve will announce the first tapering of its quantitative easing program at the December FOMC meeting in two weeks. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius is not one of them — he's sticking to his March taper call. "Despite the stronger-than-expected report, we do not think that today's release was strong enough to prompt the Fed to taper asset purchases in December as a baseline, although a move in December remains a possibility," says Hatzius. He does note, however, that the unemployment rate, at 7.0%, is now at a level which Fed chairman Ben Bernanke flagged earlier as where the Fed would likely finish tapering its bond buying, which will necessarily add further fuel to the argument that the FOMC should taper "sooner rather than later."
