ReutersThere's an excellent new paper on "The 1%" by Facundo Alvaredo, Anthony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez out today on NBER.  The paper is about what policies and trends have allowed the 1% to swell into such a powerful bloc. The paper is already the source of a number of great charts, but there's three in particular that really hammer home why there is such an obsession among the rich for lower taxes.  You're talking about a group that willingly spends millions every couple of years to try to get a preferred individual in a position of power to change taxes.  For starters here's a look at the top tax rates in the U.K., France, the U.S. and Germany.  The dark lines – an upside-down U-shape  — represent the U.S. and U.K. top rates. Notice how they started low early in the 20th century, rose upward to over 90% of income, then crashed back down.  The white lines — France and Germany — started out low, rose significantly, then remained relatively flat.

They're remembering the fifties, when they controlled the lowest percent of the income share and paid the highest taxes.  FREE AppDownload
