Reuters/Mario AnzuoniWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, during a conversation on leadership and the economy at The Women's Conference 2008 in Long Beach, California, on Oct. 22, 2008. Buffett said, "Hillary is going to run." Furthermore, he added that he's positive she will make it to the White House. "Hillary is going to win," Buffett said, adding, "I will bet money on it, I don't do that easily." Buffett was less willing to predict who might run against Clinton. "Her opponent will be whoever wins the Republican primary and there's going to be a lot of people who want to do it," said Buffett. Clinton, a former first lady, secretary of state, and 2008 presidential candidate, has said she will decide whether to run by the end of this year.  Watch a video of Buffett's comments below.  FREE AppDownload
