Shares of Chimerix dropped sharply, falling as much as 8% on Wednesday, after the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, a patient with Ebola who was being treated with the company's experimental treatment. A New York Times report from earlier Wednesday said Duncan was being treated with brincidofovir, Chimerix's experimental Ebola treatment, since Saturday. On Tuesday, shares of Chimerix rallied after officials at The Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit said another patient was being treated with brincidofovir.  Over the weekend, Chimerix announced that the FDA approved the potential use of brincidofovir in patients with Ebola.  Following Wednesday's news, shares of Tekmira, which is also developing a treatment for Ebola, were up 4%.  FREE AppDownload
