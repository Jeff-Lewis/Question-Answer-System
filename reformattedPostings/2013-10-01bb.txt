AP ImagesCameron and Tyler WinklevossSoftware eats everything, tech entrepreneur and VC Marc Andreessen likes to say. Once upon a time it was phone companies, newspaper publishers, and music industry execs who felt the sting. Now it’s anyone doing anything that can be done faster, cheaper, or better with a mainline into the Net’s billions of connected users around the world. And increasingly those are silicon-animated things as well as people. IGNITION: Future of Digital, BI's flagship event, takes Andreessen's pronouncement to heart. From November 11-13 at New York’s Time Warner Center, we’ll deliver three days of disruptions, only some of which revolve around screens. Nest’s Tony Faddell will show us how to turn homes into connected machines. Uber’s Travis Kalanick will talk about wiring on-demand transportation; the Winklevii on busting up money. And incomparable Elon Musk will be loosing fire hoses of bits across everything from interplanetary rockets and rooftop solar panels to the world’s coolest cars. We'll also tackle mobile commerce, branded content and native advertising, social television and news in the age of Twitter — IGNITION 2013 brings the whole disrupted online media scene under one roof. More than 85 speakers, doing up-close interviews, rousing roundtables, and live demos. Tesla cars! Amazing Central Park views! And — yes, we’re listening — more networking breaks. Join us next month to hear from:  For a taste of what you can expect in November, check out the latest IGNITION 2013 lineup, or the full agenda.   P.S.
