If you were off last week, you missed some big headlines. GDP growth was revised up to a whopping 5.0%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 hit all-time highs with the Dow crossing 18,000 for the first time ever. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Almost every major strategist on Wall Street is telling clients that stocks are going higher in 2015. However, almost all of those strategists are convinced gains will be very modest. But in the past week, we've heard from a trio of pros who warn bad things could be coming. "Since 1875, we have never seen the S&amp;P rise for seven calendar years in a row, so an eighth year would seem highly unlikely," Societe Generale's Roland Kaloyan said in a Dec. 17 note to clients. "We assume that the S&amp;P 500 will finish the year slightly down as the strengthening of the US dollar and the new tightening cycle offset the strong US GDP growth already priced-in at the start of the year." "I have the same kind of feel in ’98 and ’99; also ’05 and ’06," Uber bear David Tice told CNBC. "This is going to end badly. I have every confidence in the world." Tice said that stocks are doomed to plunge by 30%-60%. But, he doesn't have much skin in the game as he's not actually shorting the market. Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, however, has lots of skin in the game. "This year rhymes with 1998," Tepper said to CNBC. "Russia goes bad. Easing [is] coming from Europe. Sets up 1999 ... [oops] I mean 2015... You [just] have to be aware of the possibility for some sort of overvaluation of the markets. And they are fair value now."
