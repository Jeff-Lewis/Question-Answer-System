REUTERS/Toby MelvilleBarclays CEO Antony JenkinsShares of Barclays, one of Britain's biggest banks, are down more than 7% today after the bank announced in its quarterly earnings release a new plan to fill a £12.8 billion capital shortfall in order to meet updated regulatory requirements. The plan includes a £5.8 billion share offering, issuance of £2 billion in debt, and a £65-80 billion reduction of its loan book to approximately £1.5 trillion.
