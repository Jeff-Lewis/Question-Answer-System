With the labor market improving and after nearly six years of ultra-easy Federal Reserve policy, hawkish members of the FOMC have become increasingly vocal about the need to increase interest rates.  However, while these hawks generate a lot of headlines, they are a minority among voting members, occupying just two of 10 spots.  Next year, as the debate over rate hikes becomes more prominent, the annual rotation in voting FOMC members will further weaken the hawks and bolster the doves. This suggests that the risk lies with later rate increases, not earlier. Guggenheim Partners FREE AppDownload
