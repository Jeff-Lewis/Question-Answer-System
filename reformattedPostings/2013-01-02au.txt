If you're in the Financial District, you might want to check out this pizza making battle next month at Harry's Italian Pizza — we know Wall Street loves a challenge. The NY Post reports that Westchester pizza maker Bruno DiFabio, is going to try to break the 28 second world record for making a pie. He won an award for the best pizza at an international culinary competition in Paris in November, but the top spot for speed has consistently eluded him. Of course, the final product can't have any holes in it or anything like that. From the NY Post: He (DiFabio) hopes to beat his “arch rival and nemesis” Brian Edler, an owner of four Domino’s franchises in Ohio who set the current record in 2004 and made history in 2010 by churning out 206 pizzas in an hour — the only speed mark that Guinness recognizes. DiFabio’s edge is his “New York hand-slap,” a quick, back-and-forth flipping of dough, which gives him a read on its elasticity.
