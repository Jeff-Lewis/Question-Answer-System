Hackers affiliated with Anonymous seem to have published information from more than 4,000 American bank executive accounts on a government website last night, Violet Blue of ZDNet reports.

The hackers are calling for reform of U.S. computer crime law (specifically the 1984 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) after Swartz, 26, committed suicide on January 11 in the midst of an aggressive prosecution for allegedly downloading millions of academic articles from JSTOR. The hackers published a spreadsheet on the Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center website that appears to contain login information, credentials, IP addresses, and contact information of current American bank executives.
