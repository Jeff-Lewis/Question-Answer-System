In 1950 —45.8 percent of men 65 and older were working, according to a report on 65+ in the United States: 2010, released June 30 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Through the decades of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, generous pension plans made it ever likelier that men would hang up their work boots at earlier ages. By 1993, only 15.6 percent of men were working past age 65. (The number of women 65 and older who remained in the workforce has always been small, rising from 9.7 percent in 1950 to 10.6 percent in 2003.) Then came a perfect storm of factors in the last decade that has encouraged more older men -- and women -- to stay on the job, with workforce participation in 2010 rising to 22.1 percent among men older than 64 and 13.8 percent among women of the same age.  "The rise in labor force participation is interesting as both a potentially long-running trend, and because we saw that during the recession that it was the older workers whose employment share actually rose. They were the only age group to have their employment share rise," says Loraine West, chief of the Eurasia branch of the population division of the Census Bureau and an author of the report.Here are some of the issues — benign and otherwise — that the study suggests are pushing people to work longer. Social Security is the No. 1 source of income for everyone older than 64, with 86.3 percent receiving it. About 52 percent also have income from savings and nearly 40 percent get some pension or other kind of income from their former employers. More than 26 percent also rely on income from work. Expect that percentage to rise. "We haven't seen projections for the future, but researchers had already identified a rising trend in later retirements prior to the recession," West says.
