This weekend I’ll be visiting my dad at his house in Quogue and then hitting a big-time clambake at a beachfront manse in East Hampton. I’m excited for both, I must confess. Nicholas Colas, chief strategist at ConvergEx in New York, has an entertaining note out this morning using the Hamptons as a barometer for Wall Street confidence… The Hamptons are, in fact, the most perfect litmus test of New York/Wall Street financial confidence available.  This has been true since the Long Island Rail Road built the Montauk branch in the 1870s.  That development – along with electrification of the line in the 1920s – made the 90 mile trip possible for affluent-but-not-crazy-rich New York families, allowing them to enjoy the longest sand beach on the eastern seaboard just like the Vanderbilts and DuPonts. The Long Island Expressway didn’t make its way to Exit 70/71 until the 1960s; it was a very long drive indeed before that.  Add a few golf courses over the years (Maidstone, Shinnecock and National), one gorgeous lawn tennis club (Meadow), and a posh social registry (the Blue Book) and you have a summer recipe for wealthy New Yorkers that remains unchanged from the 1920s. On the surface, the upcoming July 4th weekend in the Hamptons has all the earmarks of a very confident New York/Wall Street community and we trot into the back half of 2014. Just a few data points here: So, you get the idea – the transient community has a few bucks to throw around.  Josh here – My advice to for the young money: Get your Gatsby on, kids. For next summer may not be as carefree and cheery as this one is.
