North Korean embassies in Cuba and Singapore were suspected by the eight member U.N. panel of experts of facilitating the country's banned arms trade, including a shipment of fighter jets and missile parts that were seized in Panama last July. The report also pointed to the use of more developed financial countermeasures used to mask the purchase of both banned and permitted goods. (Reporting by James Pearson.
