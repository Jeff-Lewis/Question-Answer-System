ChesapeakeThe EPA asked nine drillers to submit detailed information about their operations as part of the agency's years-long study of fracking's impact on drinking water. However, the companies deemed "a majority" of information they provided to the EPA's megastudy on fracking as confidential, which complicates the agency's ability to publish their findings. Just five companies submitted data that was not tagged proprietary or "confidential business information." The agency says it's trying to figure out how to resolve this dilemma: "As of September 2012, the EPA continues to clarify the information reported and to work with the nine hydraulic fracturing service companies to release information originally designated as CBI without compromising trade secrets."
