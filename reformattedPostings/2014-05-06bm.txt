This post is sponsored by OppenheimerFunds.   We're in the fourth year of an income famine. That's what economists call it when the Fed sets interest rates at low levels while investment-grade bonds are yielding less than inflation. That can lead to a budget crisis for anyone on a fixed income. Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds, says investors can either do nothing — and see their incomes shrink — or pull away from the Fed and decide on a differentiated fixed-income model that takes the right kind of risks. Investors should contact their advisers so they can start a new conversation about growth, income, and protection.* Watch the video above to find out more.  Learn more at GrowthIncomeProtection.com. * Protection is positioned as an investment goal. Investing in certain securities may help to hedge against certain risks, but does not imply any guarantee from loss. Mutual funds are subject to market risk and volatility. Shares may gain or lose value. Fixed income investing entails credit risks and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall.  Oppenheimer funds are distributed by OppenheimerFunds Distributor, Inc.
