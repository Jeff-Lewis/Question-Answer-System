Gregory Shamus/Getty ImagesThe final results from the University of Michigan's July consumer confidence survey are out. The headline index rose to 85.1 in July from June's 84.1 reading. Economists were expecting the index to fall to 84.0. Earlier this month, preliminary results published by the university showed the index falling to 83.9. The index of current conditions rose to 98.6 in July from 93.8 in June. The preliminary July reading was 99.7. The economic outlook sub-index fell to 76.5 in July from 77.8 in June. The preliminary July reading was 73.8. Inflation expectations one year ahead were 3.1% versus 3.0% in June and 3.3% earlier this month. Inflation expectations five years ahead were 2.8% versus 2.9% last month. "Rising confidence comes despite surging gas prices throughout the latter half of July," says Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. "In the first week of the month when the preliminary survey was prepared the price per gallon at the pump fell to $3.47 and has since reached $3.67. We believe that the diffusion of improved payroll data and growing chatter regarding soon-to-end Fed stimulus have boosted consumers’ perceptions of the overall health of the economy."
