Rightmove/The GuardianThe kitchen, living room, and bedroom are all seen in this photo.Think you can’t buy a flat in London for under £100,000? Think again. This pad in Streatham, south London, has just been reduced to $162,000 (£99,950) – or less than the cost of an underground parking space in Kensington. In recent months average prices in the capital have hit more than $810,177 (£500,000) and affordable properties have become thin on the ground. However, some experts have claimed the tide is turning, with Rightmove reporting falling asking prices in the capital and the CEBR suggesting, across the UK, that prices could drop by 0.8% in 2015. In the meantime, however, auction properties aside, this is currently the only home costing below the $161,000 (£100k) mark with a London postcode listed on the main property websites. Rightmove/The GuardianThe kitchen has a mini-fridge and a microwave and lots of cabinets. There is a drawback of course. It’s the very definition of “bijou” at just 206 square feet, including the bathroom and entrance hall and despite there being a kitchen area, as the pictures show, any cooking you want to do will end with a ping. Also both agents marketing the property suggest it needs updating, but would be great for buy-to-let, which suggests a would-be buyer might struggle to raise a mortgage on it. Still, someone might decide they are getting a bargain. Zoopla shows that it was originally put on the market in August for $210,704 (£129,950) but the price has been cut twice since. And when across London you can pay £1.25m for a studio flat that is only two-and-a-half times the size that may be something to consider.
