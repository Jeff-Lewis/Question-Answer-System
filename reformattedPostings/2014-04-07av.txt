Renaissance Macro Research, Bureau of Labor Statistics The U.S. labor force participation rate rose to 63.2% in March from 63.0% in February, according to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday in the monthly jobs report. As illustrated in the chart above, the 0.4 percentage-point gain over the past three months is something of a rare event — in the last 22 years, it's only happened 5 times. "We’re skeptical the upward trend in participation will continue," says Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. "Instead, we expect entrants into the labor force to roughly offset retirees. Over the last year, the labor force has expanded by 94,000 per month. The number of retired workers filing for Social Security? 94,512 per month over the last year." The rise in labor force participation brings into focus an interesting tension between two powerful forces: the retirement of the baby boom generation, which exerts massive downward pressure on the labor force participation rate, and improving economic fundamentals, which may be drawing discouraged workers back into the labor force. "This is a good sign suggesting that people believe they can find work or — with the cancellation of extended unemployment benefits — need to," say economists at UBS. "An even better sign is that the labor force is expanding without boosting unemployment." Which of these two forces will win out could be a big story for the labor market in 2014. FREE AppDownload
