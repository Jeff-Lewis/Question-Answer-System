Phil Denton / Creative CommonsThe New York Times' John Broder has responded to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's point-by-point response to his review of the company's Model S car, and basically says Tesla's own employees instructed him to do everything Musk took him to task for: Beginning early in the morning of my second day with the car, after the projected range had dropped precipitously while parked overnight, I spoke numerous times with Christina Ra, Tesla’s spokeswoman at the time, and Ted Merendino, a Tesla product planner at the company’s headquarters in California. They told me that the loss of battery power when parked overnight could be restored by properly “conditioning” the battery, a half-hour process, which I undertook by sitting in the car with the heat on low, as they instructed. That proved ineffective; the conditioning process actually reduced the range by 24 percent (to 19 miles, from 25 miles). Broder goes on to provide his own point-by-point response to Musk's allegations. Check it out at NYTimes.com &gt; FREE AppDownload
