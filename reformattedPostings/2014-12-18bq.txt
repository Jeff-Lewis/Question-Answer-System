 There's a growing disturbing trend on Wall Street. More leveraged loan buyers are increasingly "blacklisting" investors they don't like and preventing them from investing in their loans, Bloomberg's Nabila Ahmed and Kristen Haunss reported. And according to Ahmed and Haunss, it's not just the little guys who are making the blacklist. Hedge fund giants Fortress Investment Group, Highland Capital Management, and Cerberus Capital were all blocked from investing in RBS Holding Company's $155 million Quadriga Art loan last year. Companies tend to blacklist investors who are known to be tough on debt restructuring, affiliated with a competitor, or, simply, on the company's bad side, they reported. This phenomenon, which seems to have took off back in the 1990s, is surprisingly widespread.  Some 77% of loans made last quarter allowed borrowers to block specific investors, while last year, the number was only 51%, the reporter said. Blacklisting can be a problem because it cuts down on potential buyers, meaning the loans can become difficult to trade. Read the whole story at Bloomberg.com.   FREE AppDownload
