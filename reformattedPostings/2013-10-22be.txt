Stocks are quickly heading higher following a lackluster jobs report and slightly better-than-expected construction spending and east-coast manufacturing data this morning. The U.S. economy only added 148,000 nonfarm payrolls in September, below the consensus Wall Street forecast for 180,000. Construction spending rose 0.6% in August (0.4% expected), while the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index unexpectedly rose to 1 (0 expected). The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a new all-time high 1759, up 0.8% from yesterday's close. Gold is 1.6% higher, trading near $1337 an ounce, while 10-year U.S. Treasury futures are 0.5% higher (the yield on the 10-year note is 8 basis points lower at 2.52%).
