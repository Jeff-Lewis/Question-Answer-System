Still, here's what's going on: Morning!  Futures are tracking better in the USA, up 20bp, but off overnight highs.  The DAX has just slipped to unchanged, despite Germany’s ZEW coming in stronger – and EU fins up 1% on the back of tighter spreads in the PIIGs.  IN Asia, the Nikkei gave back small after jumping 5% since Friday AM, but Nikkei Futures are jumping almost 1.5% right now on the back of a weaker Yen.  Emerging Asia was strong again, with Philippines and Indonesia up well over 1%.  China added 40bp, but focus remains on the “cash crunch” there and stronger Home Prices.  The Aussie Markets remained under pressure on the back of a weaker resource sector.   Japan’s 10YY remains rangebound, as their 20Y auction was strong, indicating volatility dropping in the Credit Sector.  The US 10YY is jumping back to 2.2% ahead of the Fed’s 2 day meeting – so we need to watch for underperformance from Homebuilders, Utilities, REITS and Staples.   The DXY is showing some legs as well, providing a natural headwind for commodities - Oil retreating from a 9m high ahead of Inventory Data, while the discount to Brent has evaporated towards $7, pressuring margins at refiners.  Metals are mostly weaker, with Copper under pressure from lack of Chinese demand – and Gold dropping almost 1% as physical demand in Asia has deteriorated quickly into a slow season.
