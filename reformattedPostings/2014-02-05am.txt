In 1832, five Yale students — including future President William Howard Taft's father — founded one of America's most famous secret societies: Skull and Bones. Since then, the group has come to signify all that both mesmerizes and repulses the public about the elite. Each year, only 15 seniors are "tapped," or chosen, for lifetime membership in the club.  A windowless building on 64 High St., the "Tomb," serves as the club's headquarters. The roof is a landing pad for a private helicopter, according to Alexandra Robbins' book, "Secrets of the Tomb." For that perk and others, Bonesmen must swear total allegiance to the club.

They also agree to give part of their estates to the club. But, in return, they receive the promise of lifelong financial stability — so they won't feel tempted to sell the club's secrets, Robbins writes. Until 1971, the organization published annual rosters, kept on file at the university's library. While most recent members of the society remain tight-lipped about those secrets, we at least know the identities of some of most powerful Bonesmen. Among those business titans, poets, politicians, and three U.S. Presidents, we picked the honor roll. Thornton McEnery contributed research to this article. FREE AppDownload
