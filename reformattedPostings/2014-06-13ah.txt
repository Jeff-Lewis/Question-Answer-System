Cora DrimusIf a picture is worth a thousands words, then amateur photographer Cora Drimus' latest project speaks volumes about the history of New York City. Drimus created the video "Once Upon a Time in New York" after her visit to the city this past April. The video includes photographs taken by Drimus of present-day New York landmarks juxtaposed with historic photos of the same landmarks. Viewers are able to see how much the city has changed over the years. Drimus has created three similar videos in Romania, and currently lives in Zurich, Switzerland. FREE AppDownload
