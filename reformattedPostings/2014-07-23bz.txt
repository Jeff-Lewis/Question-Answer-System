"An examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Deutsche Bank AG's giant U.S. operations suffer from a litany of serious financial-reporting problems that the lender has known about for years but not fixed, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal," reported the WSJ's David Enrich, Jenny Strasburg and Eyk Henning. "In a letter to Deutsche Bank executives in December, a senior official with the New York Fed wrote that reports produced by some of the bank's U.S. arms 'are of low quality, inaccurate and unreliable. The size and breadth of errors strongly suggest that the firm's entire U.S. regulatory reporting structure requires wide-ranging remedial action.'" Chrysler Recall. "Chrysler Group LLC said on Tuesday it is recalling 792,300 older-model Jeep SUVs for ignition switch problems, the second recall of its kind for the No. 3 U.S. automaker this year," reported Reuters Bernie Woodall. "This brings to 1.68 million the number of vehicles Chrysler has recalled for ignition switches that can be bumped out of the "on" position by a driver's knee, which can cause the engine to shut off and disable air bags."
