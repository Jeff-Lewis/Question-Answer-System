REUTERS/Brian SnyderRichard FisherROME (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve may start raising rates around the spring of 2015, at the earlier end of market expectations, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said on Thursday. "It's assumed in the market place that we'll start our liftoff in raising interest rates some time between the spring and the summer," Fisher, a member of the Federal open Market Committee, the Fed's main policy making body said at a conference in Rome. "I won't say what we're saying internally, that would not be appropriate, but maybe sooner rather than later," he said. Financial markets will eventually test European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's commitment to do "whatever it takes" to protect the euro, Fisher said. "There used to be a saying, 'Don't fight the Fed'. Well now it's 'Don't fight Draghi' and the question is will markets test that," Fisher, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's main policy making body, said at a conference in Rome.    "I've always assumed that markets will test the Fed or the ECB and you can't just assume it will go on forever," he said.     Referring to the United States, Fisher also said that ultra-accommodative monetary policy had fueled a boom on financial markets that risked creating bubbles in some areas. "We're beginning to see extreme risk taking in the junk bond markets," he said. (Reporting by Gavin Jones and James Mackenzie) FREE AppDownload
