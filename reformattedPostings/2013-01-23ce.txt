Coach just came out with earnings. EPS missed expectations at $1.23 vs. estimates of $1.26. Same-store sales fell 2%, vs. expectation of an increase of over 2%. The stock is off about 10% pre-market. But here's the weird thing. They were apparently leaked early by an article in WomensWearDaily. The article is gated, but a note from JPMorgan that we got about an hour ago had the details in there. COH – WWD Article Published Overnight Citing Interview w/COH Appears To Have FQ2 Earnings Results In It (COH is Scheduled To Report @ 7amET Today) SSS, GM &amp; EPS All Miss St.  ·         FQ2 NA SSS dn 2% vs. St. +2.7%, JPM +2.3%  ·         FQ2 EPS $1.23 vs. St. $1.29  ·         FQ2 GM flat/72.2% vs. St. 72.4%, JPM 72.7%           CEO L. Frankfort gave an exclusive interview to WWD  ·         The “disappointing” results were pulled down by the co’s women’s handbag business in NA where SSS were down 2% which were offset by strength in Int’l (China SSS up DD%). COH acknowledged new competitors but said that macroeconomic factors (i.e. impact of Hurricane Sandy, fiscall cliff, etc.) &amp; the decision not to promote even as competitors increased markdowns played a role.  ·         Article says that “Coach reported weaker than expected Q2 earnings today &amp; turned in its first quarterly negative same-store-sales figure since the recession hit.” FREE AppDownload
