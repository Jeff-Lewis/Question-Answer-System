The criteria for the best-sellers market isn't just one where home prices are expected to appreciate the most; instead, three distinct characteristics make a city a good place for home sellers. The opposite is true for buyers' markets. Sellers have an edge on the West Coast as supply remains tight and demand is strong on the back of a stronger job market; the East Coast gives buyers an edge as homes end up on the market longer.  “In general, buyers in sellers' markets this spring can expect tight inventory, increased competition, and a greater sense of urgency," said Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries in a news release. "Sellers in buyers' markets may need to be prepared to lower their asking price, or to wait longer for the perfect buyer to come along."
