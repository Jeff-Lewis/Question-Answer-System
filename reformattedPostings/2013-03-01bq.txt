APGoldman Sachs threw a party last month at Pier 36 in the Lower East Side to celebrate its new partner class, Daily Intelligencer's Kevin Roose reports. The investment bank hasn't thrown a party after its partner dinner since 2006.   The reason the bank didn't hold parties in 2008 or 2010 is because some "might have found it offensive," a Goldman source told Roose.  Lavish parties across Wall Street pretty much disappeared after the financial crisis hit. Roose also found an Instagram user, who was at the gala and posted photos of the super swanky event.  She described the party as being like the "Golden Globes of investment banking!" Being named a partner at Goldman is a huge deal. It's one of the most highly coveted titles on Wall Street and it comes with its own set of perks, including a hefty paycheck and now, it seems, a really nice party.    Read the rest of Roose's scoop at the Daily Intelligencer &gt; FREE AppDownload
