This amazing visualization provides a guided tour of a day in UK airspace. Each year NATS - a UK air traffic control service -  manages around 2.2 million movements, peaking at over 8,000 a day (although there are around 7,000 on this particular day), with only 5.5 seconds delay per flight attributable to NATS.
