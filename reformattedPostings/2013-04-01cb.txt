APPeak oil is dead. We told you what that will mean for the U.S. economy. But what about the rest of the world? Quartz's Steve LeVine was the first to write why this could spell big trouble for OPEC. We also reported last month that Norway's foreign minister believes America's shale boom could rearrange the Middle East's balance of power.  But we wanted to go one step further and hone in on what the end of peak oil means for one of America's all-time frenemies: Saudi Arabia. The kingdom still rules the oil world in every major stat: production (11.2 million barrels a day), exports (8.5 million barrels a day), and largest oil deposit (the Ghawar field at an estimated 70 billion barrels). But with the help of some charts from AEI's Mark Perry, who's been chronicling America's energy boom better than anyone, and the now-instant classic note, "The End Is Nigh [for rising oil demand]" from Citi's Seth Kleinman and Ed Morse, we bring you 10 charts that should scare the crude out of the Saudis.
