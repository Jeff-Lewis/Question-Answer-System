Several other major stock market indexes have gone vertical in recent days to new record highs including the S&amp;P 400 MidCaps (up 165.4% since March 9, 2009), S&amp;P 600 SmallCaps (175.1), S&amp;P 500 Transportation (161.3), and Russell 2000 (160.1). The bull may be getting old, but you have to respect the strength and breadth of its most recent charge. The bull’s stamina has been based on performance-enhancing earnings. The forward earnings of the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 400, and S&amp;P 600 all rose to fresh record highs during the week of January 17, and are up 80.7%, 85.8%, and 102.7%, respectively, since the week of May 7, 2009. Actual revenues and operating earnings stopped growing on a y/y basis during Q3-2012. However, I’m expecting that better global economic growth will boost both of them this year. Stocks remain relatively cheap. Since the start of the bull market, valuations have been held down by fears of a double dip in the US, a hard landing in China, and a meltdown in Europe. If these concerns diminish this year, as I expect, there is room for higher multiples, especially for the S&amp;P 500 (selling at 13.1 times forward earnings on Friday) as well as the S&amp;P 400 (15.3) and the S&amp;P 600 (15.9).Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Performance-Enhanced Bull.  (1) Paying respects to Rodney Dangerfield.
