Asher B. DurandIt should be a very big week for the economy and world markets. A few reasons for that. First, there's lots of data. As you can see on this calendar, we'll be getting Services ISM, the ADP Jobs Report, Consumer Credit, Non-Farm Payrolls, The Trade Balance, and the Fed Beige Book. Then beyond that, it's a huge week for central banks. From Michael McDonough, among the central banks that will act this week are: The ECB, The Bank of Japan, the Bank of Indonesia, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Bank of England. Beyond that, it should be big in terms of budget politics in the US and parliamentary politics in Italy, both of which have the potential to move markets. Also, watch for headlines out of China's National People's Congress, which is in session. FREE AppDownload
