The Chinese stock market took a hit Thursday after its banking regulator issued new regulations to tighten control over banks' wealth management products (WMPs).  WMPs are essentially a pool of securities (trust products, bonds, stock funds) that have yield that is on average 2 percentage points higher than bank deposits. They are sold as low-risk investments but often are not so.  With a dearth of investment alternatives, WMPs have grown incredibly popular in China in the past few years, reaching 13 trillion yuan ($2.1 trillion) at the end of 2012, a 50 percent year-over-year increase, according to Fitch. WMPs have been creating risks in the banking sector and some have called it "ponzi finance": REUTERS To lower these risks, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) announced three key regulations to monitor WMPs (via Societe Generale's Wei Yao): Yao however thinks banks have been preparing for this, and writes that the new policy isn't intended to "devastate banks, but to cap future risks."
