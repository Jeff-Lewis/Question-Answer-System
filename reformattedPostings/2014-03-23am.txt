REUTERS/Osman OrsalTurkey's economy is expected to have grown 3.9% year-over-year in 2013, and is forecast to rise 3.9% this year.

In a Financial Times column, Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma writes that since 1960, 15 large economies "have run a current account deficit of this scale and duration," since the 1960. "If Turkey follows this path, its annual GDP growth will slow by half in the next five years, to barely 3 percent."

Another feature plaguing emerging markets are corrupt governments that have been blamed for the economic rout.
