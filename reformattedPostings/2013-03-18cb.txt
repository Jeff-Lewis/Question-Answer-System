Now Cyprus, an island country whose economy is a fraction of the size of Greece's, now threatens to stoke the euro crisis that has been dormant in recent months. This comes as the U.S. prepares for a slew of housing data and a monetary policy announcement from the federal reserve. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update The S&amp;P 500 closed last week just five points from its all-time high.  "Much of the market’s recent gains have come from multiple expansion rather than higher earnings expectations," writes Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker in a note published Sunday night.  "Most likely, this reflects central banks’ aggressive liquidity injections, which have translated into an increasing conviction among investors that major tail risks have been indefinitely removed.
