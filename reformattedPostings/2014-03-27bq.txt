Reuters / Steve MarkusActivist investor Daniel Loeb, who runs Third Point LLC, once got in a dispute with the moms in 15 Central Park West over the temperature of the swimming pool, author Michael Gross writes in his new book "House Of Outrageous Fortune." Central Park West has a 75-foot lap pool. That's definitely an amenity in New York City since it's difficult to find a decent sized lap pool.  Loeb, who competes in triathlons and has braved the 50-something degree water in the San Francisco Bay—likes the water cold. Most triathletes would agree with him on this one. They want the pool cold for swimming long distances. Naturally, the moms and kids, who most likely aren't completing a 2-mile swim workout, enjoy a warmer pool.  According to Gross, a questionnaire was sent out to the residents of the building about the pool's temperature among other fitness center issues.  The moms were victorious in the pool temperature battle, according to Gross. UPDATE: They actually reached a compromise in the building where the pool temp would be set at 81 degrees until 10 a.m. and then move up to 84—5 over the course of the day to accommodate children and their moms, Business Insider has learned. Both sides can declare "victory" on this one.  15 CPW FREE AppDownload
