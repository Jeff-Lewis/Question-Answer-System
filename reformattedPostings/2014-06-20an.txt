REUTERSFor most occupations, your risk of dying on the job is higher if you're an American worker than if you're working in Europe. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has an article in their Monthly Labor Review journal that compares rates of fatal occupational injuries in the United States and in the European Union.  Overall, BLS found that there were 3,353 fatal injuries at private employers in Europe in 2010, and 2,530 in the United States. This makes for a rate of 2.8 fatalities per 100,000 employees in Europe and 3.1 per 100,000 in the United States. BLS also broke injury rates down by occupation. For each occupational group except for finance and insurance, and professional, scientific, and technical services, death rates at work were higher in America than in Europe. In particular, the rates of fatal injuries among agricultural, forestry, and fishing workers; water supply and waste management workers; and transportation and storage workers were all about twice as high in the United States as in the European Union: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from BLS For more details on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' methodology, check out the Monthly Labor Review report here.
