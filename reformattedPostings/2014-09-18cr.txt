In opening deals, London's benchmark FTSE 100 benchmark index gained just 0.01 percent at 6,781.84 points, around one hour after Scots began voting. Frankfurt's DAX 30 added 0.43 percent to 9,703.10 points and the Paris CAC 40 index won 0.20 percent to stand at 4,440.33 points compared with Wednesday's close. Wall Street had rallied to a fresh record on Wednesday after the US Federal reserve stuck to its slow-but-steady plans to tighten monetary policy. "Markets have opened tentatively higher this morning following gains in the US as the Federal Reserve pledge to keep interest rates near zero for what they term a considerable time," said Andy McLevey, head of dealing at broker Interactive Investor. "Any gains are likely to be muted though as the people of Scotland go to the polls to determine whether they go it alone and vote for independence or remain part of the UK. "Until the results are known early tomorrow morning many investors will be sitting on the sidelines."   FREE AppDownload
