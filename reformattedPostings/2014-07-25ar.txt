El Pollo LocoShares of El Pollo Loco, the fire-grilled chicken specialists, were up as much as 55% as they made their NASDAQ debut Friday. The Costa Mesa, California-based firm had sold 7.1 million shares for $15 each in its IPO, according to a statement yesterday, after offering them for $13 to $15, Bloomberg said. Friday they were trading at more than $22. That already makes their market cap larger than Potbelly's, another fast-casual chain that has seen its share price decline 62% since its debut in October. Potbelly's market cap is now $340 million compared with Pollo Loco's $540 million. Bloomberg's broader quick-service restaurant index is down 1.1% this year. El Pollo Loco was founded in western Mexico in the late '70s. It now has hundreds of restaurants, mostly concentrated in the southwest but with some franchises elsewhere.  FREE AppDownload
