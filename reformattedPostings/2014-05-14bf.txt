John Burns Real Estate ConsultingWhat's driving demand? From 2005 to 2012, single-family rental homes grew 1.7% per year, primarily due to: Two misconceptions A common misunderstanding is the magnitude of institutional investor purchases. Institutional investors comprise less than 1% of the industry. Today, this market remains highly fragmented and largely dominated by local mom-and-pop operators who have boots-on-the-ground knowledge and will continue to be the ones collecting monthly rent checks. Another misconception is the fear of local real estate markets suffering large price declines when investors decide to liquidate their investments. While we acknowledge that the next downturn is likely to be exacerbated by investor selling, consider the following: Looking forward Investors both large and small have taken a significant ownership position in the housing stock of this country. We anticipate further consolidation in the single-family housing market as smaller regional operators with local knowledge are acquired by larger national operators. The economies of scale gained from these acquisitions will begin to evolve, and cost savings in the form of lower operating expenses and competitive rents will benefit both landlord and renters, creating a sustainable asset class for years to come.
