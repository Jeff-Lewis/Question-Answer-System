Bryce Canyon National Park UtahGood morning and welcome to a new week! This is expected to be a pretty quiet week in the world of economics and markets. Earnings season is coming to an end. There's no major central bank meeting. And there isn't much economic data to key off of. Fittingly, markets are off to a quiet start this weekend. Across Europe stocks are down just slightly. Same with US futures. Japan, however, did stage a solid 1.3% rally. FREE AppDownload
