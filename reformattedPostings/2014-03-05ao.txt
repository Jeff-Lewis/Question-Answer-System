A university official told the Wall Street Journal's Melissa Korn that Martoma, who was convicted of insider trading in February, does not hold a degree from Stanford Graduate School of Business anymore. Most convicts don't lose their degree, but it now appears Martoma got into Stanford on false pretenses. During Martoma's trial, it was revealed that Martoma was kicked out of Harvard Law School for doctoring his transcript — and then forging documents to cover his tracks (that information was never introduced into evidence during the trial).

"Stanford’s policy provides it can revoke an offer of acceptance and a degree, if it was found that an individual gained admission through false pretenses," the spokesperson told Dealbook.
