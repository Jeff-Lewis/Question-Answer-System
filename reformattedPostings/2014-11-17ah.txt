Since 1988, Wine Spectator's editors have been reviewing the best wines in the world. In 2014, they reviewed about 18,000 new wines and narrowed their list down to a manageable 100 they deemed the most “thought-provoking.” This year, the winner was surprising. Instead of the usual French or California bordeaux or chardonnay, the winning wine was a vintage port from Portugal — highly unexpected.  The ranking spans 14 countries (including the US) with an average price point of $47 (lower than last year’s $51).  Below are the 20 best wines of 2014, according to Wine Spectator, based on quality, value, availability, and "x-factor."  Dow Vintage Port ($82) Mollydooker Shiraz McLaren Vale Carnivale of Love ($75) Prats &amp; Symington Douro Chryseia ($55) Quinta do Vale Meão Douro ($76) Leeuwin Chardonnay Margaret River Art Series ($89) Castello di Ama Chianti Classico San Lorenzo Gran Selezione ($52) Clos des Papes Châteauneuf-du-Pape ($135) Brewer-Clifton Pinot Noir Sta.
