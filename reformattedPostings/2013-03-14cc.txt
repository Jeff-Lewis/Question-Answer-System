BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk was one of the first people to turn bearish on Apple. This morning he's turning bullish. He's upgrading the stock to a "buy" and giving it a 12-month price target of $540. It closed at $428.35 yesterday. Piecyk says he believes Apple will have EPS growth in 2014. This year EPS will be flat, or even possibly down. He bases the potential growth on four factors: Apple will release a cheaper iPhone, carrier upgrade policies will make it easier for users to buy new iPhones, a new product will come out, and Apple will do something with its cash. However, he also warns that Apple could miss analysts expectations this quarter, and might even miss its own guidance. That could crater the stock below $400 a share. But after that, he sees things smoothing out and improving for Apple. In April of last year he predicted Apple was going to have a bad fiscal third quarter with revenue missing expectations on light iPhone sales. He rated the stock "neutral." He was right: iPhone sales were light and revenue missed. Apple's stock still rose after that miss, but it peaked and has fallen 40 percent since. While Apple's stock has fallen, other analysts have rushed to downgrade the stock and slash their price targets. Piecyk thinks now is the time to buy.
