APOne of the more common arguments from the political right about why the recovery is so slow is that government is creating "uncertainty."  Barry explained why this is an incredibly stupid argument in a Washington Post Column. Mike Konczal over at the Next New Deal pretty much destroyed the "uncertainty index" created to show "uncertainty."  I would simply put it like this: there is always uncertainty because time is linear and we can't see into the future.   But if you really want to blame someone for creating uncertainty, look at the Republican House. Starting with the debt negotiations two years ago that resulted in a Standard and Poor's credit downgrade, to last years budget fiasco to the current situation where the House leadership literally can't get anything done, the reality is this: Republican House leadership is creating a ton of political uncertainty through their utter ineptness, from Politico: There are times when it looks like Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have no idea how to run the House Republican Conference.In just two frantic days, rank-and-file House Republicans sidelined leadership’s plan to fund the government and take another nonbinding, quixotic vote on defunding President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. These Republicans said the leadership plan is too weak, lacks a long-term strategy and is akin to waving a white flag on Obamacare. FREE AppDownload
