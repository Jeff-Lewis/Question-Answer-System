Credit AgricoleGold has been getting unceremoniously crushed since it entered a bear market in April, with levels falling below the $1,200 mark this week. At some point, one would expect the rout to swing back in the goldbug's favor, right? Wrong, according to Crédit Agricole in a new report titled "Gold — No Relief On The Horizon." "Our new end year 2013 and 2014 forecast is USD 1150 and 1050, respectively," wrote Crédit Agricole's Mitul Kotecha. High U.S. yields, a firmer dollar, and struggling India/China demand leads Crédit Agricole to believe gold will continue to get crushed. Kotecha lays all of this out in a brief presentation.
