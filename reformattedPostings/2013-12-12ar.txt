This is not accurate, according to Fidelity.  "At this time, Fidelity does not allow investments in the Bitcoin Investment Trust through our retail platform, including in IRAs," a Fidelity spokesman told Business Insider in an email. At one point, accredited investors with IRA accounts did have access.  But Fidelity says that is no longer the case. To be an an accredited investor, you had to be worth more than $1 million — excluding your primary residence — or have made over $200,000 a year for the past two consecutive years. Basically, you had to be someone like venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, an owner of the Golden State Warriors, who announced his Bitcoin retirement account last week: According to my family office, I am the first person to have bought BTC thru my Fidelity IRA. Long live tax free compounding! SecondMarket's Barry Silbert said in a statement:   "The Bitcoin Investment Trust was previously approved by Fidelity as an eligible investment for accredited clients in their self-directed IRA accounts and investments began closing last week.  We understand that Fidelity has decided to reevaluate this decision."   However, since at least November, investment management firms PENSCO and Entrust have also offered Bitcoin retirement options, according to SecondMarket — although here again, you must be an accredited investor, according to SecondMarket. Widespread retirement on your Bitcoin savings could happen some day. But it's still in a pretty nascent, amorphous stage. FREE AppDownload
