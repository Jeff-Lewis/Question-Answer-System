Dr Ed's Blog Falling oil prices along with the slow pace of global economic growth are weighing on analysts’ estimates for S&amp;P 500 revenues and earnings. They’ve lowered their revenue growth rates for 2014 and 2015 to 3.4% and 3.0% as of the week of December 4. At the beginning of October, when the price of oil was just starting to crash, they were predicting 3.9% and 4.2%.  Their estimates for earnings growth were 7.9% and 12.4% for this year and next year at the start of October. Now they are estimating 7.0% and 9.3%. They’ve slashed their estimate for Q4-2014 by 6.5% since then down to $29.91, slightly below Q3’s $30.06. That’s the S&amp;P 500’s biggest decline since Q1-2009. Most of these downward revisions are attributable to the slashing of revenues and earnings estimates by energy industry analysts.  Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Slipping in the Oil Patch? (1) The global growth question.
