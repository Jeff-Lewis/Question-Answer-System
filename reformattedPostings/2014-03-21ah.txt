REUTERS/Brian SnyderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was likely just repeating the views of private analysts and investors when she said the central bank could raise interest rates six months after ending a bond-buying program, a top policymaker said on Friday. "On the 'considerable period' being six months, the surveys that I had seen from the private sector had that kind of number penciled in," St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said during a lunch with journalists. "That wasn't very different from what we had heard from financial markets. So, I just think she's just repeating that." Bullard's remarks were the first by a Fed policymaker since Yellen made her comments on Wednesday. (Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Paul Simao) FREE AppDownload
