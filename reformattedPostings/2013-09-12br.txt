The ugly move comes after the yoga-pants maker said comparable-store sales climbed by 8% in its fiscal Q2. However, management slashed its full-year sales and earnings estimates. "Lululemon same-store sales peaked 13 quarters ago," tweeted retail expert Brian Sozzi. From the outlook section of the company's earnings announcement: For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect net revenue to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million based on a comparable-store sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the quarter. This assumes 146.0 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and a tax rate of 30.0%. For the full fiscal 2013, we now expect net revenue to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.635 billion and diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.94 to $1.97 for the full year. This assumes 146.0 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and a tax rate of 30.0%. "We are well on our way to finishing 2013 as a much stronger company than when the year began," said lululemon's Christine Day. "I am confident that the leadership currently in place coupled with a new CEO will have tremendous success leveraging the platform for growth." FREE AppDownload
