Earlier we reported on a new Pew survey showing fewer and fewer Europeans have a favorable view of the European Union, which has become a victim of the ongoing economic crisis. The survey notes particularly the sad state of affairs in France, where a deep economic gloom is setting in. These two charts from the report show how there's been a total collapse in optimism in recent years in France (even in just the last year) and how the economy is looking more like that of a peripheral nation than a strong nation like Germany.
