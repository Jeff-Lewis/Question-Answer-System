REUTERS/Jeff Kowalsky/FilesGM has announced a dividend of $0.30 a share. It's the automaker's first dividend since May 2008. Over the weekend, GM execs hinted the dividend was coming but did not specify a timetable. In 2009, the U.S. government took over management of the firm as it faced bankruptcy. It re-floated its shares in 2010 with the largest IPO in U.S. history. Last month, the Treasury department sold its last share of GM equity. U.S. taxpayers took a $10.5 billion loss. Shares are up 3% in after-hours trading. FREE AppDownload
