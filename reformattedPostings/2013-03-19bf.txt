APFollowing reports earlier that Cypriot finance minister Michael Sarris had offered his resignation while on a trip to Moscow, now there are conflicting reports saying that was false. Via Bloomberg, Reuters is reporting that Sarris says there is no truth to the reports about his resignation. Earlier, Bloomberg and Reuters reported that Cyprus finance minister Michael Sarris has resigned, citing Market News International. Sky News cited sources as well, saying this is the case. Sarris is in Moscow today to meet with Russian officials over the Cyprus bank bailout, so the timing of the reports seem very odd. CNBC also reported that Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades won't accept the resignation. ALERT: Cyprus Finance Minister offers to resign, resignation yet to be accepted. Greek newspaper Kathimerini had its own report, saying, "Sarris is about to be replaced upon his return from his current trip to Moscow, Kathimerini understands, as he no longer enjoys the support of President Nicos Anastasiades following his handling of the crisis." This is getting interesting. FREE AppDownload
