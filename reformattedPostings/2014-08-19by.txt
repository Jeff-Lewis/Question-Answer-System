BAKOKO / FlickrResidential construction activity in the U.S. is bouncing back. The pace of housing starts jumped 15.7% to a 1.093 million unit rate in July, smashing expectations for a pace of 965,000. Permits jumped 8.1% to 1.052 million. Economists were expecting a pace of 1.052 million. Demand for single-family units was up, but demand for multi-family units continues to boom. Building permits for structures with five or more units (e.g. apartment buildings) jumped 23.6%. Starts surged 33.0%. All of this confirms Monday's better-than-expected NAHB housing market sentiment report. “As the employment picture brightens, builders are seeing a noticeable increase in the number of serious buyers entering the market,” said the NAHB's Kevin Kelly.
