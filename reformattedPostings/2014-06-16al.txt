Justin Sullivan / Getty General Motors said it is recalling 3.16 million cars with model years 2000-2014 to rework or replace ignition keys. The company will also take a charge of up to $700 million in the second quarter, including a previously disclosed $400 million charge.  This latest recall brings the company's total vehicles recalled in the U.S. to 17.73 million, with total North American recalls now totaling 20,042,649 vehicles, since the company's first recall in January. According to its latest monthly sales report, General Motors' seasonally adjusted May sales was an estimated 16.5 million units. In May, GM's sales were up 13% to 284,694 vehicles, with retail sales that were up 10%.  The only model being recalled that is still in production is the previous generation Chevy Impala, sold to rental fleets as the Impala Limited.  GM said it is aware of eight crashes and six injuries related to this recall, which is the result of a review of ignition issues following the February recall of 2.6 million Chevy Cobalts. Here's the full release from GM: DETROIT – General Motors will rework or replace the ignition keys on about 3.16 million 2000 to 2014 model year cars in the U.S. because the ignition switch may inadvertently move out of the “run” position if the key is carrying extra weight and experiences some jarring event. The use of a key with a hole, rather than a slotted key, addresses the concern of unintended key rotation due to a jarring road event, such as striking a pothole or crossing railroad tracks. Only one of the models included in the U.S. recall of 3,160,725 cars is still in production – the previous generation Chevrolet Impala, which is sold to daily rental fleets as the Impala Limited. The total North America population – U.S., Canada, Mexico and exports – is 3,360,555. The safety recall follows a review of ignition issues following the recall in February of 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars. GM is aware of eight crashes and six injuries related to this recall. If the ignition switch moves out of the “run” position, there is an effect on power steering and power braking. In addition, the timing of the key movement out of the “run” position, relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of the crash event, may result in the air bags not deploying. The cars being recalled are the: Buick Lacrosse MY 2005-2009 Chevrolet Impala MY 2006-2014 Cadillac Deville MY 2000–2005 Cadillac DTS MY 2004–2011 Buick Lucerne MY 2006–2011 Buick Regal LS &amp; GS MY 2004–2005 Chevy Monte Carlo MY 2006–2008 In these vehicles, the ignition switch may be unable to handle extra weight hanging on a slotted key. GM will add an insert to the ignition keys of the recalled vehicles to close the slot and leave a 4x6-millimeter hole through which the key ring could be attached. In vehicles where the key cover has been worn, new keys with holes instead of slots will be provided free of charge. Rework of the keys – adding key inserts – at GM dealerships is expected to begin in the next few weeks. Until the rework or replacement is completed, owners of the recalled cars are urged to remove additional weight from their key chains and drive with only the ignition key. In addition to the ignition key recall, GM also announced U.S. recalls for 165,770 vehicles in these five actions: GM expects to take a charge of up to approximately $700 million in the second quarter for the cost of recall-related repairs announced in the quarter. This amount includes a previously disclosed $400 million charge for recalls announced May 15 and May 20. And this graphic from GM shows the full list of vehicles it has recalled since January.
