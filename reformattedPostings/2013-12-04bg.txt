Is this the beginning of a significant correction? I doubt it since corrections and bear markets are triggered by mounting concerns about a recession. The latest data are pointing more to a boom than a bust. I’m not sure if the folks at the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) have changed their mind yet about the economy being in a recession. Their Weekly Leading Indicator sure doesn’t show it. Neither does the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicator, which rose to a cyclical high during October. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index remains subdued with a reading of 5.1 yesterday. However, November’s M-PMI was surprisingly strong, causing some economic truthers to question its accuracy. I expressed some of my doubts yesterday as well. But then auto sales came out for November, showing that they spiked up to a new cyclical high of 16.4 million units. However, this may be partly a rebound from October’s sales, which were depressed by the partial shutdown of the federal government. The two-month average was 15.8 million units, a slight uptick from the third quarter’s 15.7 million units. Another upbeat indicator was yesterday’s construction report showing that total construction put in place also rose to a new cyclical high, though it remains 25% below the record high during March 2006.
