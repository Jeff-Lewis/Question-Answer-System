Flickr/bookemspookyGood morning! After touching record highs yesterday, US futures are a lower in overnight action. European stocks are down as well. Germany is off 0.4%. Italy is down 0.3%. France is off 0.5%. French Business Confidence came out and slightly missed expectations. The big loser of the day is China, as the Shanghai Composite shed another 2%, and the Chinese Yuan continued to reverse from its traditional course of only going higher. Today in the US we get the Case-Shiller housing market index. FREE AppDownload
