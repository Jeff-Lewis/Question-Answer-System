Growth in the US is picking up as Europe, Japan, and the emerging markets slow. In its latest monthly Global Economic Outlook and Strategy report, Citi's Willem Buiter and his team downgrade the firm's expectation for global growth after "notable downgrades" to several emerging markets including Brazil, China, and Russia. "Our global growth forecasts continue to drift down, and we are cutting 0.1 percent off our 2015 forecast this month, and now look for global GDP growth of 2.8% this year and 3.3% for 2015 (at current exchange rates)," Buiter wrote. "This is the second consecutive monthly downgrade to our 2015 growth forecast, while in total we have cut our 2014 forecast by 0.5 percent (from 3.3% to 2.8%) since January." Buiter's 52-page note offers commentary on every major economy covered by Citi's army of economists. We highlight a few of the viewpoints for 36 major economies in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. We also include GDP growth forecasts through 2018. FREE AppDownload
