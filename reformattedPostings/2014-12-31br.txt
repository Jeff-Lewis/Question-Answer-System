Russia has said annual inflation hit 11.4pc in 2014, the highest level since the financial crisis of 2008. The sliding rouble — hit by lower oil prices and Western sanctions — has significantly pushed up prices, with food up by 15.4pc for the year, the state statistics service said. Inflation crept up 2.6pc in December, a month when the ruble experienced a dramatic crash on December 18, falling by 20pc in a single day and triggering fears of a full-blown bank run. The currency has stabilised over the past week between 50 and 60 roubles to the dollar - more than 40pc weaker than at the beginning of the year. Russia's inflation in 2013 was 6.5pc. The economy — sluggish for the past two years — was dealt a double blow this year as oil prices reached a five-year low and Western countries imposed sanctions over Moscow's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, cutting off Russia's banking system from foreign lending. As a result, the economy shrank in November for the first time in five years, and is expected to enter recession in the first quarter of 2015. Russians' real earnings also fell. Officials expect the economy to shrink by 4pc next year if oil trades at $60 a barrel. The rouble's decline has sparked fears about Russian companies and their ability to service billions of dollar-denominated debt, while the Russian central bank has raised interest rates to 17pc, sacrificing growth in order to protect the currency. Mr Putin this month conceded tough times were ahead and did not issue any roadmap for recovery, merely saying that the economy will rebound by 2017 in line with global trends. FREE AppDownload
