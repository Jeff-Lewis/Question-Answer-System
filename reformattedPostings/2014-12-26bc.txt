This has been a remarkable year for US equities – not just in terms of the handsome return for investors (15% for the S&amp;P so far) but also because of how this was delivered. This is a market that, in 2014, Traditional fundamental factors are challenged when it comes to explaining such an outcome. Most importantly, while the U.S. economic situation has notably improved this year and is now starting to deliver more inclusive gains, this much-awaited progression has been far from linear. In addition, there is the dampening reality of a weakening global economy, geo-political tensions and precipitous moves in currency and commodity markets. To explain the impressive equity market performance, we also need to appeal to other factors – specifically, to central banks and the deployment of idle cash. Throughout the year, central banks have remained equity investors’ best friends. Fearing spiking market volatility as much as risk-averse investors do, they repeatedly responded to periodic market jitters through a combination of re-assuring statements and, in the case of foreign central banks, further monetary policy easing. In the process, they consistently signaled to markets that they would rather overdo monetary stimulus than tighten pre-maturely. Such reassurances were instrumental in attracting lots of money into the marketplace, and not only from households but also companies. In addition to large share buybacks and higher dividend payouts, this year has seen a significant increase in M&amp;A activity with the vast majority of transactions taking place well above prevailing market prices. In celebrating what has been a truly impressive year for US equities, investors have much more than fundamentals to be thankful for; and, along with further economic improvements, the durability of the other two factors is key to building on the impressive gains in the new year.
