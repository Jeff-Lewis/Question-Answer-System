Legendary investor Carl C. Icahn has just written his first blog post for Yahoo Finance advocating for more shareholder activism.  He has also included a chart in response to those who "question the efficacy of including activists' designees on public company Boards of Directors." The chart shows what would have happened if investors put their money in companies in which Icahn had someone on the board. According to Icahn, folks would have done really well. (He filed it in an 8-K too [via WSJ]) "Even more telling is the annualized return of a person who invested in 23 companies whose Boards Icahn designees joined between January 1 2009 and June 30 2014: if the person invested in each company on the date that the designee joined the Board and sold on the date that the Icahn designee left the Board (or continued to hold through June 30, 2014 if the designee did not leave the Board) they would have obtained an annualized return of 27%."  While he's had some big winners like WebMd and eBay, he's also had some losers like Voltari Corp. and Dynegy.
