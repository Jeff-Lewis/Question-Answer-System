Monday was "Single's Day" in China. What's Single's Day you ask? Our Haley Peterson described it last week as essentially a protest to Valentine's Day. Instead of celebrating your love, you celebrate being single. It started in the 1990s. And like all holidays, it's now become a gigantic excuse for shopping and sales. In fact, it's the single biggest one-day online shopping day anywhere in the world. Xinhua.com describes the activity this year: Taobao.com, a key sales platform under Alibaba Group, operator of China's biggest e-commerce platforms, launched a shopping festival on its consumer-oriented platform, Tmall.com, highlighting big discounts on Singles' Day. Journalists from more than 200 news outlets waited at the data broadcast hall of the company's headquarters in east China's Hangzhou City early Monday morning to witness its sales data soaring on a huge electronic screen. The applause roared as revenues topped 10 billion yuan at 6 a.m., when more than 100 million consumers had placed orders via the online portal. On the same day last year, it took 13 hours for the company's sales to top the 10-billion RMB benchmark. Here's an image of the journalists watching online sales explode on a giant monitor.
