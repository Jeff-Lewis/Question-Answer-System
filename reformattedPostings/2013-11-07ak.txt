The stock is down in after-hours trading after the company missed analyst estimates on revenue and gave worse than expected guidance.  An immediate 10% after-hour drop followed a 5% drop during the day. Since September the stock has been falling. But, after the company's earnings call the stock made a comeback and was up ~1.5%. The stock's turnaround seems to be thanks to a new plan to allow more sellers on the platform.
