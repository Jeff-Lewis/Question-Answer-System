REUTERS/Mike BlakeHomebuilder sentiment surged in November. The latest housing market index from the National Association of Homebuilders came in at 58 in November, topping expectations. Expectations were for the index, which measures sentiment among homebuilders, to rise slightly to 55 from 54 last month.  November's reading brings the index back to within a point of its 59 hit in September, which marked a post-crisis high.  In a note to clients following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro cautioned that while the report looks good, this has overstated housing activity in recent years.  "The long-term relationship between NAHB headline and the official new home sales numbers points to sale of around 750,000," Shepherdson writes. "But the survey has substantially overstated sales in the past couple of years." FREE AppDownload
