Getty Images/Ethan MillerTwitter's stock fell after hours, as investors were disappointed by Twitter's user numbers.  Here's a look at Twitter's earnings versus expectations:  The stock is down 11% in reaction to the numbers, dragging it to its all-time lows.  Monthly users were lighter than the Street wanted, which killed the stock. On the earnings call, CEO Dick Costolo said he was "really happy" with engagement in Q1. Favorites and retweets were up 26% in the quarter, which is a sign that people are using Twitter more and more. Costolo also said that net new users were just as engaged as older users.  Costolo also tried to convince analysts that despite the small user numbers, Twitter's reach is much bigger. He said that MoPub, Twitter's mobile ad network, reaches 1 billion users across iOS and Android devices.  Costolo also rejected the idea that Twitter is a niche service. He said that there were 3.3 billion views of tweets related to the Oscars. They happened all over the place, on TV, and elsewhere.  He used this as proof that Twitter is a well-known, mainstream service. Now, all Twitter has to do is convince people that there is value in using Twitter on a daily basis.  Costolo's explanations were admirable, but fell short. When the call started, Twitter was down 8-9%. By the end of the call, it was down 10-11%.  Here's a chart looking at Twitter's user growth deceleration, via BI Intelligence: Business Insider This chart is also worrisome: Twitter Revenue&nbsp;- Revenue for the first quarter of 2014 totaled $250 million, an increase of 119% compared to $114 million in the same period last year.
