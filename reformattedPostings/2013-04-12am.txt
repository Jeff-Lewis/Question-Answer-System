Bank of America Merrill LynchThe gold price sell-off is getting downright ugly. Down 4% today, gold is now 20% from its September 2011 high, which means it's in a bear market. We've heard some ultra-bulls say with a straight face that gold was heading for the stratosphere.  For whatever reason, they argued that it could be worth multiples of where it is today.  We've heard targets from $5,000 to $10,000. There was even a rationale for gold at $46,000/Oz. With prices plummeting, we thought it would be a good time to revisit some of the wildest gold price targets we've heard in the last year.
