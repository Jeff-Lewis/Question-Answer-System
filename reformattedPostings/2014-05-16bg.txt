REUTERS/Keith Bedford (Reuters) -Darden RestaurantsInc &lt;DRI.N&gt; said it agreed to sell itsRedLobster맙eafood chain to private equity firmGolden Gate Capital맍or $2.1 billion in cash, defying pressure from an activist investor who opposed plans to shed the struggling chain. Darden's shares were up marginally before the bell. Hedge fundStarboard ValueLP had opposed a sale or spinoff ofRedLobster, saying such a move could destroy as much as $800 million of shareholder value. Darden said on Friday that it expects net cash proceeds of about $1.6 billion from the sale, of which about $1 billion would be used to retire debt. The remainder would be used to buy back up to $700 million of shares in fiscal 2015, Darden said. Darden, the biggest U.S. operator of full-service restaurants, has been battling competition from so-called "fast-casual" restaurants such as Chipotle Mexican Grill &lt;CMG.N&gt; and Panera Bread &lt;PNRA.O&gt;. RedLobster, whose same-restaurant sales have fallen in five of the last six quarters, contributed about 31 percent of Darden's total revenue in 2013. Another activist investor, Barington Capital Group LP had pressed Darden to put its more-matureRedLobsterandOlive Garden맊hains into one company, and its higher-growth chains, includingLongHorn Steakhouse마ndCapital Grille, into another. Starboard declined to make an immediate comment, while Barington was unavailable. Darden, which expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2015, said it explored several options to separateRedLobster, but concluded that the Golden Gate deal maximized the value of the business and its real estate assets.
