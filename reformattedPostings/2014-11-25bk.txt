Kevork Djansezian/ReutersConsumer confidence unexpectedly fell in November. The Conference Board's latest consumer confidence reading came in at 88.7, down sharply from October. Expectations were for the reading to come in at 96, up from 94.5 last month.  The reading's expectations component also fell sharply, to 87.0 from 93.8 in October. October's 94.5 was a seven-year high for the index. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at Conference Board said, "Consumer confidence retreated in November, primarily due to reduced optimism in the short-term outlook. Consumers were somewhat less positive about current business conditions and the present state of the job market; moreover, their optimism in the short-term outlook in both areas has waned." And according to Reuters' Jamie McGeever, all 73 economists polled by Reuters were way off Tuesday's confidence reading, with the range of estimates coming in between 92 and 98.8.  In a note to clients following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said Tuesday's report was disappointing, but said to expect a rebound next month.  "We are inclined to see it as a lagged response to the drop in stock prices in October, which has since more than reversed, while gas prices have fallen further," Shepherdson said. "Most of the hit was in the expectations component, which is very sensitive to gas and stock prices; it fell 6.8 points, reversing a 7.4-point October jump. We expect a rebound in December and further gains early next year." FREE AppDownload
