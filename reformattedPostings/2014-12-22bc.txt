Greece’s plans to turn Piraeus port in the main trade gateway into Europe received a shot in the arm last week after China pledged to upgrade the entire train network linking it to central Europe and significantly reduce the cost and time needed to transport goods. According to the Imerisia news site (link in Greek), the investment, announced by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang last week at the summit meeting of Southeastern European leaders in Belgrade, will bolster Greece’s bid to become a rail freight hub and the goal to render Trainose, the country’s freight train network, an attractive option for multinationals to transfer cargo into central Europe.Kieqiag’s comments follow last month’s agreement between the  Piraeus Port Organization (OLP) and PCT, a subsidiary of China’s Cosco, that envisages investment plans worth €230 million in the port, which China sees a gateway to Europe and one of the fastest growing ports.The deal will allow Piraeus port to start works to expand its western side and, according to media reports, raise the eventual capacity of its container terminal to 7.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units  (teu) putting it on a path to become the main entry point for Asian trade toward Europe.Only recently Cosco added the electronics giant Sony as a fourth multinational on its list of clients. The other three multinationals that have opted for Piraeus as their entry point are China’s Huawei, ZTE Corp and Hewlett Packard. According to remarks by Sony Hellas head Yiannis Gratsonis, published in Kathimerini newspaper, the deal will expedite the transfer of cargo into Europe.GoogleMaps/Screenshot “The biggest benefit for Sony is the 10 days it gains compared with the previous route,” but stressed the need to upgrade the cargo line that starts at the port of Piraeus.“The capacity of each train is only reduced by the rail infrastructure,” Kathimerini quoted him as saying, adding that the bridges and tunnels in some neighbouring countries are not big enough to support larger trains or containers.Goods are predominantly transferred by rail to Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, and experts have been urging the government to upgrade the infrastructure to accommodate expanding freight capacities.  The port, which Athens and Beijing are calling the “new European gate for Asian imports” could, according to a National Bank of Greece study, rake in additional revenues of €900 million and around 9,000 jobs  from the expected increase to 4.7 million teu in 2015, up from 3 million in 2012Cosco is the world's leading Group specializing in global shipping, modern logistics and ship building and repairing.
