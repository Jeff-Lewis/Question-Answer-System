Wall Street investment firms are feverishly grabbing single-family homes, the Washington Post reports. Wall Street's been buzzing about this trade for a while. Institutional investors are taking advantage of cheap inventory, combined with our low interest rate environment, to make double digit returns from renting or re-selling homes. As a result, markets in some places are recovering rapidly — Phoenix, for example, has seen single-family home prices rise 23% in the past year.
