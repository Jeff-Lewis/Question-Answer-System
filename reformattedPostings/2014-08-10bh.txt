US credit growth continues to accelerate, reaching the highest year-over-year pace since the Great Recession. FRED In 2012 the growth was primarily driven by corporate debt (chart below) as banks remained cautious on real estate and consumer lending. While corporate loan growth remains strong - at around 11% per year - other sectors are now experiencing faster credit expansion. FRED In a complete contrast to the situation in the Eurozone, both real estate (particularly commercial) and consumer credit growth rates have improved materially this year. Consumer credit is no longer just driven by autos, with credit card debt picking up as well.

Consumers, companies, and banks are still fairly jittery and it won't take much to dampen the supply of and/or the demand for credit.   FREE AppDownload
