REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi Many on Wall Street are confident that the rally in equities will continue through 2015. And when investors bet that certain stocks will fall, it can be hard to tell because they are not required to disclose their short positions. But SunGard, one of the largest financial technology companies in the world, has a product called Astec Analytics, that tracks securities lending data — a proxy for short selling. Short sellers borrow stocks and they don't purchase them until the end of the trade. SunGard shared its data on the most shorted stocks in 2014 with us, broken down by sector. It includes the number of shares borrowed and the cost to do this over a year ("annualized borrowing cost"), to show how big a bet investors were willing to make on these companies. The stocks are ranked by the total amount of borrowing fees collected. SunGard then picked the most interesting stocks from the top end of the list of stocks shorted by volume. FREE AppDownload
