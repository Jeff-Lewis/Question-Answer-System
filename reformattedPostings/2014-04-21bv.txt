The product labels are incorrect as they do not reflect the ingredients associated with the pasteurized cheese in the cheese dogs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a statement on Sunday. The products were formulated with milk, which is not declared on the product label, the FSIS said. (http://r.reuters.com/dun68v) The recall is classified a Class I recall - a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. FSIS and Kraft have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Kraft was not immediately available for comment outside normal U.S. business hours.
