Nobel prize winning economist Robert Shiller warns investors that his CAPE ratio is not a good tool for timing the market. But it is good at predicting long-term returns. Having said that, everyone still knows from experience that a stretched CAPE ratio preceded the stock market crashes of the dotcom bubble and the credit crisis. CAPE is calculated by taking the S&amp;P 500 and dividing it by the average of ten years worth of earnings.  If the ratio is above the long-term average of around 16x, the stock market is considered expensive. Currently, the CAPE is at 24.42x. On Friday, John Hussman tweeted this S&amp;P 500 chart that lists all of the warning signs of a crash that we are experiencing now. And there are a lot. At the top is the CAPE. Hussman: "Anatomy of textbook pre-crash bubble. Don't rely on further blowoff, but don't be shocked. Risk dominates. Hold tight." @HussmanJP FREE AppDownload
