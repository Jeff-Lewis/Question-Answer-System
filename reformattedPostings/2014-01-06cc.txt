This 507-lb. bluefin tuna caught off northern Japan sold for 7.36 million yen ($70,324 ) at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo on Jan.5, making it the highest price paid at the market's first tuna auction of the year.  Check out this massive fish: REUTERS/Yuya Shino Kiyomura Co's President Kiyoshi Kimura (C), who runs a chain of sushi restaurants, poses for pictures with a 230 kg (507 lbs) bluefin tuna at his sushi restaurant outside Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo January 5, 2014.The wildest part is that last year the owner of a different Japanese sushi restaurant chain paid $1.76 million for a 489-lb. bluefin tuna. Svati Kiersten Narula of The Atlantic describes the Sushinomics surrounding the blufin auction, including why the price for the top fish dropped off so much. Here's a snippet:  If the past decade's trend in pricing continued, this year's first tuna would surely fetch more than a million dollars. But the Tsukiji fish market bucked tradition this weekend and sold its first tuna to Kimura, yet again, for a mere $70,000. That's still way more money than most bluefin go for in Japan. But compared to what everyone was expecting—an extravagant sum to start off the new year and remind us that these are the most prized fish in the sea—that's one crazy cheap tuna.
