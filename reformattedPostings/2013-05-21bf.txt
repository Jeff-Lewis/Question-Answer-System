Shares of Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutrition products, have been halted.  The news: Herbalife has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its new auditor. PwC will re-audit the company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to the 8-K filing with the SEC. Last month, KPMG announced it had resigned as Herbalife's auditor after one of its now-former partners shared non public information with another person. Herbalife is the stock that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is famously short.  Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife.  He has publicly called the company a "pyramid scheme." Not everyone has agreed with Ackman's short thesis. His rival, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, snapped up a massive stake in the company.  FREE AppDownload
