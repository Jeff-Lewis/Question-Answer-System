Legendary New York Stock Exchange floor trader Art Cashin, the director of floor operations for UBS Financial Services, has released his annual Wall Street Christmas poem.   The poem includes many of the year's events including the Fed, the Boston Red Sox, Anthony Weiner and Bitcoin.   It's read to the tune of "Twas The Night Before Christmas."  Check it out:   MONDAY, DECEMBER 23, 2013 A TRADITIONAL PRESENTATION   ‘Tis two days before Christmas and at each brokerage house The only thing stirring was the click of a mouse   Down on the Exchange the tape inches along Brokers bargained and traded as they hummed an old song   The Fed kept on printing yet few jobs did appear But it's time to move on so they'll taper next year   Boston won the World Series Baltimore took the Bowl But Tiger still struggles to get the ball in the hole   From Bitcoins to Binge-viewing brand new things did occur And the Prez took a selfie that caused quite a stir   There was a government shutdown most folks called it a sham And to slow down the Senate a guy read "Green Eggs and Ham"   In Cleveland three women finally freed of their fears Held captive by a mad man for nearly ten years   The Pope said he resigned an occurrence quite rare A new Pope named Francis new sits in that chair   Back tried Spitzer and Weiner they brought little to cheer But it’s Christmastime, Alice and Santa is near   So stop looking backwards have a cup of good cheer And kiss you a loved one raise your hopes for next year   And amidst all the trading Christmas themes we will heed And share our good fortune with families in need   And tomorrow they’ll pause as we wait on the bell To sing a tradition a song for old “Nell”   Don’t let this year’s problems impede Christmas Cheer Resolve to be happy throughout the New Year   And resist ye Grinch feelings let joy never stop Put the bad at the bottom keep the good on the top   So count up your blessings along with your worth You’re still living here in the best place on earth   And think ye of wonders that light children's eyes And hope Santa will bring you that Christmas surprise   So play ye a carol by Mario Lanza Unless you are waiting to celebrate Kwanzaa   Hanukkah’s over And Ramadan’s gone Different folks, different holidays yet each spirit lives on   Whatever your feast is we hope you all still Find yourself just surrounded by folks of goodwill   Tuesday, as the bell rings hark to your heart’s call And as Santa would shout Merry Christmas to All!
