Osbornb / Creative CommonsGood morning! It's Jobs Tuesday. Thanks to the government shutdown, we're having the bizarre but delightful experience of getting a Non-Farm Payrolls report on a Tuesday in the middle of the month rather than on a Friday at the beginning of the month. The number comes out at 8:30 AM as always. In the meantime, markets are doing zilch. They were flat yesterday and are flat today. For a full preview of the jobs report, see here. FREE AppDownload
