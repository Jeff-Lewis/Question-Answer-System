Australia Industry GroupAustralian PMINew data shows that Australia's manufacturing sector contracted for the twelfth straight months.  According to the Australian Industry Group, the country's manufacturing PMI came in at 45.6 in February.  Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  And this has been going on for a year. It's worth noting, however, that this number is an improvement from 40.2 in January. "Manufacturing is showing tentative signs of a pick-up following improvements in new orders, production and employment sub-indices during February, even though all remained below 50 points," wrote AIG. "Survey respondents cited a range of inhibitors, including: soft demand; weak confidence; and the strong Australian dollar. Exporters’ ongoing problems with the high dollar is evident in the exports sub-index this month, which remained close to last month’s all-time low, at just 31.2 points."
