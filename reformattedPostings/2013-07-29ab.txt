Japan just released a couple of June economic stats, and they were overall disappointing. First was June household spending, which unexpectedly fell 0.4% year-over-year.  Economists were looking for a 1.4% gain. That was followed by June industrial production, which fell 3.3% month-over-month.  Economists were looking for 1.5% decline. Japan's Nikkei is up 0.4% early in the Tuesday trading session. This follows Monday's 3.3% sell-off. Nikkei.com FREE AppDownload
