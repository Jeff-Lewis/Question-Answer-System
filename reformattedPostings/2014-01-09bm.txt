This week's Bloomberg Businessweek cover story features Bloomberg's Ashlee Vance and Brad Stone covering "The Bitcoin-Mining Arms Race." As usual, the cover of the magazine itself comes close to overshadowing the story. Check it out (the subhed reads: "Why are investors so crazy about a currency invented by a phantom?"). You can also learn about how the cover was conceived here. And check out artist Christian Riese Lassen's other work here. Bloomberg Businessweek FREE AppDownload
