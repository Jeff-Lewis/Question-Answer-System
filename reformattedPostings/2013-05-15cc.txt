The headline number fell by 0.7% month-over-month, largely due to falling energy prices.  This was a tad lower than the -0.6% rate expected by economists.  PPI climbed by 0.6% year-over-year, which was a hair higher than the 0.8% increase expected. Excluding food and energy prices, the core number was right in line with expectations increasing by 0.1% month-over-month and 1.7% year-over-year. FREE AppDownload
