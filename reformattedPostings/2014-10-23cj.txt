The quarter included $300 million in special items for flood damage sustained at the company's technical center outside Detroit and the writedown of assets in Russia. Revenue rose slightly to about $39.3 billion from $39 billion. Analysts had expected $39.8 billion. The No. 1 U.S. automaker reported a profit margin of 9.5 percent in North America, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Excluding recall-related costs, the second quarter's margin in the region was 9.2 percent.
