Today is one of the biggest shopping days of the year in the U.K., with retailers offering blowout sales similar to those offered on Black Friday in the U.S.  The holiday is called "Boxing Day" and it's usually held on Dec. 26, the day after Christmas. The sales draw huge, chaotic crowds of bargain-hunters every year.

Getty Analysts expect about $3.4 billion in sales on Boxing Day, including about $739 million in online sales, according to the Guardian.  By comparison, U.S. shoppers spent $9.7 billion on Black Friday, according to research firm ShopperTrak.
