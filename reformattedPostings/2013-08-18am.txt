In what may be an unprecedented outage, all of Google's services briefly went dark about 4:52 on Friday afternoon Pacific time.  The outage, which reportedly affected most of Google's services worldwide, led to a staggering 40% drop in global Internet traffic (pageviews), according to analytics firm GoSquared (via Eric Mack of CNET).
