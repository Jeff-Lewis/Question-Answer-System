BI IntelligenceVenmo's growth shows what kind of opportunity exists in the P2P payment space. It's expected to process more than $1 billion annually.Mobile peer-to-peer payment apps, which let people send money to one another instantly, are gaining rapid adoption in the U.S. and globally. Venmo, for example, is now processing at a run-rate of $1.6 billion in volume, according to BI Intelligence estimates. The secret to the success of these apps is that they solve a real problem for users: They give them a way to pay each other when they don't have cash or a check. For example, if you go out to dinner these apps make it easy to pay a friend back for covering the cost of your meal. In fact, among U.S. adults who use P2P payment apps, 49% say they use them for dining-related transactions, according to Nielsen. In a new report from BI Intelligence we size the opportunity for mobile P2P transactions, take a high-level look at a handful of these apps and how they work, what the opportunities are for monetization, and explore how P2P payments could be the bridge to consumer uptake of mobile payments.
