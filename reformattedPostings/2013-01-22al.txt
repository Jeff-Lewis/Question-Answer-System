Months ago, the infamous Paul Tudor Jones 'Trader' documentary resurfaced, only to disappear back into the depths internet again. So if you missed it then, grab it now from dailymotion before it's too late — last time it was only up for about a day. All the drama stems from the fact that PTJ does not like this movie. He asked PBS to stop airing after it premiered in 1987. He also, according to Wall Street lore, purchased almost all of the copies of the movie on VHS. So this movie is rare. It's very, very rare. It's basically the white stag of Wall Street.
