However, earnings season will be in full force. Apple, Microsoft, McDonald's, and Facebook are among the big names that will disclose how business performed in Q1 and how business could perform in the near future. Everyone will be listening for the impact of weather, the effects of currency fluctuations, and the evolving demand dynamics of China. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Deutsche Bank's David Bianco is one of Wall Street's more cautious strategists. Here's a summary of his recommendation from his new weekly commentary: "April’s high volatility swung the S&amp;P ~5% from an 1890 high to 1815 low. This means that investors are unsure in their macro outlooks. What’s increasingly uncertain is the degree to which growth accelerates and 10yr Treasury yields climb. We think those expecting sustained GDP growth of &gt;3% should prefer smaller growth (high PE) stocks over larger value (low PE) stocks. This outlook aligns more with an 1850 S&amp;P yearend target as yields should more quickly ascend toward normal. Those expecting GDP growth to be &lt;3% should prefer low PE mega-caps as the climb in yields should be limited and support higher fair value steady-state PEs, and could raise the S&amp;P to 2000 within 12 months."
