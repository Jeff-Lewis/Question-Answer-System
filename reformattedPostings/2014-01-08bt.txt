KraftBad news for some processed cheese lovers: Kraft is low on Velveeta. Kraft Foods Group on Tuesday said customers might not be able to find some Velveeta products on store shelves for several weeks. The announcement comes just as the cheese dip season -- aligned with the NFL playoffs -- gets into full swing. "This is really a short-term issue that's more noticeable right now given the increased seasonal demand," Kraft spokeswoman Jody Moore said in an emailed statement to the Tribune. "We have not heard many complaints from consumers so far." Moore did not elaborate on why the shortage occurred or whether it would affect other Kraft products. It was also unclear how hard-hit the Chicago market would be. The shortage was first reported by Advertising Age after a few stores on the East Coast reported running low on the product. One Brooklyn-area employee told AdAge that the store wasn't expecting shipments again until February due to a plant issue. Moore told AdAge that high driver demand was one factor contributing to the Velveeta shortage. The story was trending on Twitter Tuesday, leading some to worry about munchies for the Big Game. "@kraftfoods has announced a possible #Velveeta shortage. This will greatly impact our #SuperBowl food options," one user posted Tuesday evening. Velveeta cheese, the staple of many-a-nacho recipe, has been serving Kraft well recently. The slices and Velveeta dinner kits have boosted sales, according to the company's third-quarter earnings release. The cheese product, its name concocting a velvety smooth product that melts evenly over chips or noodles, has been around for 86 years. ehirst@tribune.com ___ (c)2014 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by MCT Information Services  FREE AppDownload
