wwitv.comCyprus President Nicos Anastasiades just addressed the nation in a dramatic Sunday night speech regarding the bailout of Cyprus, which will see a one-time tax on everyone with cash in Cypriot banks. The basic gist of his message is this: Cyprus is in a huge crisis, and the country was given two choices, blackmail style. Either the government could get no help, and see a complete collapse of the economy and the financial system, as the banks ran out of money. Or Cyprus could take the "bailout" deal, which involves the painful tax on everyone's deposits. The President believes the latter options is superior. Here are some tweets to describe what the speech from folks on the ground, including Ekathimerini editor Nick Malkoutzis. #Anastasiades: We were given 2 blackmail-style options at Eurogroup. 1 would lead to disorderly bankruptcy. The other to stabilizing system #Anastasiades: If I opposed deposit tax, our financial system would eventually collapse #Cyprus #Anastasiades: The option we chose is not the one we wanted but the least bad option #Cyprus #Anastasiades: Depositors will not lose as they will be given equity. #Cyprus Anastasiadis: those that keep deposits for two years will get half the value of the levy in securitized gas revenues #Anastasiades: Deposit tax needs Parliament's approval. I will respect parties' decision. Road ahead is not easy #Cyprus FREE AppDownload
