According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the total value of stocks in the top 60 major stock market exchanges was $62.4 trillion as of July 2014. "The United States retains its ranking as the largest global equity market with a (nominal dollar) capitalization of USD 98 trillion, with a weight of 34.6% (representing a USD 74 trillion gain since 2014), while China advances ahead of both the UK and Japan to become the second largest equity market with a USD 54 trillion capitalization and a weight of 18.9% (representing a USD 50 trillion nominal gain from 2014)," wrote Credit Suisse analysts. @CSResearch FREE AppDownload
