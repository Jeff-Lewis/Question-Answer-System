WikipediaIn honor of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam—the notoriously hard Wall Street test happening this Saturday—we've been sharing some of the best horror stories from test-takers.  A commenter named Cameron gave us is a total nightmare scenario where he was in the Holland tunnel headed to New Jersey and realized he was supposed to take the test in Long Island. (Note: edited lightly for clarity):  "I took a company car with a fellow employee to New Jersey for level 1. He was taking the test at the Continental Arena. Midway through the Holland tunnel, I realized I was taking mine at the Nassau Coliseum. Cabbie dumped me off in Weehawken. Somehow, I called a cab service, he booked it to Long Island, and got me there just in time before doors closed. Heart attack city. I passed, I don't how, because I was shaking for the first hour of the test." Phew!  FREE AppDownload
