11:31 am EST - July 24, 2013 By Enis   The technicals paint an interesting picture at this juncture.  Here is the chart since January: It&#8217;s a bit crowded, but I want to make an important point about the repeated breakouts in TSLA ever since it broke its long-term resistance around $40 (which was the reasoning behind both of our trades in TSLA back in the spring).  I&#8217;ve circled in green on the lower volume panel each &#8220;kick-off&#8221; move in the stock since it began its stellar run.  I&#8217;ve included with a green line the prior high of TSLA stock before the breakout move indicated by the kick-off volume. The first 2 breakouts, in March (TSLA&#8217;s announcement that it would be profitable) and early May (earnings), never revisited the prior high (though TSLA almost touched $40 in April).  The breakout in late May above $100 was not as strong, as it did sell off back below the prior high (around $97) for a few days, though it eventually made a new high on July 1st.  After that last breakout above $115, TSLA had a nasty reversal day last week. Two things of note on the price action in the last month that might indicate a change of character: 1)  The volume on the July 1st breakout was the weakest of the kick-off moves. 2)  The volume on the July 16th reversal bar was the largest since May 14th.  May 14th was only a minor reversal day, and it was quickly bought, but May 14th&#8217;s reversal came after 3 huge accumulation days.  In addition, its reversal didn&#8217;t even breach the prior day&#8217;s low, so it did little technical damage.  In contrast, the July 16th reversal bar dwarfed the prior 6 weeks of action in volume terms, and it also made a new low for the stock for the month of July, taking out 2 weeks of positive price action in one day. In this context, the July 16th reversal bar has done major technical damage to the stair-stepping uptrend in TSLA over the past 6 months.  TSLA reports earnings on August 7th after the close.  The price action leading up to that event will give a better sense of whether sellers have indeed become more aggressive than buyers for the first time all year. 			  			Follow me on Twitter: @EnisTaner 			Email Me
