In fact, most of the US’ imported oil comes from countries in North and South America.US Energy Information Administration If we look up the top 10 exporters of oil to the US, we might be surprised to find that our friendly neighbors to the north are the ones working the hardest to keep our gasoline tanks full. (Or at least, 87% of us will be surprised by this!) You’re reading the chart right: The US imported 1.14 billion barrels of oil from Canada in 2013 alone.
