First SolarShares in First Solar were off 5.5% after hours Tuesday. The Tempe-based solar panel manufacturer and distributor reported revenues of $544 million versus $785.88 million forecast. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.04. Bloomberg said that figure may not be comparable with analysts' estimates. The firm now claims to have created the highest efficiency thin film photovoltaic cell on record, at 21%.  First Solar chalked up the revenue miss to delayed recognition of a project from last quarter, as well as project delays this quarter.
