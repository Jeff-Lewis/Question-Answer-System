Millennials, those born between 1982 and 2004, are set to shape the U.S. economy in a big way in coming years. While Millennials are less likely to form households in their 20s, as the economy recovers many will, inevitably move out of their homes and look to rent. RealtyTrac found the 50 best markets for renting residential properties to Millennials.  "Investors leveraging demographic trends will often be able to amplify rental returns and home price appreciation, particularly when it comes to trends in the baby boomer and millennial generations, which combined account for approximately 147 million people — more than 60 percent of the U.S. adult population," RealtyTrac's Daren Blomquist said in a press release. To qualify, these markets had  to have 10% in the millennial demographic between 2007 and 2013 and the Millennial population accounted for at least 24% of the total populations in 2013. Annual gross rental yields for the top 50 millennial rental markets ranged from 5.53% to 21.32%.
