  Flickr/arnold inuakiThe cuisine at Le BernardinThe two biggest names in restaurant rankings — Michelin and Zagat — are out with their top picks for New York City restaurants in 2014. Le Bernardin tops Zagat's "top food" list for the twelfth year in a row. Chef Eric Ripert's seafood mecca in Midtown Manhattan received a 29 out of 30 for food from Zagat's reviewers. It also received a coveted three-star ranking from Michelin. There was no change from 2013 among the three-starred restaurants from Michelin. In addition to Le Bernardin, they are Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, Daniel, Eleven Madison Park , Jean Georges, Masa, and Per Se. Michelin did add one restaurant to its two-star list: Jungsik, a Korean restaurant in TriBeCa, moved up from its one-star designation in 2013.  Here are the top restaurants in New York City for 2014, according to Zagat.
