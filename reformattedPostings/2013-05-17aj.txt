Robert Libetti/ Business InsiderA bit over a month ago we polled Business Insider's Wall Street readers to find out where bankers, traders, and the like really enjoy grabbing a meal. After letting the survey marinate for a bit, a winner began to emerge — Del Frisco's Restaurant. To be honest, we were a little shocked. Del Frisco's is a Texas-based a chain, and it's not the most expensive or flashy (Remember: this is Wall Street) restaurant in NYC. So why, in a town chock-full of the newest this and the most expensive that, was Del Frisco's selected? Business Insider decided to head over to the restaurant to find out why. The main reason is this — Del Frisco's is a service driven restaurant. Unlike a lot of NYC spots, the chef is not in charge, you are. Anything you want, just ask manager Scott Gould and he'll make sure you walk out happy. Of course, that means management makes a lot of tweaks to ensure that every diner's experience is completely enjoyable. We've narrowed in on some of the Wall Street specific measures, but we're fairly sure that these are things anyone can appreciate.
