Twitter.com/officialsigepFall fraternity rush is beginning at college campuses across the country. The reasons people join these groups might vary. Most people probably want to make more friends and have a full social calendar, while others might want to form connections with past and current brothers that could be useful in later life. We combed through a bunch of fraternities' notable members lists to find big Wall Street names, both past and present, who were brothers.   We have included a roundup of frats that have produced some of the biggest, and in a couple of cases some of the most infamous, names on the Street.  If you know of any names we are missing, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com. If anyone knows of sorority alums working in finance, feel free to send those names, too.  FREE AppDownload
