REUTERS/StringerDemand for new homes went bonkers in May. Sales surged 18.6% to an annualized rate of 504,000 units. Economists were forecasting a 439,000 pace. "This is a very welcome jump in sales - the biggest m/m increase in 22 years but the usual caveats apply," noted Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson. "These data are hyper-volatile, with a margin of error of +/-17.3%, and are subject to potentially large revisions." According to the report, the median sales price for homes sold during the month was $282,000. The average price was $319,200. "The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was 189,000," reported the Census Bureau. "This represents a supply of 4.5 months at the current sales rate." "While housing data largely disappointed in April relative to our expectations of a rebound following weather-related softness in Q1, the solid May prints in both new and existing home sales provide encouraging evidence that housing activity will end Q2 on a much stronger note," said Barclays' Cooper Howes.
