Wikimedia CommonsSbarro has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The embattled pizza chain is in the process of closing 155 restaurants in an attempt to become more profitable. Sbarro has $140 million in debt, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The closures were all company-owned stores in North America, not franchises, according to Bloomberg.  Sbarro has more than 800 stores total.  The pizza chain most commonly seen in mall food courts is still trying to recover from its 2011 bankruptcy. Slowing mall traffic has contributed to its decline.  FREE AppDownload
