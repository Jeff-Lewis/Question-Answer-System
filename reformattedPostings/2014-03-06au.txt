REUTERS/David McNew Satoshi Nakamoto and an AP reporter he chose to interview him are being chased in Nakamoto's Prius by all the other reporters apparently left behind, according to L.A. Times biz editor Joe Bel Bruno. The unnamed reporter and Nakamoto were driven to the AP's L.A. Bureau. Nakamoto is denying Newsweek's story. Newsweek is standing by it. Bel Bruno said he and a colleague were two cars behind. We've reached out to AP to ask who's with Satoshi. Earlier today, Leah McGrath Goodman reported she'd tracked down the Satoshi Nakamoto who wrote the first-ever Bitcoin spec paper. He is an engineer and former government contractor living near L.A.
