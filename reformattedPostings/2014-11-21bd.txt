Thomson ReutersTraders work in the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange(Reuters) - Mergers and acquisition deals announced so far this year have topped $3 trillion, the highest since 2007, helped by mega deals in the healthcare, energy and power sectors. The total value of deals globally jumped about 48 percent to $3.06 trillion as of Nov. 20, compared with the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Goldman Sachs Group Inc &lt;gs.n&gt; retained its No. 1 position as M&amp;A adviser with deals worth $877 billion, followed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;jpm.n&gt; with $651 billion and Citigroup Inc &lt;c.n&gt; with $633 billion. Morgan Stanley &lt;ms.n&gt; slipped to the fifth position from third last year. The M&amp;A market, which was the doldrums following the financial crisis, got a lift from a resurgent stock market and growing confidence among cash-rich companies. The $66.4 billion bid for Allergan Inc &lt;agn.n&gt; by Actavis PLC &lt;act.n&gt; this week more than doubled the total value of deals in the healthcare sector to $364 billion. Halliburton Co's &lt;hal.n&gt; plans to buy smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc &lt;bhi.n&gt; for about $38.5 billion raised the value of deals in the energy sector by 68 percent to $516.3 billion. Other notable deals include Comcast Corp's &lt;cmcsa.o&gt; $45.2 billion bid for rival Time Warner Cable Inc &lt;twc.n&gt;. The United States led the way with about $1.41 trillion worth of deals, up 58 percent compared with last year.   (Reporting by Avik Das in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) FREE AppDownload
