Previous drafts before weak euro zone economic data in the past few days made no mention of the economic situation. In contrast the latest document read: "In recent weeks economic data have confirmed that the recovery, particularly in the euro area, is weak, inflation exceptionally low and unemployment unacceptably high." As a result there would be a summit, hosted by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Oct. 7, that would focus on "employment, especially youth employment, investment and growth". A "dedicated Euro Summit" would also be held in the autumn.  (Reporting by Barbara Lewis; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; editing by Foo Yun Chee) FREE AppDownload
