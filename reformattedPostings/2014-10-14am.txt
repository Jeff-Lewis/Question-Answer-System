Screenshot/PocketnowGT Advanced Technologies' sapphire displays were expected to be on the iPhone 6 but ended up only being used for the Apple Watch. GT Advanced Technologies COO Daniel Squiller sold nearly $2 million in company stock before the firm filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week, according to The Wall Street Journal's Diasuke Wakabayashi. GTAT supplies Apple's sapphire display, which is expected to be used on the Apple Watch. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that GTAT's CEO sold a large amount of stock before Apple announced it would not be using sapphire on the iPhone 6 (except on the camera).  Squiller unloaded roughly $1.2 million in shares last May and has sold $750,000 in shares since then. These sales came after signs of production trouble, with Apple delaying payments starting in February, according to the WSJ. What few shares Squiller has held onto aren't worth much anymore. GTAT was trading around $0.41 per share on Tuesday. FREE AppDownload
