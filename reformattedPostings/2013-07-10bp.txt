The heavy weights of media and technology gather in Sun Valley, Idaho for Allen &amp; Co.'s summer camp for billionaires, millionaires, and those that aspire to be either.  Allen &amp; Co is a small investment bank that works on a lot of deals. It gathers people like Warren Buffett, Jerry Yang, Tim Cook, and others for a conference each summer in Idaho. At the conference, the media moguls either start on big deals, like when Comcast's Brian Roberts started talks about buying NBC, or they get closer to closing deals. Or, they just catch up with people in the industry and trade gossip.  FREE AppDownload
