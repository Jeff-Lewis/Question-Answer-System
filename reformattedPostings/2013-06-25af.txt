The downturn in the labor market shows up clearly in the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Time Use Survey. Americans worked three hours and eleven minutes per day on average in 2012, down 17 minutes from 2007 (although up slightly from post-recession lows). This number, which includes all Americans over the age of 15, is declining due to various factors, including a rise in unemployment and a big drop in labor force participation rate, as older workers retire and discouraged workers leave the job market for good. FRED Where does all of the time go?  The average American sleeps a whopping eight hours and 44 minutes a day, up ten minutes from 2007, and two hours and 50 minutes watching TV, up 13 minutes from 2007. Leisure hours, sleep, and time spent watching TV are all at their highest levels since the survey began in 2003.
