Two Metro-North trains collided Friday evening in Connecticut, leaving 60 people injured, five who are in serious condition, The New York Times reports.  An eastbound train traveling from Grand Central Terminal to New Haven derailed near Bridgeport, Conn. shortly after 6 p.m., striking a train heading in the opposite direction and causing the first car of that train to also run off the track. Metro-North has suspended service between South Norwalk and New Haven until further notice.  Two tracks where the incident occurred sustained "extensive infrastructure damage," and the overhead wire has also been damaged, the MTA wrote on their website.The train cars will need to be removed by crane, but not until the on-scene investigation is complete, the MTA said.   Meanwhile all Amtrak service between New York and Boston has been suspended.
