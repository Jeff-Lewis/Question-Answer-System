Flickr/byJoeLodgeApple is down a whopping 44% from it's all-time closing high, which was $702.10 on September 19, 2012. That's an enormous $291.42 billion worth of paper losses for Apple shareholders. "To put that number in perspective, the amount that Apple has lost from 09/19/12 through Friday’s close is more than the total value of the smallest 71 companies in the S&amp;P 500 index," said Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus. "Put another way, the value lost over this seven-month period exceeds Friday’s closing market capitalization of the third-largest S&amp;P index member, Google Inc., by more than $25 billion!" Those are big numbers. FREE AppDownload
