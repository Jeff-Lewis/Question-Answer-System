Everyone knows there are high markups in restaurants, bars, and most retail goods, but what about celebrity real estate? The folks at real estate website Movoto looked at a number of celebrity homes in the Los Angeles and Malibu areas to see if the prices of these homes were inflated compared to similar non-celebrity homes in the same area simply because a famous person used to live there. The answer, they found, is "yes" ... depending on the celebrity. Robert Pattinson's place in Los Feliz, for example, sold for 202% above the average home price in the neighborhood, but Katy Perry's Hollywood Hills home went for 27% below average.
