ReutersOver the weekend, the People's Bank of China widened its yuan-dollar trading band to 2%, from 1%. While this is an important step towards internationalizing its currency, Bank of America's David Cui points to the  market implications of the reform. "The knee-jerking market reaction may be to speculate on such a move given China's over-capacity issue (exports is a convenient way to address the problem)," writes Cui. "So in the short run, we expect the impact on the market to be largely negative." First let's take a look at the negative implications: This will however be positive for exporters as it would make their good cheaper and for Macau, "until the government cracks down on money laundering." Remember this is however in keeping with the promise made during the third plenum to let markets play a bigger role in resource allocation.  Summarizing from the Chinese central bank's statement, Standard Chartered's Stephen Green reiterated that this move would allow for greater "price discovery and more efficient resource allocation." He added that it would "deepen the breadth and depth of the onshore markets." Meanwhile, we've pointed out that the more meaningful reform that China needs to undertake involves relinquishing control of its exchange rate by moving away from a daily fix. FREE AppDownload
