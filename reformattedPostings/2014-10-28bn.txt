Following Tuesday's report, David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said, "The deceleration in home prices continues. The Sun Belt region reported its worst annual returns since 2012, led by weakness in all three California cities — Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. Despite weaker year-over-year numbers, home prices are still showing an overall increase, as the National Index increased for its eight consecutive month."  On Twitter following the report, Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, said that using what he calls a "better" seasonal adjustment, home prices did not decline in August.  Case-Shiller had m/m drops in natl seas adj index in Apr, May, &amp; June, but that's a SA issue.
