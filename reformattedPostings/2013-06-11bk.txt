Dislocated liquidity conditions -- as in wider and more volatile bid-offer spreads, considerably less intermediation appetite among dealers, etc. -- are cascading down from the most levered market segments. The direct and immediate causes are: In essence, the liquidity underpinnings of markets can no longer support the overall positioning of investors overly comforted by the prolonged and repeated interventions of hyper active central banks using experimental policies.  Determining whether this is just a temporary blip or what economists call a “multiple equilibrium” (i.e., rather than mean revert, an unpleasant outcome increases the probability of a subsequent worse outcome) is essentially a call on two main issues: the health of the underlying fundamentals relative to market pricing, and the availability of balance sheets to step in with stabilizing liquidity. Given current indicators, this periodic phase of dislocation in market liquidity -- and they do occur occasionally -- is likely to continue in the immediate period ahead.  In the process, look for some attractive pockets of value to emerge.
