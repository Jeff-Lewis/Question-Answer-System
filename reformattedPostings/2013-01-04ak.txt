APThe New York Fed’s primary dealers, the 21 banks with which it carries out transactions, expect quantitative easing to continue until 1Q 2014. This is according to a Dow Jones Business News report. The primary dealers’ median expectation is that the Fed will continue to purchase $45 billion worth of Treasuries each month throughout 2013, and cut that to $35 billion per month in early 2014. These findings come from a survey of primary dealers that was conducted before the December FOMC meeting.  The recently released minutes of the December FOMC meeting revealed that several Fed governors were taking a more hawkish stance in regards to the bond-buying program. The fact that the survey occured before the FOMC meeting is what makes the results surprising. It “hints at the fact that dealers were already expecting a slowdown in the Fed’s purchasing efforts around the end of 2013.” Thr FOMC minutes indicated that “a few members expressed the view that ongoing asset purchases would likely be warranted until about the end of 2013” while “Several others thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or stop purchases well before the end of 2013.” Markets appeared to be blindsided by this development and gains on the day were erased after that news from the Fed. Regardless, at least one economist thinks that we're making too much of all of this: Fears of early Fed QE phase-out are way exaggerated. Fed minutes noises are most likely another Fed fake... expect QE thru all of 2013 FREE AppDownload
