The Blaze via BuzzfeedGlenn BeckGlenn Beck says there's something unusual about the plunge in gold prices, according to Buzzfeed.  Beck first expresses skepticism toward the recent plunge in prices. "The only thing I have to fear is the government, quite frankly," he said. "The government lying to you, the media not telling the truth. I mean, gold is the original gold standard, and something doesn't smell right. Such a currency of last resort that it's so unstable that the central banks are buying it up." He continued: "Let's say this turns out to be a terrorist operation with multiple bombs around the city. The stock market tanking, things going awry — wouldn't this exactly be like how it would happen?" UPDATE: We earlier reported Beck was suggesting his viewers buy gold on the Boston bombings. A Blaze rep reached out to us noting he never explicitly made this connection.    FREE AppDownload
