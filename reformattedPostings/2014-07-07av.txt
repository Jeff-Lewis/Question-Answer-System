This chart, plotting the greatest investors of all time based on their returns compared to the S&amp;P 500 over time, is getting passed around all over the finance arena on Twitter. Investors listed range from people still in the game, like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, to legends who are no longer with us, like Walter Schloss and Benjamin Graham. U.K. publisher Harriman House made the chart. What instantly jumps out is that there are a lot of people who have beat the market big-time over the course of a few years. But, there aren't many people with a track record of beating the market over the course of decades. Both Soros and Buffett stand out as guys who crushed the market over many years.
