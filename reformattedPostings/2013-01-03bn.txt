It looks like trading firm Knight Capital will sell itself to Getco Holding company, sources tell Reuters. From Reuters: Though Virtu had offered an all-cash deal, Getco and its private equity firm General Atlantic increased its offer to above $3.60 a share in cash and stock in the combined company, one source said. Under Getco's plan, Knight Chief Executive Thomas Joyce would give up his role. Joyce leaving is a pretty big deal. He's respected on Wall Street, and saved the company after it suffered a $400 million loss due to a bug in one of its trading programs this summer. Then again, the loss was under his watch so it is what it is. FREE AppDownload
