Warren Buffett is the fourth richest man in the world, so you would think money would be his tip-top priority, but it's not. What he's really worried about, according to Morningstar (h/t Josh Brown) is a nuclear, biological or chemical attack on Washington D.C. or New York City. At least that's what he said in 2002. From Morningstar: "We're going to have something in the way of a major nuclear event in this country. It will happen. Whether it will happen in 10 years or 10 minutes, or 50 years ... it's virtually a certainty." Buffett's worried that the technology it takes to make these terrible fears a reality are becoming more accessible to those that wish to do the United States harm, and eventually our enemies are going to get their hands on these awful weapons. Can't say he sweats the small stuff.   FREE AppDownload
