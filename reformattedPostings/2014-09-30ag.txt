Cisco CEO John Chambers didn't get hit his sales and profit targets so the board trimmed his pay. Chambers earned about $16.5 million for fiscal 2014, compared to the $21 million he earned for fiscal 2013. The board dinged his stock awards to $12.9 million from $15.2 million last year. His bonus fell to $2.5 million from $4.7 million, according to documents filed with the SEC. The board trimmed the pay of other top execs, too. "Based on Cisco’s performance at 95% of target during fiscal 2014, the incentive cash awards paid for fiscal 2014 to the named executive officers were on average 40% less than fiscal 2013," the company said in its documents. Cisco had $47.1 billion in sales in fiscal 2014, missing the company’s target of $49.5 billion. Its operating income was $13.4 billion, not the $14 billion target, reports Bloomberg's Peter Burrows. Although Cisco slashed Chambers' pay compared to last year, he's still up from his paycheck two years ago, when Cisco paid him $11.6 million. FREE AppDownload
