The misery index, a crude economic measure created by Arthur Orkum, sums a country's unemployment and inflation rates to assess conditions on the ground (the higher the number, the more miserable a country is).  The reasoning: Most citizens understand the pain of a high jobless rate and the soaring price of goods. Business Insider totaled the figures for 197 countries and territories — from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe — to compile the 2013 Misery Index. Note: Results are based on CIA World Factbook data, which estimates figures for countries and territories that do not have reliable local reporting agencies.
