The Canadian planemaker is interested in showing the aircraft to a number of U.S. mainline carriers, including United Airlines Continental Holdings Inc , said spokeswoman Marianella Delabarrera. She declined to say who has seen it so far. "We're trying to capture as much of the interest as possible," said Delabarrera of the ongoing demo tour. "We really don't want to disrupt the flight testing if we can prevent that, but there are times when it's convenient." The closely watched CSeries is being tested at Bombardier's facilities in Mirabel, Quebec, and Wichita, Kansas. In an ambitious push into the competitive commercial jet market, the CSeries aircraft will compete with smaller offerings from Boeing Co  and Airbus Group NV  as well as Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA . Testing was halted in May after an on-ground engine fire, but resumed in September. The program has been plagued by delays and rising costs, worrying investors. One of the CSeries test planes went to Bombardier's regional sales office in Dallas in October. It also visited Republic Airways Inc , a unit of American Airlines Group Inc  that has a firm order for the CSeries, in Indianapolis. Delabarrera said some customers went to Dallas to see the plane, and others have visited Mirabel.  (Reporting by Allison Martell; Editing by Jeffreys Hodgson and Benkoe) FREE AppDownload
