Getty Images/ Alan Crowhurst Looking ahead to what the future for the global economy.Three prominent Wall Street strategists recently shared their outlooks for global financial markets with Canadian investment professionals gathered in Toronto for the CFA Society Toronto’s 57th Annual Forecast Dinner. Charles Brandes, CFA, founder and chairman of Brandes Investment Partners; Russ Koesterich, CFA, chief investment strategist at BlackRock; and Christian Stracke, global head of credit research at PIMCO, spoke with guarded optimism, and their predictions included calls for slow growth, increased volatility, and a comeback for active management. Their presentations are summarized below. Brandes is the author of "Value Investing Today" and is a value investor in the mold of Benjamin Graham, so it was fitting that he began by quoting Graham: “Everybody in Wall St. is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other. And that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of stock prices, pretty much, and consequently, what happens in the future represents what they don’t know.” Brandes closed with more wisdom from Graham: “What happens in the future we don’t know. If you base your decisions on value, you will.” Koesterich is author of "The ETF Strategist" and "The Ten Trillion Dollar Gamble". Stracke opened by noting, with tongue in cheek, that “things are pretty boring in Newport Beach right now,” a not so subtle reference to the recent departure of PIMCO co-founder Bill Gross, CFA. Stracke also cautioned about the deteriorating quality of debt issuances, including covenant-lite loans. FREE AppDownload
