The south wing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City was evacuated this morning after a possible gas leak, CBS Local reports. The wing was ventilated to help remove a strong smell of gas, according to ABC7. Passengers were allowed back into the building just after 9am, MyFoxNY reports. Buses to the terminal had been dropping passengers off on 10th Avenue and other nearby areas, but a tweet from a NJ Transit Twitter account suggests buses are returning to their normal routes. The inbound Lincoln Tunnel has been experiencing a delay of around 30 minutes due to the incident. FREE AppDownload
