In case you hadn't noticed, yesterday marked the fifth consecutive trading day that the Dow moved 100+ points.  We've seen three 100-point down days and two 100-point up days in the last five days of trading. And the Dow's up over 100 points today. That's a lot of volatility, but the record is 10 trading days back in October 2008. Something to aspire to! Below is the chart from Bespoke Investment: Bespoke Investment FREE AppDownload
