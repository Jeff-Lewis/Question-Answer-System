Meanwhile, the stock market is at an all-time high. And the investment community is still digesting Warren Buffett's hot-off-the-press annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Overseas, tensions are flaring up in Ukraine. And on top of all of this, every major economy will be publishing their manufacturing purchasing managers' index reports, which will give us an up-to-date read on the health of the global economy. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Warren Buffett's 2013 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders was published this Saturday. With the stock market at all-time highs, some wisdom from the oracle of Omaha seems timely. From Buffett: "The main danger is that the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs’ observation: “A bull market is like sex. It feels best just before it ends.”) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a long period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the “know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long- term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness."
