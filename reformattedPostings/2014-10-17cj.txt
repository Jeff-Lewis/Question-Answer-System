Bond markets are heading for a "perfect storm," according to Andrew Bosomworth, head of Pimco's German portfolio management.

The cost of servicing Greece's government debt is now at its highest level in 2014 so far, pretty much killing the government's plan to leave its bailout early. And according to a note from Pantheon Macroeconomics on Friday morning, though bond yields are still low in comparison with their euro-crisis highs, we are seeing "clear and acute signs of stress" in Portugal, Spain, and Italy.
