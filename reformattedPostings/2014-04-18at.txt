Two years ago, we wrote about how the Los Angeles police had begun looking for ways to crack down on personal drone use — especially the use of drones by real-estate agents. It seems that the realtors have won. Jim Klinge, aka Jim the Realtor, who does great blogging about the never-dull Southern California housing market at BubbleInfo.com, has been showing off his new Phantom drone with a Go-Pro in his latest videos. Here's what he said about why a drone is useful:  Photos in front of a view [sic] home where you can get a sense of how big the view is, could be one application. Videos of areas of general interest is another. I’ve already seen realtors use them and they photograph the roof of the house and use it for their lead photo. Not sure what that does – I know you have a roof. If I get good at it, there’s a chance of doing the interior of a house. Here are some stills taken by the drone:   Jim KlingeA lagoon outside a two-bedroom, two-bathroom house going for $1.5 million in Carlsbad.  Jim KlingeThis morning, he put up an aerial tour of the area surrounding a subdivision in Carlsbad, where homes are going for as much as $700,000. The thing is 770 feet in the air. Jim Klinge This explains why Google's decision to purchase a drone manufacturer makes a lot of sense, and why drones are going to make someone a billionaire. These things are going nowhere.
