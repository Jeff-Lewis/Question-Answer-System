Business InsiderAmazon announced its first smartphone Wednesday, the Fire Phone. The Fire Phone goes on sale July 25, but you can only get it if you're an AT&amp;T customer. It costs $199.99 with a two-year contract. You can also buy it without a contract starting at $649. It has a 4.7-inch screen, which is slightly larger than the 4-inch screen on the iPhone 5S. One of the biggest features in the phone is Firefly. Firefly lets you snap photos of real-world objects and then search for them for purchase on Amazon. In short, the Fire Phone is a device that'll make it easier to buy stuff from Amazon. The phone also has 3-D effects called Dynamic Perspective on the screen that can be used for gaming, mapping, and even shopping apps. (Amazon showed a demo where the Fire Phone let you "peek" around a dress on a shopping site.)
