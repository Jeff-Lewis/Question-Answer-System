Bill Weir of CNN just tweeted this extraordinary photograph of Len Dawson, the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, during halftime of Super Bowl 1 in 1967 (See the original photo here). A few things to notice: First, Dawson looks like a skinny little shrimp compared to today's players. Look at those legs. They look like toothpicks. Second, he appears to be drinking a Fresca. A Fresca! Third, he's smoking a cigarette.  Len Dawson enjoys a halftime smoke during Superbowl 1. http://t.co/s2G7hHVRas pic.twitter.com/1ZdOrHkSwL FREE AppDownload
