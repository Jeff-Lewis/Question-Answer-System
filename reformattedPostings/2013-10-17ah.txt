IncrementumRonald Stöferle runs commodity funds that mainly invest in physical gold and silver as a partner at new firm Incrementum AG. Stöferle put together a presentation that includes 50 charts making the bull case for gold, which has lost 30% of its value since peaking at $1900 an ounce in 2011. The first series of charts in the slide deck make the case for gold based on a variety of valuation and other metrics. These are followed by a series of charts on debt, the economy, and the actions of central banks around the world.
