The American Federation of Teachers, a labor union that represents teachers, sent out a "watch list" for hedge funds who might have an opposing stance on their defined benefit plans (DB plans).  The report has a list of hedge funds and hedge fund managers AFT believes are attacking pension plans. "This is about transparency- a right to know," AFT President Randi Weingarten said about the report. "America’s workers and pension trustees deserve to know if the asset managers they are investing their hard-earned retirement savings with are also aligned with organizations advocating for the elimination of those same pension plans.
