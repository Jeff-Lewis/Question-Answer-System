REUTERS/ Lucas Jackson Is Preet Bharara of the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York taunting Wall Street? On Monday, the office's official Twitter account posted the following message, claiming a "significant financial institution" is about to be in serious legal trouble: You can expect that before long a significant financial institution will be charged with a felony or be made to plead guilty to a felony "In my view, after Arthur Andersen, the pendulum has swung too far and needs to swing back a bit. And so you can expect that before too long a significant financial institution will be charged with a felony or be made to plead guilty to a felony, where the conduct warrants it," Bharara said. However, in the tweet from his office, the full context was not entirely clear and the tweet was not presented as a quote.  The office followed that tweet up with a pair of updates about a fraud case against a "broker &amp; distributor of dairy products." There was no further information about any impending felony charges. Bharara's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider Monday evening.   Updated 8:41 PM with details from Bharara's speech. FREE AppDownload
