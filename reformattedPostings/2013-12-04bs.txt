REUTERS/Carlo AllegriEclectica Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer and Founding Partner Hugh HendryU.K.-based hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, the founder of Eclectica Asset Management, made some interesting comments about how he thinks Bitcoin could go to $1 million, Investment Week's Dan Jones reports. "This is the environment where Bitcoin could go to $1m. There is no qualitative reason, but it is trending. If I could own Bitcoin, I would," Hendry said, according to Investment Week. The reason Hendry doesn't own Bitcoin is because it's not available on a regular exchange, the report said.  The digital, decentralized currency that first emerged in 2009 is now trading above $1,100.   FREE AppDownload
