REUTERSThis is what trading looked like in Hong Kong in 2000.Economists and traders are still trying to unpack what happened with Friday's disappointing December jobs report. PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian described it as "somewhere between puzzling and worrisome." The shortfall in payrolls has largely been attributable to cold weather. Indeed, construction jobs saw payrolls drop by 16,000 during the period.

This week offers a ton of economic data that may confirm or deny the lousy jobs report. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary It's Q4 earnings season. "The estimated earnings growth rate for Q4 2013 is 6.1%," said FactSet's John Butters. "The Financials sector is projected to have the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the Energy sector is projected to have the lowest earnings growth rate for the quarter." Butters says that the big themes to watch are the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange movements, the status of Europe's stabling but weak economy, and the growth contribution from the emerging markets, which are showing signs of slowing. "For Q1 2014, analysts are expecting earnings growth of 4.3%," said Butters regarding guidance. "However, earnings growth is projected to improve in each subsequent quarter for the remainder of the year. For Q2 2014, Q3 2014, and Q4 2014, analysts are predicting earnings growth rates of 9.2%, 12.8%, and 13.7%. For all of 2014, the projected earnings growth rate is 10.5%." FREE AppDownload
