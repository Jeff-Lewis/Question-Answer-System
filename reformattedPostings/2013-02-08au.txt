A young Wall Street analyst wrote this to The New York Times: I am a 22-year-old man working at a new job on Wall Street. My boss is a very attractive 30-year-old woman. We happen to exercise at the same gym at the same time. We both swim, and the first time we ran into each other, she was wearing a one-piece bathing suit, and I was wearing a classic Speedo. I saw her look me up and down. The next week, she started wearing a thong bikini. Isn’t this a power thing? Jim, Fort Lee, N.J. Thoughts?  [Via Dealbreaker's Bess Levin] FREE AppDownload
