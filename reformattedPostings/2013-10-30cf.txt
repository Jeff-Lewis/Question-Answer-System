Flickr via keoni101World markets continue to feel like they're on autopilot and that nothing can go wrong. Gains are being seen everywhere today. Asian equities had a big session, with Japan gaining 1.2% and China rising 1.48%. European markets are higher. Germany is up 0.5% and Italy is up 0.3%. And US futures are modestly higher. Later in the day today we get the ADP Jobs report (8:15 ET), which will give us a look at private payroll growth for October. There's no Non-Farm Payrolls report this week due to shutdown-related scheduling changes. So we'll get that a week from Friday. This afternoon we get the latest decision from the FOMC. The expectation is that they will change nothing. FREE AppDownload
