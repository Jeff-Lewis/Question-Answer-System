Oil prices are down this morning.  The Brent was under $70 a barrel overnight, and it is currently trading at $69.17 (-0.68%). Earlier this morning, it was at $69.08.  Crude is currently trading at $66.25 (-0.84%):  Both indexes hit record lows earlier this week, with Brent oil hitting $67.72 a barrel on December. Crude oil was traded at $64.31 on the same day. Tony Nuan, a risk manager at Mitsubishi, told Reuters that on the current path, oil could go as low as $60 a barrel. "There is nothing to stop it," he said. Weaker oil prices could trigger a chain reaction that would further slow down the global economy.
