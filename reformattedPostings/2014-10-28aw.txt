U.S. News &amp; World Report released their inaugural "Best Global Universities Ranking" on Tuesday, naming Harvard University the best school in the world. U.S. News is known for their national universities and liberal arts college rankings, which this year named Princeton University and Williams College as the top schools in America. Harvard ranked second on the national universities list. As The Washington Post points out, it's a little odd for U.S. News to have Princeton at the top of their national universities list, but only ranked 13 for global universities. For their new ranking, U.S. News emphasized research prowess and global reputation, while omitting factors such as undergraduate admissions data and graduation rates that play a part in determining their national lists. "This is about faculty productivity and prestige ... It is meaningful for certain things and not necessarily meaningful for other things. We get that. This is about big muscular research universities doing what research universities claim is their mission," U.S. News Editor Brian Kelly told The Washington Post. Here are the top 2o universities in the world, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report: 1. Harvard University 2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology 3. University of California, Berkeley 4. Stanford University 5. University of Oxford (United Kingdom) 6. University of Cambridge (United Kingdom) 7. California Institute of Technology 8.
