Getty ImagesGood morning! European markets are up early Monday. Here's the scorecard: France's CAC 40 is up 0.64%. Spain's IBEX is up 1.05%. Italy's FTSE MIB is up 0.49%. Britain's FTSE 100 is up 0.40%. German markets are leading the climb, up 1.23% despite the bad news on the country's manufacturing sector Monday morning.  Asian markets saw a solid performance, too: the Hang Seng closed up 1.19% in Hong Kong, despite the ongoing protests there, and the Nikkei closed up 1.16% from Friday's close. U.S. futures are rising, with Dow futures and S&amp;P futures up 0.34% and 0.432%, respectively. It's a quiet day as far as economic releases are concerned, kicking off a quiet week. But with extremely poor German factory orders seen Monday, industrial production figures for the country Tuesday will be watched a little more closely for any big signs of weakness.
