PIMCO has a new video of bond king Bill Gross discussing volatility in the bond markets. Unfortunately, we were too distracted by a detail in the video to listen to the whole commentary. To the right of Gross' left shoulder is a bottle of Sriracha, the fiery Thai chili sauce that is slowly emerging from the American underground to the mainstream. Say what you want about Gross, PIMCO, and their outlook for interest rates. But I think we can all agree that the folks at PIMCO obviously have great taste.
