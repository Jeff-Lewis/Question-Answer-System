Mark Ralston/AFPChinese officials conducted "unannounced inspections" at two Bloomberg News bureaus at the end of November, Fortune's Peter Elkind and Scott Cendrowski report. The inspections at the Beijing and Shanghai bureaus came after Bloomberg decided to spike a year-long investigate story on alleged government corruption. That decision, which Bloomberg News editor-in-chief Matt Winkler reportedly likened to media organizations attempting to preserve their ability to report inside Nazi Germany, was at best criticized as an attempt to stay in the good graces of Chinese leadership.

Fortune says the details of the inspections are "sketchy."
