It beat Wall Street analysts' revenue and profit expectations. Revenue growth continued to accelerate –  grew 40% y/y, up from 32.80% y/y growth last quarter.  Operating margins improved, as well. Despite the good news, the stock dropped 10% as soon as the numbers came out.  Since then, it's climbed back some. At 5PM eastern, Facebook hosted an earnings call to discuss the numbers. We took notes below. THE NUMBERS: **EPS: $0.17 versus $0.15 consensus **Revenues: $1.59 billion versus $1.53 billion consensus **618 million daily active users. **Mobile daily active users exceeded desktop daily active users for the first time last quarter. SEE ALL THE NUMBERS AND CHARTS HERE &gt;&gt; He says there is a big opportunity to make ads better through 1)&nbsp;targeting and relevance 2)&nbsp;better ad products that aren't just about links and images. He says Facebook ads will have more kinds of media. Sounds like video. He says Gifts and Graph Search won't impact revenues for the next year. 23% of ad revenue came from mobile, up from 14% in Q3. Focus in Q4 was to scale products launched in 2012.  Proving that value. Taking advantage of mobile. Zuckerberg talks about ad quality. He says Facebook improved its News Feed algorithm and that likes and comments increased by 50%. Meanwhile, ads brought likes and comments down by 2%. So net, engagement is up, even w/ ads. Zuckerberg says we're early in social ads. We expected to not be able to show everyone an ad every day. We've been surprised that the quality has been naturally high and that there has been no engagement hit (that's meaningful). Previously thought we would have to tune quality level. Didn't have to. Now we can work on targeting.&nbsp; Zuckerberg answer on video ads. As soon as News Feed is richer with videos from users, then it will be "richer" with video ads. Facebook doesn't have to host the video, it can be a distribution platform.&nbsp; Conversion measurements only launched in mid-December. Could do a lot more, she says. She says it'll be exciting to do it on mobile. We can now measure all the way from seeing an ad on a mobile device to purchasing the product in a store.&nbsp; Sandberg talks about the opportunities.

Zuckerberg says there are three mobile platforms worth talking about.&nbsp; Mobile web, where you can't go very deep, but Facebook goes as deep as anybody. Android, is an open and dynamic platform. Even though our relationship with Google isn't one where the companies talk, we are able to do some cool experiences. For example, we can do an SMS app on Android. On iOS, the way you can do deeper integrations is working with Apple. They've been a great partner. You can share photos and share web pages. There's no meaningful numbers. It's a good experience.
