After a miserable summer, crude prices have come surging back as the ISIS militant group continues to make gains in the Middle East. London-traded Brent was trading around $103 Tuesday, near a two-week high and up 2% from recent lows. Until this week prices had come down as much as 12% from a June high.  Barclays has noted that those declines were masking run-ups at the long-end of the Brent contract's futures curve.
