You may remember "The Rich Kids of Instagram," a Tumblr started last year that documented the escapades of obnoxiously rich teens and young adults who posted snapshots to the photo-sharing service.  Now, some of those "kids" are getting their own TV show on E!. And now thanks to The New York Post's Page Six, we finally know who the mega-wealthy 20-somethings will be: E.J. Johnson, Dorothy Wang, Morgan Stewart, Brendan Fitzpatrick, Roxy Sowlaty, and Jonny Drubel. Since we couldn't wait for the 2014 premiere date, we dug into their Instagram accounts. Here's a sneak peek of what to expect. (Follow Dorothy here) (Follow Roxy here) (Follow Jonny here)  (Follow Morgan here) (Follow Brendan here)  TV insiders told The Post that the new show is set up to be a successor to E!'s "Keeping up with the Kardashians" as a "sexier" show. It will premiere in January 2014. And if you really, really can't wait, don't worry: You can currently pre-order "Rich Kids of Instagram: A Novel" on Amazon. FREE AppDownload
