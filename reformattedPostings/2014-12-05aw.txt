Oil is making a comeback. On Friday morning, after the US jobs report came in way better than expected, the price of oil tumbled again, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures falling more than 2% to less than $65.50 a barrel. This was the lowest level since crude prices dropped sharply late Sunday night after the futures market opened. But in afternoon trade, WTI was making a comeback, regaining more than $1 per barrel to trade north of $66.30 on Friday afternoon. The drop in oil came after Friday's jobs report, which sparked a rally in the US dollar, and after bouncing around, also saw the major stock indexes trade higher.  In afternoon trade the Dow was up 82 points, the S&amp;P 500 was up 6 points, and the Nasdaq was up 14 points. Near 1:15 pm ET, the Dow was just 18 points away from topping 18,000 for the first time. Here's Friday's big bounce in oil. FinViz      FREE AppDownload
