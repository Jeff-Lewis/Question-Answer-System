ReutersThe modern gentleman doesn't just know where to go and how to dress — he knows how to think. The only way to do that, to learn how to make sense of the world with your mind, is to consider a lot of different thoughts. By and large, the best of those thoughts can be found in books that have stood the test of time. We have compiled a list of classics that can teach you how to think — about politics, love, philosophy, bravery — everything a man should know to face the world. All these books were written before 1980. You'll have to wait for another list for more recent reads. In the meantime, check these out. FREE AppDownload
