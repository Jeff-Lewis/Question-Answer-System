REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonMarkets are pretty much lower everywhere this morning. Japan fell. Europe is down. And US futures are off a bit. There are three big events happening today: First is the ECB meeting, where there's growing thinking that there might be a rate cut. You can see a full preview of that here. Then at 8:30 AM, there's going to be the first reading of Q3 GDP. Analysts expect growth of 2.0%. And then at some point today, Twitter will hit the public market, and that will be a major event that everyone will be watching. Very exciting! FREE AppDownload
