Wikimedia CommonsGrand Central Terminal is one of New York City's most iconic landmarks, and today it turns 100 years old. The incredible feat of engineering originally debuted to the public as Grand Central Depot in October 1871, home to a massive steel and glass train shed that housed steam-driven trains.  But after a fatal accident between two steam locomotives in 1902, the transportation hub was converted to a safer electric rail system. Grand Central Station was demolished, and Grand Central Terminal was raised in its place, opening to the public on February 1, 1913.  To celebrate its 100th birthday, here's a look back at the birth, past, and present of one of the world's greatest train stations.
