The European Commission, which raided the companies in October 2008, said the cartel took place between 2003 and 2005. German chipmaker Infineon received the biggest penalty at 82.8 million euros. Samsung was fined 35.12 million euros and Philips 20.15 million euros. Philips denied fixing chip prices and said it would challenge the decision in court. Renesas Technology, a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric that was acquired by Renesas Electronics Corp in 2010, escaped a fine of more than 51 million euros as it was the first to alert the cartel to the EU competition authority. The chips produced by the companies are also used in bank cards, identity cards, passports and pay TV cards. The companies had sought to settle the case in return for a 10 percent cut in the fines but talks broke down last year.
