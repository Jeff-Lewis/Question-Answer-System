The U.S. energy revolution story continues to impress with every new stat that comes out. According to new data out of the Energy Information Association, U.S. crude oil production topped 7 million barrels per day during the November and December 2012 period. This is the highest level since December 1992. From the EIA: Increasing oil production in North Dakota and onshore Texas drove the increase in U.S. crude oil production over the last several months (although crude oil production in North Dakota took a dip in November, before increasing again in December). Much of the increase in crude oil production is coming from shale and other tight (very low permeability) formations. Initial estimates for production in November were below 7 million bbl/d, but revisions based on additional data indicate that production exceeded 7 million bbl/d in November 2012. That was followed by December production estimated to be more than 7 million bbl/d. Here's a historical look: EIA FREE AppDownload
