Twitter.comIt's finally happened: Twitter has become a serious tool in the world of finance and financial news. This spring, even Bloomberg embraced select accounts on its terminals, signaling that its high-speed, super short communication wasn't just for media types, comedians, and Kim Kardashian. Folks have been using Twitter to talk about finance for a long time, of course, but what's changed since the last time we did this is there's been a surge of no-nonsense industry practitioners using the service. Business Insider has compiled a list of the best of financial Tweeters for you to use. These are people we follow all day, and if you're going to get serious about using this awesome tool, you should follow them too. Some of them you'll definitely recognize from financial media, other are completely anonymous (as you can see by their avatars). FREE AppDownload
