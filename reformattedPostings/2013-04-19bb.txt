CNNA Toronto woman who identified herself as the Boston Marathon bombings suspects' aunt suggested to reporters Friday afternoon that her nephews had been set up.  "All these pictures are on the computer," Maret Tsarnaeva told reporters in a press conference that was aired by CNN. "I have to see them. You have to have a motive first — something that would drive you to some actions. They cannot go crazy or mad or sick just for one day. As far as I know, they are fine." "I don't trust the FBI," she added. "Show me evidence." She was asked who she thinks set them up.  "Whoever needs this," she said, shrugging. "Whoever is looking for those who need to be blamed for these attacks." That was a different take from the one expressed by an uncle of the suspects who spoke with reporters in an angry press conference earlier Friday. Ruslan Tsarni called both of the suspects "losers," and he urged Dzhokar to turn himself in.  "What I think was behind it: Being losers," he said.
