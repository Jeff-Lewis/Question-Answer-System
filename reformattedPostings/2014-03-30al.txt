Green energy has been around for quite awhile. From GE: "In 1887, Charles F. Brush built the first power generating wind turbine in Cleveland, Ohio. It was a 4-ton, 60-foot monster with 144 blades and a long, comet-like tail. It generated just 12 kilowatts of electricity – enough supply no more than three modern American homes. Brush later merged his electric company with Thomas Edison’s GE." @GeneralElectric FREE AppDownload
