Business InsiderIf you want to trade the markets you have to live the markets — that means turning your trading desk into your second home. That's why we put out a call to our readers to send in pictures of their oh-so-important spaces, and the response was just awesome. The desks came in from Croatia to Chicago, Brazil to Switzerland. You sent us everything from massive desks with a bunch of screens to killer views that likely make the day go by a lot faster. Thanks. Keep 'em coming. If you would like to include your trading desk set up, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com and llopez@businessinsider.com with a photo and a brief description.  FREE AppDownload
