Milken The Milken Institute is out with a great new report on the top cities for job growth across the country. The organization uses a number of criteria to rank both large and small cities, including job growth, wage growth and high-tech industry growth. Job growth takes into account employment gains during 2013 as well as those made during the previous five years to give a more comprehensive picture of each city's economic status instead of a yearly snapshot. Topping the list for the second year in a row for large cities was Austin, Texas as its technology sector has flourished in recent years. Coming in second was the Provo, Utah metro area with San Francisco finishing third. Columbia, Mo. was the top city for economic growth amongst small cities in 2013, rising nine spots from 2012. Columbus, Ind. was the runner-up.
