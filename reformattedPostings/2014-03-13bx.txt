Joshua Lott/Getty ImagesFebruary U.S. retail sales data are out. Total sales rose 0.3% from the previous month in February, above expectations for a 0.2% advance. January retail sales growth was revised down to -0.6% from -0.4%. Excluding autos, sales were up 0.3%, above expectations for a 0.1% gain. January ex-autos sales growth was revised down to -0.3% from 0%. Excluding both autos and gasoline, sales were up 0.3%, above expectations for a 0.2% rise. January ex-autos and gas sales growth was revised down to -0.5% from -0.2%. The retail sales control group, a figure that feeds into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.3%, above expectations for a 0.2% gain.
