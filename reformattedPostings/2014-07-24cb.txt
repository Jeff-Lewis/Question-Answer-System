"Ricardo Salgado was brought to the court by representatives of the prosecutor's office and will appear before a judge later today," the duty official at the Central Criminal Custody Court told Reuters, without elaborating. Local media said Salgado had been detained in connection with long-running investigation into money-laundering in the so-called Monte Branco case, in which he had been a voluntary witness previously. The prosecutor's office had no immediate comment, representatives of the Espirito Santo family could not be reached for comment.   (Reporting By Andrei Khalip; Editing by Laura Noonan) FREE AppDownload
