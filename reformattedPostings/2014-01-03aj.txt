A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that U.S. cities are becoming increasingly segregated by income. A more nuanced picture of this trend can be gathered from a new interactive website from the U.S. Census Bureau that shows median household income, age, education, and other statistics by census tract.  Lower-income households tend to be concentrated closer to the center of the cities, while higher-income households usually make up the outer-ring census tracts surrounding the cities. Pew developed what's called a Residential Income Segregation Index score to determine which cities have the greatest income segregation, with higher RISI scores showing higher income segregation. Below, we have featured maps of ten highly segregated U.S. metropolitan areas, in order of increasing income segregation. The three worst are all located in Texas.
