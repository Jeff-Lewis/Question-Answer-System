Business Insider/Matthew Boesler (data from St. Louis Fed) January core PCE deflator data are out. The deflator rose 0.1% from the previous month in January, bringing the year-over-year change in the core PCE deflator to 1.1% from December's 1.2% reading, as expected. The core PCE deflator is the measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve cites in its communications, and is thus closely followed by Fed watchers. "Core PCE monthly changes have been 0.1% every month from July to January," says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "June was the last month we had a 0.2% rise. If we don’t get more 0.2% monthly changes, the year-on-year figure will sink closer to zero-dot-zero. Fall to nothing, bordering on deflation. Core CPI inflation is higher, less worrisome to the deflation scare story, at 1.6% year-on-year in January. The difference is different accounting for medical care services prices, so there is no too-low inflation problem if you look at CPI, like most of the world does." FREE AppDownload
