The final tallies are in, and at this point, the winners and losers of 2013 probably won't surprise you. The Nikkei 225 and the S&amp;P 500 stock indices top the list of best-performing major asset classes of 2013, while gold and U.S. Treasuries are the worst among the losers. The dollar-yen exchange rate and the Euro Stoxx 50 index both had a spectacular year as well, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the euro, and the British pound sterling all eked out gains against the dollar, and emerging-market assets (proxied by MSCI's EM stock index, JPMorgan's Emerging Market Bond Index, and the Shanghai Composite) all ended the year lower than where they started.
