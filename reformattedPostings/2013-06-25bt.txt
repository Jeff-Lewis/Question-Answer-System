The increase in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield has been surpassed by the 10-year TIPS yield, which is up 126bps from minus 0.62% on May 2 to 0.64% yesterday. This yield has been abnormally low (i.e., negative) since the fall of 2011. It seems to be in the process of normalizing back into a range of 1%-2%.   Investors buy TIPS as a hedge against inflation. They buy gold for the same reason. So it isn’t surprising to see that the price of gold is highly correlated with the inverse of the TIPS yield. Nevertheless, this year’s free-fall in the price of gold is astonishing. It is also astonishing how well it predicted the jump in the TIPS yield.
