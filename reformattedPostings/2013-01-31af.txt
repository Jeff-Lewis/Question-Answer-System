Getty Images/Spencer PlattNew York City Council Speaker Christine QuinnJonathan Van Meter has written a big cover story on New York City mayoral hopeful Christine Quinn for New York Magazine. In it, he shares a anecdote about Quinn, Bloomberg, and... women's fashion? Dhani Mau at Fashionista calls it "oddly catty" and "frenemy-sounding."  We're inclined to agree. Then she said, “The mayor is going to yell at me when I get out of the car because I have flat boots on. The mayor has no use for flat shoes.” Really, I said. Why would he care? “I was at a parade with him once and he said, ‘What are those?’ and I said, ‘They’re comfortable,’ and he said, ‘I never want to hear those words out of your mouth again.’<U+2009>”Everyone in the vehicle, including the security detail in the front seat, cracked up. “He likes me in high heels. Let’s see how long it takes before he notices.” She scrolled through her BlackBerry. “Another big thing with the mayor, when I am rooting … like, the couple of days a week before I need to get my hair colored, he’ll say, ‘Do you pay a lot to make your hair be two colors? Because now it’s three with the gray.’ And I’m like, ‘Did you wake up being this big of an asshole? Or did it take, like, all day to ramp up to it to be able to insult me like that?’<U+2009>” Quinn insisted that the pair have a good working relationship despite all that. Bloomberg has often supported the New York fashion scene and he views events like Fashion Week as big wins for his city. FREE AppDownload
