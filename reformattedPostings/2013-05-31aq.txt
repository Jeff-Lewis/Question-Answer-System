Sam Ro / Business InsiderNOTE: We've featured this post before previous CFA exams.  The feedback has been positive, so we're running it again for you June 1 test takers.----------------- I'm not going to give you any tips on how to memorize formulas.  I'm not going to tell you how you what to eat during your lunch break. I just have one word for you: coffee. Maybe Red Bull or some other energy drink is your preferred source of caffeine.  But whatever it is, drink it up! Test-takers are often told that they have an average of 90 seconds to spend on each question (120 questions for each 3-hour section).  At least that's what they told me when I took the cram courses. As such, bathroom breaks are often considered wastes of time. But that's a fatal error. Drink coffee, Red Bull, or whatever, and give yourself 5 minutes for a bathroom break for each section. It's better to be efficient for 5 hours and 50 minutes, then to be inefficient for 6 hours. Sincerely, Someone who sat through and passed all three exams PS: And don't wear a diaper.  Every CFA test-taker has heard someone joke about this, and some claim they know someone who's done it.  But that's ridiculous.
