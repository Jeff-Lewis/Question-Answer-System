BoeingThe FAA has approved flight testing for Boeing's Dreamliner jet, it announced this afternoon. In a press release, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta laid out restrictions for the flights, including extensive pre-flight testing and inspections, and in-flight monitoring. The flights will be over unpopulated areas, in defined airspace. The 50 Dreamliner jets Boeing has delivered were grounded after the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner on January 16. The directive, the first of its kind in decades, was prompted by a battery malfunction that forced an All Nippon Airways flight to make an emergency landing. An ongoing review by the National Transportation Safety Board is examining the jet's lithium-ion battery, believed to be the source of a fire in a parked Dreamliner in Boston on January 7. The FAA will allow now Dreamliner test flights under a Special Airworthiness Certificate, with these requirements: Boeing was allowed to conduct a 787 "ferry flight" this morning, to move a plane from Texas to Washington. That flight was not for testing purposes, but Boeing said via Twitter it monitored battery status throughout the flight. FREE AppDownload
