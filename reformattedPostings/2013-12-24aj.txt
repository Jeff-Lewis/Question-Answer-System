Win McNamee / Getty Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday hinted at "big plans for 2014" in an end-of-the-year fundraising pitch to supporters of the Clinton Foundation, the Washington Post reported.In an email to supporters of the family's charitable foundation, Clinton wrote that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would match all donations up to Dec. 31.“We have big plans for 2014,” Clinton wrote in the email, as quoted by the Washington Post. The email detailed the charitable foundation's priorities, including initiatives for education, women's equality, and job skills development.In a similar vein, Clinton told ABC's Barbara Walters last week that the country's economic concerns were more pressing to her than the prospect of running for higher office. But a final decision on launching a presidential run was forthcoming in the new year, she said."I will look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year," Clinton said.
