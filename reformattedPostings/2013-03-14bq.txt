YouTubeLike everyone else on the Street, we watch financial television non-stop.  What's amazing is how much the reporters have changed their appearance over the years.  We have put together a "then and now" of several top financial TV reporters from CNBC, Fox Biz, and Bloomberg TV.  Some of them we found embarrassing hairstyles from the 80s and 90s and others adorable childhood shots.  Some of them really haven't changed all that much.   FREE AppDownload
