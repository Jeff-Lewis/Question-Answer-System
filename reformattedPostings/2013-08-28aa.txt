AP Photo/File  Before a roaring crowd on Wednesday, President Barack Obama delivered a highly anticipated speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.  It was every bit as inspirational as it was a call to action – to celebrate the progress America has made in closing the gaps of racial disparity while also remembering how very far we have left to go. "To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed – that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years," Obama said. "But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own."  With Obama's message in mind, we decided to turn to a recent study from the Pew Research Center, which sheds a lot of light on how Americans themselves feel about how far we have yet to come in closing the fault lines along racial disparity.  Here are several charts showing exactly where we have succeeded and where we are falling behind.  Pew Research Center  Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center  Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center Pew Research Center  Pew Research Center FREE AppDownload
