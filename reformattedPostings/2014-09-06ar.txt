AP ImagesMario Draghi. This week, ECB chief Mario Draghi unveiled a slew of new measures designed to boost the eurozone economy and prevent deflation. In addition to cutting interest rates, Draghi also committed to buying assets, in a strategy that some might liken to Quantitative Easing (though he's not buying government bonds). Naturally, there's a lot of skepticism about whether the measures can really revive the ailing eurozone economies. Well, here's one reason to be a little bit optimistic. It comes from Lorcan Roche Kelly of Agenda Research: Another bullish sign for today’s measures was the lack of unanimity on the governing council for the measures announced. If someone – presumably the Bundesbank – is dissenting, it is almost always a good sign for the effectiveness of new policies. Normally, in monetary policy, you hope to see unanimity. But this is a clever point. The Germans are loathe to support anything that is actually reinflating the economy through monetary policy. Tight money is kind of a religion at the Bundesbank (the German central bank). So if the Germans don't like what Draghi is doing, it's a sign that he's doing something potent. FREE AppDownload
