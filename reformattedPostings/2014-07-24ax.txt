YouTube/SodaStreamSodaStream is said to be in talks with an investment firm to go private, reports Bloomberg. Following the report shares of SodaStream were up as much as 18%. Bloomberg's David Wainer and Manuel Baigorri, citing people familiar with the matter, report that the deal could value the at-home soda maker at about $40 per share.  SodaStream, which is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market with about 33% of the stock's float currently held short, according to data from FinViz, has been one of the market's most volatile stocks in recent years. In February, after Coca-Cola announced a deal to take a 10% stake in Keurig, SodaStream shares plummeted.  Earlier this year, an April report from Israeli financial publication Calcalist said Pepsi was in talks to take a stake in the company. And since Coke took a stake in Keurig — and announced plans to develop a brewing system to brew cold drinks at home — many in the market have speculated that Pepsi could be a natural partner for SodaStream, though nothing official has emerged to date.   FREE AppDownload
