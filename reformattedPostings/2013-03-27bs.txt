It could turn out like Iceland, extending to many years.” Since the Cyprus deal last weekend, there's been a lot of talk about how in a sense Cyprus has already left the Eurozone. That's because in a regime where there's capital controls -- laws that prevent people from quickly moving their money out of a bank -- a euro in a Cyprus bank isn't worth what a Euro in a German bank is worth. You'd much rather have your money in a German bank, where there's no limits on withdrawals or transfers. If we're talking about capital controls for years, then that really means bad news for the 'Cypriot Euro.' FREE AppDownload
