We've had quite a big week of economic data. Some of it has been good, some of it has been bad, but volatility in the market has been quite low throughout. In the meantime, a couple of developments. Pfizer has jacked up its mega-bid for UK drugmaker AstraZeneca. RBS is higher on strong earnings. And that's about it. Stay with us for full Jobs Report coverage all morning. FREE AppDownload
