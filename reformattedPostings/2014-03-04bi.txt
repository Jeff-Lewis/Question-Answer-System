Home prices (including distressed sales) climbed 12% year-over-year in January, according to the latest CoreLogic home price report. This is the 23rd straight month of annual home price gains.  Month-over-month, home prices were up 0.9%. Ex-distressed sales (short sales and real estate owned transactions) home prices were up 9.8% on the year and 0.7% on the month. "Polar vortices and a string of snow storms did not manage to weaken house price appreciation in January," Mark Fleming, chief economist at CoreLogic said in a press release. "The last time January month-over-month and year-over-year price appreciation was this strong was at the height of the housing bubble in 2006."
