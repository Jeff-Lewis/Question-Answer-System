Russia Raises Main Rate as Ukraine Crisis Weighs on Ruble - Bloomberg Kerry Warns Putin on Ukraine as Russia Opens Troop Drills - Bloomberg Ukraine crisis escalates: What this means for investors – CNBC S&amp;P Slashes Russia To One Notch Above Junk – Business Insider Oh and at time like this we’ll need to check in at Zerohedge’s doom bunker: Ukraine Accuses Russia Of Wanting To Start World War III While I have no idea whether eastern Europe is on the brink of war, and I certainly hope it is not, it does make sense to position for heightened tensions as it does not appear there will be a diplomatic solution soon. On two separate occasions (first on March 6th: New Trade $EWG: Knocked Worst and then again on April 9th: New Trade – $EWG: Ukraine on Germany’s Parade) in the last 6 weeks, we put on a short EWG position in anticipation of Russian headline risk. We think short German equities is a good way to express a near term bearish view on the region, as Germany is one of Russia’s largest trading partners and seems to be the index most likely to trade in sympathy with Russian equity weakness. A quick look at the relative performance of Germany’s DAX, now down 2.1% from yesterday’s highs shows the correlation to Russia’s Micex equity index which is down 3.1% since yesterday’s open, while the FTSE 100 in the UK is only down 50 bps, and France’s CAC 40 down only 80 bps in that same time period. Yesterday, it appeared that another trader agreed with the thesis, and agrees that the price of short dated options in EWG (the iShares MSCI Germany etf) are cheap and bought 2500 of the May 31 puts for .45 and 5,000 of the May 30 puts for 20 cents when the etf was trading around $31.28.  We like this positioning given the cheap volatility.  Not necessarily as an outright bearish bet on the region, but merely that tensions will continue to run hot, the markets will likely anticipate this ahead of time, and we will close our position prior to what we hope will be some sort of diplomatic band aid. On a lighter note, I faced a bit of resistance to writing this post this morning, but not from a market participant that had a different view, but from Tom, my cat:  This article originally appeared at Risk Reversal .
