Davidslog.comBijan Sabet and David Karp after Tumblr sold to Yahoo for $1 billion.One of the largest outside shareholders in Twitter is Spark Capital. That's because Bijan Sabet, the firm's General Partner, led its initial Twitter investment in 2008 back when Jack Dorsey was CEO. Sabet also led investments in Tumblr, which sold to Yahoo for $1 billion and OMGPOP, which was acquired by Zynga for ~ $200 million. How does he help his firm pick home runs? And what's it like behind the scenes of a startup that's trying to grow out of a mess, into a success?  Sabet will talk about his experiences investing and growing companies at Startup 2013 on Thursday, October 24. He'll also reveal what investors are looking for in today's entrepreneurs. At Startup 2013, Business Insider will partner with General Assemb.ly to run Startup University.
