REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi For amusement: Years ago, whenever there was a market sell-off, my friend Tak Hallus (Stephen Robinett) would shout at his TV tuned to CNBC "Bring out the bears!".This was because CNBC would usually bring on the bears whenever there was a sell-off, and bulls whenever the market rallied.Today was no exception with Marc Faber on CNBC:  And Faber from August 8, 2013:  And from October 24, 2012:  Since the market is up 30% since his 2012 prediction, shouldn't he be expecting a 50% decline now?Friday:• At 8:30 AM ET, the Producer Price Index for March from the BLS.
