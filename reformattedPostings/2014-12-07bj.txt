Flickr/IkarasawaI flew from New York to London the other day. All else being equal, I would rather fly Business Class or First Class than Economy Class. But all else is distinctly not equal. So I don't. Happily, with some help from a friend, I have finally figured out how to fly First Class for the price of coach. (I'm not advocating this method for anyone else, by the way.)
