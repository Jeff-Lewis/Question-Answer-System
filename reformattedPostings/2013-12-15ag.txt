YouTube/hsdentfinancialHarry Dent lays out the ultimate bear case in his new book.Take one look at Harry Dent's body of work and you'll know he likes to make predictions. He wrote The Great Boom Ahead in 1993, The Great Jobs Ahead in 1995, The Great Depression Ahead in 2009, and The Great Crash Ahead in 2011. What's ahead now? A "demographic cliff," according to Dent's new book... Demographic Cliff: How to Survive and Prosper During the Great Deflation of 2014-2019. "At Dent Research we have a not-so-secret weapon: demographics," Dent writes. "It is the ultimate indicator that allows you to see around corners, to predict the most fundamental economic trends not just years but decades in advance." Dent spends the bulk of his book arguing that the demographic story has turned against the U.S. As Boomers retire, it's not an unfamiliar argument. Dent writes that an aging U.S. will cause deflation that will weaken the economy from 2014-2019. Here are some of his main points: "You need to prepare for that crisis, which will occur between 2014 and 2023, with the worst likely starting in 2014 and continuing off and on into late 2019," Dent concludes. "You can contribute to the solution by conserving your financial assets and reinvesting them after the crisis." Cheery stuff. You can get the book on Amazon.com. FREE AppDownload
