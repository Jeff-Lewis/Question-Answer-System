We recently had Peter Orszag (Citi Vice Chair and former Obama OMB director) in the office for a discussion on the U.S. budget. In a previous clip he explained the flawed assumptions behind the Paul Ryan budget. In this clip he offers his own ideas for the budget. Orszag favors a continued payroll tax holiday that's expiration is connected to the labor market. For the long term, he puts forth a Social Security reform that he thinks liberals could get behind. It would involve taxing a higher level of wages (to account for wage inflation) while also making benefits more progressive.  Produced by Business Insider Video FREE AppDownload
