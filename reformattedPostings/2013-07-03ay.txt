A one-time NYU professor, Mees sent Buiter more than 1,000 emails over a two-year period, authorities said. Some of them were laced with threats, while at least one was a hyper-sexual come-on. “What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b---s?” Mees allegedly wrote in one email. Buiter — who coined the term "Grexit" and is renowned for his work on sovereign debt — is married to Anne Sibert, who is also an economist.  They have two children together. According to the report, Mees was allegedly sending Sibert and the kids messages, too.   A lawyer for Mees told the paper that the emails between her client and Buiter "go in both directions."
