Courtesy of Roman WilsonCollege athletes have a much different college experience than any other student. On top of classes, homework, and a social life, athletes have to go to practice, meetings, and games. Roman Wilson, a senior wide receiver for the Princeton football team, is no stranger to that busy lifestyle. Wilson, who has caught 37 passes for 649 yards so far this season, is on the go from the time he wakes up in the morning, to when he finally gets to sleep at night. The week before Princeton played (and beat) Harvard, Wilson took us through a normal day in his life. That Saturday in Boston, Wilson caught the game-winning catch in the third overtime to lead the Tigers to victory. Disclosure: The author's father is a football coach at Princeton. FREE AppDownload
