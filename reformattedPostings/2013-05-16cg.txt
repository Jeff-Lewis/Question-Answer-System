REUTERS/Lyle Stafford Economists have been debating whether Canada's housing market was in a bubble and when that bubble would burst. In a new report, British Columbia-based Pacifica Partners Capital Management asserts that question is missing some much scarier stuff going on up north. Yes, housing is now in decline after largely avoiding the 2008 shock, they say. But everything else has also been going haywire: unemployment, credit, stocks, etc.  That is all the more remarkable, they argue, because Canada emerged from the 2008 crisis appearing a paragon of stability in the world. Pacifica quotes Horace to sum up the situation: "Many shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor."  "A pronounced shift in both Canadian and US economies has taken place," write Pacifica's analysts. "The Canadian economy, once the envy of Americans, Europeans, and others, is now widely viewed as a commodity dependent, “one trick pony”.  In a series of charts we've reproduced here, Pacifica shows how a "mean reversion" is taking place in North America, with the U.S. economy recovering while Canada's is for a world of hurt.
