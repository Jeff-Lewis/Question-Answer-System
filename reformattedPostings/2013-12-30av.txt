Workers in Harbin, China are gearing up for the city's 30th annual Harbin Ice and Snow Festival, a massive installation of sculptures and buildings made from ice.  The festival officially begins January 5th. According to organizers, nearly 10,000 workers will build the palatial structures, using some 180,000 square meters of ice and 150,000 square meters of snow, according to Reuters. Among other structures being prepared for this year's festival, one ice fortress appears to emulate a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the nation’s largest bank, according to Quartz.
