Shares of the company, which also owns the high-end Bloomingdale's chain, were down 5 percent at $56.77 in premarket trading. Macy's said it expects same-store sales to increase 1.5 percent to 2 percent for the full year. It had earlier forecast an increase of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The company's net income rose to $292 million, or 80 cents per share, in the three months ended Aug. 2 from $281 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $6.3 billion from $6.1 billion, after  declining about 2 percent in each of the last two quarters.
