Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat on Wednesday, implying that buyers were taking a pause following the biggest four-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since January 2013. * Major indexes jumped about 2 percent on Tuesday, lifted by strong corporate results, especially in the tech sector, and a Reuters report that the European Central Bank was considering buying corporate bonds. * The S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.2 percent over the past four sessions, putting it about 3.5 percent from its closing record, and up more than 6 percent from its session low last Wednesday, when the benchmark nearly reached correction territory. It closed Tuesday above both its 14-day moving average and its 200-day average, a sign of improving near-term momentum. * Earnings continue to be in focus. Late Tuesday, both Yahoo Inc  and Broadcom  posted better-than-expected revenue growth. Yahoo rose 3.3 percent to $41.52 in premarket trading and was the Nasdaq's most active premarket stock. * While earnings have largely come in strong so far this quarter, concerns continue to swirl over the pace of global economic growth and the timing of central bank policy changes. * Investors will be looking ahead to the consumer price index, which is seen as flat in September. The report, due at 8:30 a.m., is the first read on CPI since August's 0.2 percent dip, the first time prices fell in near 1-1/2 years, which was seen as lessening the urgency for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Futures snapshot at 6:55: * S&amp;P 500 e-minis  were falling 3.25 points, or 0.17 percent, with 180,299 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 1.75 points, or 0.04 percent, in volume of 23,940 contracts. * Dow e-minis  were down 3 points, or 0.02 percent, with 26,384 contracts changing hands.
