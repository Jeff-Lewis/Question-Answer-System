Spain's Repsol has bought Canada's Talisman Energy for $13 billion. That's $8 per share, a stock price Talisman hasn't seen since early October. This is all great news for Carl Icahn's Icahn Enterprises (IEP), the company's largest shareholder. He announced a 6% stake in the stock in October of last year and has since upped his holdings to over 7%, with more than 76 million shares. During that entire time Talisman's stock got absolutely demolished, falling 71%. News of the sale gave it a slight pop but not nearly enough to erase all those losses. It's still down just under 60% for the period. The second-largest holder of the stock, it's worth noting, is Point72 Asset Management — Steve Cohen's family office. Here's what the stock has looked like since Icahn bought it: Yahoo Finance Woof. Unfortunately for IEP, Talisman isn't the only energy stock in its portfolio — and as such, it's not the only stock that is getting crushed. In its third-quarter report, IEP acknowledged that these holdings blew a $270 million hole in its balance sheet, and losses have only gotten worse since the price of oil has declined. So despite Icahn's very public wins, like eBay and Apple, IEP's stock is down 16% year-to-date. Yahoo Finance   FREE AppDownload
