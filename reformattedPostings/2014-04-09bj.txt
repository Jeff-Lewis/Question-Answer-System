(1) Information Technology. For starters, let’s focus on the Information Technology sector. As you can see in our Performance Derby table, since March 5 through March 7, it is down 2.8%. Now let’s sort the performance for selected industries in the sector from worst to best and show the forward P/E at the end of March: Internet Software &amp; Services (-13.4%, 23.9), Application Software (-12.2, 36.1), Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services (-6.6, 19.7), Communications Equipment (1.9, 12.9), Systems Software (2.1, 13.5), Semiconductors (2.9, 14.9), and Semiconductor Equipment (4.8, 15.2). (2) Health Care. Now let’s do the same for the S&amp;P 500 Health Care sector, which is down 4.1% since March 5 through April 7: Health Care Technology (-12.9%, 32.7), Biotechnology (-12.4, 20.3), Health Care Distributors (-7.1, 16.5), Life Sciences Tools &amp; Services (-5.7, 17.0), Pharmaceuticals (-2.8, 16.8), Health Care Services (-2.5, 15.1), Health Care Equipment (0.5, 16.1), and Managed Health Care (2.7, 12.8). I’m seeing a pattern here of losses in the shares of industries with relatively high P/Es and gains in those with relatively low P/Es. Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: IMF’s Bullish Outlook.
