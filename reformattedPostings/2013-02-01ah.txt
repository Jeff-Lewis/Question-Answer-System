The Bank of America has been experiencing widespread outages since around 11 am today, and customers are not happy. If you're trying to get money out of a BoFA ATM or trying to use a debit card issued by them, chances are they're not working. Don't bother trying to log onto their website or mobile app either, cause they're also down. BoFA's tweeted this earlier today morning: We’re experiencing some technical issues and we are working to resolve as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience. ^bm (Via Kayla Tausche) Here's what BankofAmerica.com looks like right now. Bank Of America FREE AppDownload
