Barney Frank has told Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick that he would like to go back to Washington as an interim Senator filling John Kerry's Senate seat, Politico reports. The recently retired Congressman refused the idea before. In the likely event that John Kerry is confirmed as Secretary of State, his Senate seat will be open for three months before Massachusetts can hold a special election. It is up to Governor Patrick to appoint someone to fill the seat. From Politico: “A month ago, or a few weeks ago, I said I wasn’t interested,” Frank said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It was kind of like you’re about to graduate, and they said: ‘You gotta go to summer school.’ But [the fiscal cliff deal] now means that February, March and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history.” Other names have been thrown around for the position — specifically, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and former Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice Margaret Marshall — but Frank's name has been getting the most attention from journalists.  Frank does have a reputation for making things interesting... so can you blame them?     FREE AppDownload
