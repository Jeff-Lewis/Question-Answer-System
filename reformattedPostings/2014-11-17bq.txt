In September, strategist Adam Parker said the S&amp;P 500 could peak near 3,000 during this cycle.  In a recent note to clients, Morgan Stanley analysts identified 45 stocks that could work with the long-term recovery in mind. "Given the extremely long time horizon, we were agnostic about current valuation, focusing instead on fundamental business models," they wrote. "Starting from a list of over 100 equities highlighted by our analysts, we focused on stocks rated Overweight or Equal-weight in the context of the 12-month time horizon contemplated by Morgan Stanley’s stock-rating system," the analysts wrote. "We also examined each stock through the prism of our US Equity Strategy team’s quantitative stock-selection model, BEST, which ranks over 1,000 US stocks by their expected market-relative performance on a 24-month horizon." Most of the stocks are in financials, industrials and energy, which Morgan Stanley said typically perform in tandem with the economic cycle. FREE AppDownload
