REUTERS/Eric Thayer Joey Chestnut celebrates after winning at the annual Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island in the Brooklyn borough of New York July 4, 2014.One of the primary drivers of the ever higher stock market has been the boom in stock buybacks.  A recent report from FactSet shows that Q2 buybacks are down -1.1% on a year over year basis and down -23% on a quarter-over-quarter basis: “Quarterly Buybacks Declined Year-over-Year: Dollar-value share repurchases amounted to $123.7 billion over the second quarter and $539.3 billion for the trailing twelve months. Quarterly buybacks declined year-over-year (-1.1%) for the first time since Q3 2012. And, due to record post-recession activity last quarter, Q2 showed the most severe quarter-over-quarter decline (-22.9%) since Q4 2011.” FactSetDoes it matter?   It could matter a good deal.  If buybacks are bolstering stock prices in addition to helping companies bolster EPS then maybe it’s time to temper expectations about future returns.
