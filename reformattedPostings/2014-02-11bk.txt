Justin Sullivan/Getty Images(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (S.N) reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss than expected and a surprise increase in wireless subscribers, sending its shares up 4 percent in early trade. The company, which is 80 percent owned by Japan's SoftBank Corp 9984.T), said it added 58,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared with the average expectation for a loss of 83,500 from six analysts contacted by Reuters. Estimates ranged from a loss of 48,000 subscribers to a loss of 400,000 subscribers. The subscriber growth, which compared with a loss of 360,000 in the third quarter, included growth in connections for tablet computers and smartphones. The No. 3 U.S. mobile provider had been losing customers in recent quarters as it shut down its older Nextel network and other subscribers left due to technical problems related to a massive overhaul of Sprint's remaining network. Sprint said its loss narrowed to $1.04 billion, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $1.32 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly loss per share was much narrower than the average expectation for a loss of 33 cents per share according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $9.14 billion from $9.01 billion. The average analyst estimate was $8.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It forecast 2014 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, and capital spending of about $8 billion. Sprint shares rose to $8 in pre market trade after closing at $7.69 in the regular New York Stock Exchange session.
