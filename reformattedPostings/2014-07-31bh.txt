His hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, has a $1 billion short position on the company.  His most recent presentation was an attempt to uncover the questionable business practices of the company, through an investigation of its nutrition clubs. Ackman said Pershing spent $50 million on his research. Herbalife CEO John DeSimone rebutted his claims on Bloomberg TV the day of his presentation.
