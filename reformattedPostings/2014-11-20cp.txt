REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonJack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, on Oct. 27. Ma was speaking at a conference in China, following the company's IPO, the largest flotation in history.  The massive e-commerce firm is debuting its first bonds Thursday, with a massive issue expected to run to about $8 billion (£5.1 billion). Bloomberg has Ma charting how expectations for his firm, which was set up 16 years ago, have changed:  'Even two months before the IPO, people didn’t think we would make money,' Ma said in a speech today at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China. 'Now the problem is people think we are too good — we can do anything.' So far, Alibaba's performance has managed to buck the trend of China's economic slowdown and maintain rapid growth. Some analysts also told Bloomberg that comments like these were part of how Ma runs his business empire: 'This is Ma's typical speech style,' said Li Yujie, an analyst at RHB Research Institute in Hong Kong. 'He's probably worried that his staff will become too complacent, and wants to remind them that the company isn't as good as what people are expecting it to be.' Analysts are seeing Thursday's massive bond sale as both an opportunity and a threat: Investors in the West are not entirely comfortable with Chinese corporate governance, but Alibaba allows them to tap "the holy grail of retail, the Chinese consumer."   FREE AppDownload
