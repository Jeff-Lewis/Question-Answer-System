The study states that the “2013/2014 development cycle saw New York (with 24 drama projects retained) dethrone Los Angeles (with 19 drama projects retained) to become North America’s most attractive location for one-hour TV pilot production.” Basically, L.A. is losing more and more pilots to other cities. “Overall, Los Angeles retained only 90 projects (19 one-hour dramas and 71 half-hour comedies) out of 203 tracked during the ‘13/’14 development cycle, yielding a 44 percent pilot production share. Last year, L.A.’s pilot production share was 52 percent, and six years earlier, a commanding 82 percent.” FilmL.A. President Paul Audley stated that “Losing television pilots – and then series – to other North American competitors leads to the destruction of steady, well-paying California jobs.”  In total, there were 91 drama pilots produced outside of Los Angeles, which is a record number.  The report, which is fascinating and definitely worth a read, also mentions that more shows skipped traditional pilot testing and went “straight-to-series” in this development cycle than ever before, partially thanks to new, untraditional release models put forth by Netflix and other online streaming services.  Netflix By the end of the year, Netflix will have a total of eleven original series and seven more are already in development to be released in 2015. Netflix’s popular series “House of Cards” is filmed in Maryland, while “Orange is The New Black” and the upcoming Marvel “Daredevil” series are shot in New York, and according to the report, “The lost opportunity to the California economy from just these three Netflix series approaches $475 million.” FREE AppDownload
