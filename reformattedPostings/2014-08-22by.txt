Revenue for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 2 rose to $1.73 billion. Wall Street on average had expected the U.S. game store chain to report revenue of $1.65 billion. Shares of the company gained 6.2 percent to $43 after-hours, from a close of $40.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Titles such as Ubisoft`s "Watch Dogs" and Nintendo`s "Mario Kart 8" drove a 15.6 percent gain in new software sales and a 21.9 percent gain in comparable-store sales. Strong demand for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's Playstation 4 helped new hardware sales more than double. Net earnings for the second quarter more than doubled to $24.6 million, or 22 cents a share, from $10.5 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. For its fiscal third quarter, GameStop forecast comparable store sales growth of 1 to 5 percent. It maintained its outlook for fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share at $3.40 to $3.70.   (Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
