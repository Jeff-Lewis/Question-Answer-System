This week markets will probably be quiet again as many investors and traders will likely be preparing for and recovering from New Year's Eve festivities. However, there is a lot of economic data coming to kick off 2014. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary One thing that has the market's bulls and bears split is the direction of corporate profit margins, which are near all-time highs. "Will profit margins contract?" asked Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius rhetorically. "No." "[T]he most important driver of profit margins is the gap between price inflation and unit labor cost inflation," said Hatzius. "When prices grow faster than unit labor costs, firms typically manage to raise their profit margins, and vice versa. In our view, the price/ULC gap is likely to move back into slightly positive territory in 2014. ...[T]he underlying trend calculated from the three primary measures of hourly wages—average hourly earnings, the employment cost index, and compensation per hour—is still only growing 2%. Going forward, we expect only a modest acceleration to perhaps 2.5%. Meanwhile, we expect productivity growth to reaccelerate to 1.5%-2%. Together, these numbers imply unit labor cost growth of 0.5%-1%, which would be slightly below the rate of price inflation of 1%-1.5%. "Of course, the price/ULC gap is not the only driver of margins. But other factors are also likely to look reasonably friendly. We expect foreign profits to improve in 2014 as the global economy gathers some momentum, and see no major changes in corporate income taxes or financial profits." FREE AppDownload
