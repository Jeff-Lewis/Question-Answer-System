Yesterday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo delivered his State of the State address. In the accompanying "NY Rising" book, he acknowledged the reality of climate change and the need to prepare New York's infrastructure for stronger and more frequent storms. Superstorm Sandy devastated New York City's transportation network: Tunnels for subways and cars flooded, and full service still has not been completely restored. To prevent future, costly flooding (the damage done to a single subway station will cost about $500 million to repair), Cuomo presented several measures. Here's what he wants New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority and other State agencies and authorities to do, with federal assistance: To prevent the severe gasoline shortage caused by Sandy, Cuomo's plan proposes requiring "gas stations in strategic locations" to have back-up power capacity, so they can distribute fuel during a power outage. But some argue these plans, while practical and executable, do not go far enough. Second Ave. Sagas, a blog about New York's subway system, criticized Cuomo's "lack of attention" to New York City's transit needs, pointing out the 300 page plan mentions the MTA only once. Transportation Nation notes Cuomo's plan does not include the expansion of New York's bus rapid transit system, called for in a draft report by the NYS 2100 Commission, created by Cuomo to improve New York's emergency preparedness. The argument for more buses is based on the idea that routes are flexible and do not rely on tunnels that can flood, so service can be restored quickly after a storm.
