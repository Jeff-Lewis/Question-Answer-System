Michael Seto / BIGroupon's Andrew Mason released a very honest exit letter yesterday after getting fired as CEO, where he talked about weight gain and Battletoads. He began the letter by saying, "I've decided that I'd like to spend more time with my family. Just kidding — I was fired today." It may have been a controversial style of saying "goodbye," but it isn't entirely unique. Who could forget Greg Smith's op-ed piece in the NYT last year calling Goldman Sachs a "toxic and destructive" workplace? And Smith isn't the first banking executive to quit using the NYT's op-ed page either. We've compiled 14 epic quitting examples of all time.
