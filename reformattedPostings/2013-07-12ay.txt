The company recalled 17% of its bottoms for being too sheer in March. The problem was later traced to a testing error.  Despite the company's insistence that the problem is solved, customers continue to complain on forums that the pants are see through.  Liz Dunn, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, wrote in a note this week that sheer pants are a persistent problem at Lululemon.  The issue comes at a dangerous time: Lululemon has faced a deluge of competition from brands including Gap's Athleta.  “We see a narrow window of opportunity for Lululemon to really fix quality,” Dunn wrote. "Otherwise, customers may jump ship to competing brands." FREE AppDownload
