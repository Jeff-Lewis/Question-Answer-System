European markets as represented by the Stoxx 600 have moved 28.4% in the past 12 months through Friday translated into U.S .dollars. "Since the start of the year, that market has moved higher by 9.41% in U.S. dollar terms potentially offering further upside as the regional economy and the economies of the region’s export customers improve," says Stoltzfus.
