EPS for the fourth quarter came in at $1.28.  Sales for the quarter came in at $1.27 billion.   The stock is up more than 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement.  Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells weight loss products, is one of the closely followed stocks on Wall Street these days. The company has been at the center of a huge hedge fund battle for over a year now.   In December 2012, Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, publicly declared that he was shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife.  His thesis is that the company operates as a pyramid scheme and that regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to investigate and shut down the company.  Right after Ackman publicly revealed his short, his arch-nemesis Carl Icahn piled on by amassing a huge long position. Icahn, who has made hundreds of millions on his position, has said that Ackman will be the victim of "the mother of all short squeezes." A number of other fund managers have gone long the stock, too.  Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."
