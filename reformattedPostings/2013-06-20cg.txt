The Spanish government sold 1.3 billion euros worth of bonds maturing in 2018 at a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.2, down from 4.1 at the previous auction for similar bonds. It also sold 1.1 billion worth of bonds maturing in 2021 (bid-to-cover of 2.0, down from 2.1) and 1.5 billion euros worth of bonds maturing in 2023 (bid-to-cover of 1.8, down from 2.5).
