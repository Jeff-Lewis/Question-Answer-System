The funding round — led by All-Stars Investment, a fund run by former Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Ji — is expected to close as early as Monday.  At $45 billion, Xiaomi would be more valuable than most other Silicon Valley technology startups, including Uber, which just closed a funding round that valued the ride-sharing startup at $41 billion. Xiaomi has made a name for itself in emerging markets thanks to its phones that are highly similar to Apple’s high-end devices but sold at extremely low prices. The company shipped 18 million handsets in its most recent quarter — a whopping year-over-year growth of 239% during that period.
