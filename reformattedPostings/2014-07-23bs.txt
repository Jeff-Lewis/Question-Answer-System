BIIFifteen months ago, when Apple investors gave up on the stock, I bought it.  Happily, I still own it. I don't think the stock is grossly undervalued anymore, the way it was when it was at $56 ($391 in the old split). On the contrary, I think it's overvalued. But I also think that the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle is going to be monstrous and that, as launch day approaches, the excitement is going to be so great that the stock will surge even higher. I still have long-term concerns about the sustainability of Apple's gargantuan profits (and profit growth), so after the orgasmic iPhone 6 climax, I will likely take a breather. I also recognize that the iPhone 6 launch may already be reflected in the stock price, so I may just be being greedy by hanging on. In any event, here's what I thought about Apple's second quarter results: BII BII So that's what I thought of the quarter. I love Apple's products, I think Tim Cook's doing a good job, and I think the company will be able to maintain its "premium" positioning, but I still think the relentless pressure on global gadget prices will eventually put pressure on its profit margin and profit growth. So I doubt I'll own the stock much longer. But in the meantime, bring on the iPhone 6! SEE ALSO: The iPhone 6 Is Going To Nuke iPad Sales—And That's Great! FREE AppDownload
