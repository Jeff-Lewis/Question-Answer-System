REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin A worker operates an electrolysis furnace, which produces aluminium from raw materials, at the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, May 18, 2011.Mounting controversy and alleged market manipulation has led Washington legislators to take a stronger look at major banks' hold over commodities, with the Fed to possibly reevaluate regulation in the coming months.
