The S&amp;P 500 just hit a new intraday all-time high of 1,881. This comes exactly five years after it hit an intraday low of 666.79 on March 6, 2009. That's a 182% gain. "Should this bull market celebrate its sixth birthday, and perform similarly to prior sixth-year bulls, we could be up another 26% to beyond 2340," said S&amp;P Capital IQ's Sam Stovall earlier this week. "As always, use history as a guide, not gospel, especially since there has been a limited number of sixth-year bulls." S&P Dow Jones Indices FREE AppDownload
