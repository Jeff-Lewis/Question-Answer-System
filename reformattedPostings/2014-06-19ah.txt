It reported Q4 adjusted EPS of 92 cents and revenue of $11.3 billion.  Analysts were expecting 95 cents per share on $11.48 billion in revenue. So that's an all-around miss.  The stock is dropping in after-hours trading. Oracle's sales increased 3%, which is good. But analysts were expecting a healthy year-over-year nearly 5% increase in sales this quarter, which is historically Oracle's biggest as salespeople push to close deals and make their year-end quotas and bonuses. This was also its fiscal fourth quarter. For the year, Oracle reported $2.87 EPS (excluding special items) and $38.3 billion in revenue. Analysts were looking for $2.91 in earnings per share for the year on $38.45 billion in revenue. So that's another all-around miss. Last year, it also reported a miss on revenue, both for the fourth quarter and for the year, although it was spot on with profits. It reported 87 cents EPS for the quarter and $2.68 EPS for the year. It brought in $10.95 billion in revenue for the quarter and $37.18 billion for the year.  Oracle has been struggling off and on to meet revenue targets for a while now and spent much of its fiscal 2013 in cost-cutting mode, analysts told Business Insider. One analyst told us that many employees didn't get their full 2013 bonuses or any bonus at all. As for its fiscal 2014, that's been hit or miss, too, particularly on revenues. Last quarter: a miss, the quarter before that, a much-needed beat, and the previous three quarters, all misses.  Oracle declared cash dividend of $0.12.

"Our cloud subscription business is now approaching a run rate of $2 billion a year," said Oracle President and CFO Safra Catz.

We're making this transition to cloud subscriptions and ratable revenue recognition while continuously increasing our top-line revenue and our bottom-line profits year-after-year." "We have transformed Sun's commodity hardware business into a profitable and growing Engineered Systems business," said Oracle President Mark Hurd. "Our overall hardware business grew 2% in constant currency this past year. We saw record levels of Engineered Systems shipments and expect to deliver our 10,000th unit in Q1." "Oracle is now the second largest SaaS company in the world,&amp;quot; said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "In SaaS, we're in front of everybody but salesforce.com. In IaaS we're larger and more profitable than Rackspace. We have by far the most complete portfolio of modern SaaS and PaaS products in the industry: CRM: Sales, Service &amp; Marketing; HCM: HR, Payroll &amp; Talent; ERP: Accounting, Procurement, Supply Chain &amp; more. All these SaaS products run on the world's most powerful PaaS: the Oracle in-memory multitenant database and Java. We plan to increase our focus on the Cloud and become number one in both the SaaS and the PaaS businesses.&amp;quot; The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of outstanding common stock.
