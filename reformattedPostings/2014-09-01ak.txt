ReutersIn honor of Labor Day, which was signed into law as a national holiday in 1894, I'd like to share some graphical snapshots of a major change in our nation's workforce over the decades. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics has monthly data on employment by industry categories reaching back to 1939. The first chart below is an overlay of the compete series of employment numbers for the two major categories, manufacturing and services industries. When I say major, I'm referring to the complete domination of the labor market by these two industries -- anywhere between 91.3% to 95.3% of total nonfarm employment. In 1939 service industries employed more people than manufacturing by a ratio of 2.1-to-1.0. But that ratio was soon to change. For a clearer picture of the relative growth of manufacturing and services, the next chart illustrates just that: The cumulative growth of the two series, along with total nonfarm employment.

Thereafter, manufacturing employment has had a complex history with a peak in the late 1970s and a secular decline thereafter. Here are some observations about manufacturing and services over the past seven plus decades: I'll close with a curious overlay of the population-adjusted growth of the services industries since 1948 and the S&amp;P Composite (the S&amp;P 500 with a few years of the S&amp;P 90 spliced at the front end). The correlation is quite remarkable.  Click for a larger image Happy Labor Day to all! FREE AppDownload
