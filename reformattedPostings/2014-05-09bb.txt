Tyrese Gibson, FacebookDr. Dre and Tyrese.Thursday it was reported Apple was in talks to pay $3.2 billion for Beats Electronics, which makes audio gear (mostly headphones) and offers a streaming music service that competes with Spotify. One of the founders of Beats is the rapper Dr. Dre, who stands to make a fortune if the deal happens. FacebookNick Summers at The Next Web spotted a video posted to Facebook Thursday night may have confirmed the deal. It was posted by actor Tyrese Gibson, who happened to be with Dre Thursday night after the deal was reported. In it, Gibson tells the camera that they're going to have to change the Forbes list now — that is, because of Dre's windfall. We originally had the full video in here, but Tyrese Gibson has taken it down in the last few minutes. However, Doug Kass points us to WorldStarHipHop's rip of the video. It's on YouTube.
