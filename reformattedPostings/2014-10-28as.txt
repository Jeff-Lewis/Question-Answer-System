Maurizio Tagliavia waits for the helicopter to land while holding champagne at the Villa Del Quar, near Verona April 15, 2014.As the expression goes: tis the season to be jolly. And that certainly rings true for Wall Streeters, who are expecting fantastic bonuses this season. Over three-quarters of Wall Streeters expect a bonus this year, according to eFinancialCareer's latest Bonus Expectations Survey. And of those, 60% percent are expecting the bonuses to increase. Not bad. These numbers are significant jumps from last year. Only 59% expected a bonus last year, and of those only 42% expected an increase. "Money is important for a significant proportion of survey respondents: nearly half of respondents (45%) say that compensation is the most important reason in their decision to work in the financial services industry, and the majority (56%) would not be open to a reduced bonus in exchange for additional benefits," the report states. Survey respondents are split on whether this major bonus bump is a longer trend at firms, or just happening this year.  Regardless, this season's looking really good.
