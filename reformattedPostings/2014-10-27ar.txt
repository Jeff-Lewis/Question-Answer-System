The world's largest biotechnology company's net profit fell for the quarter primarily due to a $376 million charge related to restructuring moves it announced in late July. Amgen said it now expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $8.45 to $8.55 per share, up from the boosted forecast it provided in July of $8.20 to $8.40 per share. The company expects full-year revenue of $19.8 billion to $20 billion. It previously forecast $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion. Amen posted a net profit of $1.24 billion, or $1.61 per share, down from a profit of $1.37 billion, or $1.79 per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.30 per share. Analysts on average expected $2.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Chris Reese) FREE AppDownload
