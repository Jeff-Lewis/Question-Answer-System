After spending 40 years on Wall Street building Perella Weinberg, a global investment firm, Joe Perella has seen people come and go. In an interview with financial career site OneWire, he shared what he thinks gives people real staying power — the power to build a successful business and brand in an incredibly competitive industry. “I think successful people work harder than the average person,” Perella said. “They’re all smart. There are a lot of smart people in this world that aren’t successful. Luck enters into it. I call it serendipity. But you make your luck by really working hard … beyond your maximum level.” Even more than that, Perella said, successful people don't have a maximum level. That is to say, they're always pushing for more. There is no top. There is no success for successful people. "They're never satisfied," Perella said. "They know they can do it better than they did it yesterday, and they come to work every day saying, 'How do I do it better? How do I make a better firm? How do we earn a better return for our investors?'" Meta, right? Perella urged young kids starting out in finance to keep these traits in mind, and when they're heading to interview to remember that everyone is good. In fact, everyone is great. The question is why you want to do the work and what you know about the firm. Watch the insightful interview. (Below is Part II of the two-part interview with Perella.
