Shares of Kroger, which owns the Ralphs, Smith's and Food 4 Less grocery chains and supplement seller Vitacost.com, rose as much as 1.3 percent to $52.57 in early trading. Kroger completed the $2.5 billion acquisition of North Carolina-based Harris Teeter on Jan. 29, adding more than 200 supermarkets, mostly in the U.S. southeast. Its roughly $280 million acquisition of online vitamin and supplements seller Vitacost.com closed on Aug. 18. Kroger raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the year ending January to $3.22-$3.28 per share from $3.19-$3.27. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $3.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised its forecast for same-store sales, excluding fuel, to 3.50-4.25 percent from 3-4 percent at supermarkets open without expansion or relocation for five quarters. Kroger, whose rivals include Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Safeway Inc  and Whole Foods Market Inc , is seen as one of the top performers in the hyper-competitive U.S. supermarket industry. Up to Wednesday's close, Kroger's shares had jumped 31.2 percent this year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Food Retail Index , which rose 1.4 percent. Net income attributable to Kroger rose to $347 million, or 70 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 16 from $317 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Total sales rose 12 percent to $25.3 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 69 cents per share and sales of $24.92 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, were up 4.8 percent, higher than the 4.2 percent increase analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected.
