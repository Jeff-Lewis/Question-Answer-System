This was down 1 percent month-over-month. Certain housing markets have recovered well and economists are getting increasingly bullish about the national housing recovery. But housing is a local story and many continue to suffer from an extremely high foreclosure rate.  "Although the overall national foreclosure trend continues to head lower, late-blooming foreclosures are bolting higher in some local markets where aggressive foreclosure prevention efforts in previous years are wearing off,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac in a press release. We drew on RealtyTrac's report to highlight the 14 metros with the highest foreclosure rate. Note: The metros are ranked by foreclosure rate i.e. 1 in every X homes received a foreclosure filing.
