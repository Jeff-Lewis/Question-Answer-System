Keep in mind that analysts tend to be too optimistic, so their estimates tend to be revised downwards.

(2) S&amp;P 500 NERI also turned more negative in February, to -6.6, the lowest since January 2013. Guidance provided during the Q4-2013 earnings season caused analysts to reduce their estimates for the first quarter and all of 2014.  (3) Europe NERI fell to -11.0 this month, the lowest since December 2011. It’s rather odd that this index is so weak given the solid improvements in the region's M-PMIs and NM-PMIs.  (4) Emerging Markets NERI declined from -3.0 last month to -5.3 this month. It has been negative since March 2011. Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: The Future Is Coming.
