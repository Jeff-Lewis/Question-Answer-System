Quick heads up. It's now been 14 straight sessions of alternating up/down days for the market. Jonathan Krinsky of Miller Tabak calls this a "Christmas Tree" pattern and writes:  Monday continued the "Christmas Light Pattern" of red and green days for the SPX, making it 14 in a row. The result was a close back at 1563, a common level over the past month. While this could be considered a bullish consolidation, we continue to be concerned with the momentum that continues to wane on each push back to 1563.
