"In Q3, our SaaS revenue alone grew well over 100% as lots of new customers adopted our Sales, Service, Marketing and Human Capital Management applications in the Cloud." "This month we will begin deliveries of servers based on our new SPARC T5 microprocessor: the fastest microprocessor in the world," said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison.
