Trump hasn't been too happy with Schneiderman — the AG sued "Trump University" for allegedly running a scam university that hurt at least 5,000 students across the country. Schneiderman wants Trump to cough up $40 million in restitution. Trump says Schneidmerman is "crooked" and the "dumbest attorney general" in the U.S. Atlantic Wire Trump's lawyer Jeffrey Goldman filed the complaint with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, alleging that Schneiderman met with Trump's daughter Ivanka at a bar while he was investigating Trump University (which, to be clear, is not a real university, and has been renamed The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative). Trump says the AG asked Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, for favors while conveniently leaving out the fact that he was planning to sue Trump.  The suit against Trump alleges that he and his organization made false claims about the classes and his level of involvement in Trump U, which isn't licensed as an educational institution.
