Buybacks will grow 18% next year after a 26% gain in 2014. S&amp;P 500 companies are also expected to increase dividend payouts at a 7% annualized rate through 2017. "Although we expect a gradual shift toward investing for growth via capital expenditures and M&amp;A as confidence in the US economy grows, the popularity of dividends and buybacks should continue, particularly given the risks posed by struggling economies in Europe and Asia," Sneider wrote. We drew on Goldman's "Total Cash Return to Shareholders" basket to highlight the stocks with the largest combined realized buyback and dividend yields. Total yield is calculated as the sum of gross buybacks and dividends as a share of market cap. These 15 stocks have a total yield greater than 14%. Note: they are not intended to serve as a well-diversified portfolio. FREE AppDownload
