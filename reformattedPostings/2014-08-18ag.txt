Aeropostale announced today that its CEO Thomas Johnson will leave the company. Julian Geiger, who previously served as the company's CEO, will re-join the company in the same capacity.  Johnson was named the clothing chain's sole CEO on December 1, 2010, and since that date, Aeropostale shares have fallen more than 85% from around $25 per share to $3.24 as of Monday's close. Aeropostale also said Monday that in the second quarter, sales fell 13% to $396.2 million from $454 million, and the company expects to lose $0.80 to $0.83 pe share in the quarter. Excluding certain items, losses are expected to be $0.42 to $0.45 in the second quarter.  And in after hours trade Monday, investors were shaking off the poor results and cheering a new presence at the top of the company, with shares up more than 7%.  But it's not just the stock price that paints a picture of how awful Johnson's tenure as CEO really was.  On Twitter, Rob Wilson, president of Tiburon Research Group, tweeted a chart showing operating margins for Aeropostale since Johnson was named CEO. (The operating margin represents a company's pre-tax, pre-interest profits as a percentage of sales.) At the time Johnson took the helm at Aeropostale, margins were running at about 16%. As of the second quarter of this year, those margins had fallen to -8%.  As Wilson said on Twitter, "Possibly the absolute worst tenure in specialty apparel retail history comes to an end at [Aeropostale]." Here's Wilson's chart, which shows the staggering decline in margins at Aeropostale over the last four years.  @RetailRobWilson  FREE AppDownload
