 Facebook/Seminole Golf CourseSummer is around the corner, which means that golf season is about to go into full swing. We partnered with search engine FindTheBest to come up with a list of the 10 best golf courses in America. To create the rankings, FindTheBest looked at reviews from experts at Golf Digest, Golf.com, and GolfLink.com, and came up with an average rating for each course. It also factored in the USGA Course and Slope Ratings, which evaluate the difficulty of a course for bogey (more amateur) and scratch players (more professional) players. FREE AppDownload
