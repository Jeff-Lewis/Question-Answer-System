Magharebia/FlickrThere are just two days to go until automatic, across-the-board budget cuts kick in, and if they do, education is going to get hit hard. The cuts will roll back Education Department funding below what it was in 2004. But since 2004, the number of students enrolled in public pre-K-12 and all post secondary education programs have gone up by 5.8 million, and the cost of providing public K-12 schooling has gone up 36 percent, according to a recent report from the National Education Association (NEA). In this report, the NEA analyzed data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and calculated exactly how much funding specific educational programs stand to lose, how many students will be affected, and how many jobs would potentially be lost as a result of these budget cuts. Business Insider took this data and created a series of interactive maps that show you exactly how the sequester would affect the education system in each state. The report claims that, if the cuts kick in, 7.4 million students would be affected — which means that either the quality of education they receive will go down or be eliminated entirely, The funding cuts could also lead to 49,365 potential job losses. But not all states will feel the hit equally. With more than $100 million cuts to their education budget, the states that will be most affected by the sequester are California, Texas, Illinois, New York and Florida. FREE AppDownload
