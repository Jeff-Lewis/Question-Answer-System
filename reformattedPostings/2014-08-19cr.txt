Earlier this month, the National Development and Reform Commission said the government had completed investigations into 12 Japanese auto parts makers and was preparing to hand out punishment according to the law. Sectors from autos to pharmaceuticals have come under the spotlight as China seeks to tighten compliance with anti-monopoly laws. NSK Ltd  said the regulator issued a 174.9 million yuan ($28.5 million) fine over unspecified violations of the China's antitrust law. Rival NTN Corp  also said the Chinese regulator ordered it to pay a 119.2 million yuan fine. "NSK and its subsidiaries... have taken and will continue to take comprehensive measures with the help of outside experts and others to ensure strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations," the Tokyo-based company said in a statement. NTN said it would conduct its business while adhering to principles of fair and honest competition. Both companies said should any revisions be made to their profit forecasts for the financial year to March 2015, they would be announced swiftly.
