elPadawan / FlickrTrump Entertainment plans to file for bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg. The holding company owns and operates two casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal. Both hotel-casinos have been under considerable financial duress — so much so that company founder Donald Trump, who still owns 10% of the Trump Entertainment, has asked that his name be removed from both buildings. The casinos, he argued, have not lived up to the "high standards of quality and luxury" associated with the Trump brand. Of course, Trump is not alone in its struggles. All of Atlantic City is suffering from dismal casino revenue. Not even the massive Revel Casino — a $2.2 billion project meant to symbolize a new era for the city — could draw visitors back. It filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. This Bloomberg chart of monthly slot machine revenue in Atlantic City says pretty much everything you need to know about the situation.

Also on Monday, Christie convened a special closed-door summit to address the casino closures. Since January roughly 8,000 casino workers have lost their jobs. FREE AppDownload
