A few weeks ago we wrote about the fact that The Tie Bar had a custom van driving around Manhattan — mostly around Wall Street banks — handing out accessories like ties, pocket squares etc. And according to our friends at The Tie Bar, you guys showed up. Nice job. There's even a video that came out of it, is pretty funny. What's more important than a few laughs, though, is that learned a key lesson that week, and that is that the fashion help you so desperately need is somewhere out there.  Apparently it just needs to find you.
