Joshua Lott/Getty ImagesThe latest monthly U.S. retail sales data are out. Total sales unexpectedly fell 0.4% in January from the previous month, and December's 0.2% advance was revised down to a 0.1% drop. Economists were looking for no change from December. Excluding autos, sales were flat, slightly below estimates for a 0.1% advance. December's 0.7% gain was revised down to 0.3%. Excluding both autos and gas, sales were down 0.2%, below estimates for a 0.1% rise, and December's 0.6% gain was revised down to 0.1%. The retail sales control group, which feeds into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.3%, below expectations for a 0.2% rise. The December retail sales control group gain was revised down to 0.3% from 0.7%. "This report was quite weak, and the disappointing performance among components that depend on foot traffic such as sales at auto dealers, department stores, and at restaurants suggests that the weakness may be due in part to the unusually cold conditions," says Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy at TD Securities. "However, with online sales also dipping, after steady growth during the previous four months, there may be some indication that other factors beyond the usual weather effect suspect may be at play. That said, the big downward revision to core consumer spending in December does provide some downside risks to our expectation for a downgrade to Q4 GDP estimate to 2.8%, from 3.2%."
