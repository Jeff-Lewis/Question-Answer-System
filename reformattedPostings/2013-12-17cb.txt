The only woman appears on a Irish business networking site.   And the man with Down's syndrome – Patrick Kingsely of The Guardian notes that it's a nod to the new charter's provisions for people with disabilities – can be found on this Arizona business website. To top it all off, the Arabic text misspelt the word "Egyptians" as "determined."
