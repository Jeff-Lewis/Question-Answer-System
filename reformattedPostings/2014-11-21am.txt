Skinny jeans-wearing, beard-toting 20- and 30-somethings are flocking to areas in which they feel right at home. These are areas chock-full of trendy food trucks, as in Austin's East Austin neighborhood; theater festivals, as in the Shimokitazawa neighborhood of Tokyo; and thrift stores, as in Stockholm's Södermalm. After scouring the globe, we found the most hipster neighborhoods in cities around the world.
