REUTERS/China DailyA man looks at an electronic board showing stock information at a brokerage house in Shanghai March 15, 2011. China's main stock index closed down 1.4 percent on Tuesday, as worries that China's central bank will continue to drain funds from the financial system added to fears about Japan's nuclear crisis. Markets turned red again today as Japan got whacked down 1.94% in overnight trading. Shanghai was up 0.60%, but Hong Kong fell 1.25%. Emerging markets are getting crushed and Japanese futures are falling more. In Europe, things were also down across the board. France's CAC 40 is trading down 1.4% while England's FTSE and Germany's DAX are both down as well. Once again, the Australian dollar is getting hammered. All of this comes a day after a very wild day in the markets. China's flash PMI missed expectations, sending Asian markets into a tizzy. And the currency markets were also nuts yesterday, with the Argentinian peso falling 13% against the dollar. U.S. futures were pointing to a much lower open. It's been a relatively quiet week of economic data. No major releases today. FREE AppDownload
