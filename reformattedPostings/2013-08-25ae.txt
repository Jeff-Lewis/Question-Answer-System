APSynchronized anything is a rare sight.At this point, the market economists expect the Federal Reserve to announce on September 18 that it will begin tapering its monthly $85 billion purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds. Of course, there will be plenty of economic data before the 18th that the Fed will consider before setting anything in stone. In particular, there will be a lot of updates on the state of U.S. jobs. "Between now and the August employment report (released September 6), market  participants will be keenly scrutinizing the economic data for clues as to how the labor market performed this month," said Deutsche Bank's Brett Ryan in his discussion about Fed tapering. "While we expect the August employment report to be the key determinate, other labor market indicators, such as the jobs plentiful/jobs hard-to-get component of the August consumer confidence report (Tuesday), jobless claims, and the employment component of the Chicago PMI (Friday) take on added significance." "The fact that the 4-week moving average on jobless claims is at its lowest level since November 2007 bodes well for a firming tone in other labor market indicators." It also bodes well that we may be witnessing synchronized global growth.
