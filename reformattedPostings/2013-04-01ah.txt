The Fast Diet Nina Buckley is a sucker for donuts, McDonald's Big Macs, and Indian takeout — food hankerings that can easily derail any diet devotee's quest to lose weight. That's why after three months on Weight Watchers, the mother of three found she had actually gained a few pounds. "It's like being teased with your favorite foods you can't have," said Buckley, 28, who lives in England but is originally from Romania. Buckley is one of the countless men and women who are grappling with how to eliminate pounds without having to sacrifice a lot of food. The FastDiet, which recommends eating about a quarter of your typical calorie intake for two days a week, and eating normally for the other five, meets dieters half-way. Buckley has taken to this "forgiving" diet approach.   The FastDiet's designers, Dr. Michael Mosley and journalist Mimi Spencer, both of the U.K., claim that their 5:2 plan makes you lose weight faster than other diets. They've written a book about the science behind their diet theory and why they think it works. During these "fasting days" dieters can take in their calories — a maximum of 600 for men and 500 for women — in one meal or break it into multiple small plates.  As for whether it works, as always, the proof is in the pudding. Buckley claims to have lost 13 pounds after four weeks. She's done it by eating chicken and steamed broccoli, chili con carne, and yes, even pork casserole, all for 500 little calories or less during her fasting days.  "This diet it's easy because I know I have to be strict for only two days, then the rest of the week I'm eating when I'm hungry. My appetite has reduced significantly," said Buckley.  A Facebook fanpage allows fellow FastDieters to interact by sharing their meals, and weight-loss success.   We've rounded up some of the meals to give you an idea of what FastDiet meals are like. Most of them look good. There are lots of vegetables and lean proteins. The question is: how long did the dieters last?
