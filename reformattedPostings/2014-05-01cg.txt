A deal would likely be worth at least $40 billion, DirecTV's current market capitalization, the newspaper said. A combination of AT&amp;T and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast Corp &lt;CMCSA.O&gt; will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc &lt;TWC.N&gt;, the Journal said. (http://r.reuters.com/qad98v) Representatives for AT&amp;T were not immediately available for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. DirecTV spokesman Robert Mercer said the company does not comment on speculation. Comcast Corp this week agreed to a three-way deal with Charter Communications Inc &lt;CHTR.O&gt; as part of Comcast's efforts to win regulatory approvals for its proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable.
