REUTERS/Jason ReedFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has a big day today. At 2 PM ET, the Fed will release its latest FOMC monetary policy decision and updated macroeconomic forecasts. Then, at 2:30, Bernanke will take the stage for a highly-anticipated press conference and Q&amp;A. Of course, the biggest thing everyone wants to know from the Fed today pertains to tapering back the pace of bond buying. Should investors really expect the Fed to begin tapering this year? If the language in the FOMC statement out at 2 strikes a dovish tone, markets will imply that the answer is "no." Either way, though, the market will probably get the answer before Bernanke's press conference. And in the event that markets don't get their answer from the statement... "None of the journalists attending today’s FOMC press conference will want to waste a question on something as simple as when he might taper, because surely, someone else will do that for the benefit of everyone else in the room," says Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson. Wilkinson argues that "perhaps [the journalists at the FOMC presser] need to imagine sitting down as the shrink prodding for his recent thoughts as the Fed chief overcomes his nerves in the psychiatrist’s chair." "If you think that way," he writes in a note to clients this morning, "perhaps you will find out what is really on the Chairman’s mind and what drives his decision-making process."
