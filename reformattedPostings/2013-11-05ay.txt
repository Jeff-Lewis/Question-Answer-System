Aviation photographer David Davis took this picture of a Cathay Pacific 747 after the plane experienced what pilots might describe as a "bird strike." Sometimes, as with the US Airways plane that was forced to land on the Hudson several years ago after a flock Canada geese flew into its engines, these strikes can cause catastrophic damage to the aircraft. In other cases, the damage is less severe — except to the bird(s). This 747 apparently hit a bird squarely on its nose cone. The plane survived. The bird presumably didn't. But it made quite a dent!
