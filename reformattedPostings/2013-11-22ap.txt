REUTERS/Jeff ZelevanskyCarl IcahnBillionaire investor Carl Icahn has fired more shots at his long-time rival Bill Ackman.  Here's what Uncle Carl told Bloomberg TV's Trish Regan earlier today:   "I fail to understand how Bill Ackman, whom I haven’t spoken to for years, nor do I intend to speak to, would know what I am or am not committed to. I continue to believe Herbalife has a great future, and in my opinion many of the things Ackman says about it are simply the rantings of a sore loser…Interestingly there is something that Ackman and I have in common. Ackman complained at an Oxford conference that every time I went on TV and mentioned Herbalife, the stock went up a few points. Well, that's also true of him." Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, was on Bloomberg TV earlier with Stephanie Ruhle talking about his Herbalife short.  He has lost about $500 million on his short so far.  Herbalife's stock rose more than 5% after Ackman gave another take-down presentation at the Robin Hood Investors Conference and made comments on air.  Icahn owns a massive long position in Herbalife.  During the last year, he has publicly called Ackman a "crybaby in the school yard" and said that he would be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes."
