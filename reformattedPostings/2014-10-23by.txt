AP ImagesYelp CEO and cofounder Jeremy Stoppelman.Yelp shares are tumbling in the wake of the company's Q3 earnings announcement. The stock is down 13% in early trading. The company reported that quarterly revenue jumped 67% to $102.5 million, which was a bit higher than the $99 million expected by analysts. Earnings came in at $0.05 cents per share, which was well ahead of the $0.02 expected. Management's guidance, however, was a bit light. The company expects Q4 revenue between $107 million and $108 million versus expectations for $111 million. "We had an outstanding quarter driven by strong execution across all areas of our business," CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said. While the pace of growth appears to be impressive, expectations for these young tech startups tend to be quite high. As such, it's very easy to disappoint investors. It is definitely worth pointing out that Yelp is up about 185% since its IPO three years ago. Google FinanceYelp Inc. FREE AppDownload
