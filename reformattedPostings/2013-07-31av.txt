via CNBCActivist investor Bob Chapman, who runs Manhattan Beach-based Chapman Capital, was on CNBC's "Halftime Report" with Scott Wapner moments ago talking about Herbalife and Bill Ackman. Chapman, who has been trading in and out of Herbalife for years, has a reputation for sending vitriolic letters to company boards. He has also had some choice words for Ackman in the past. "Making money when Bill Ackman is losing money is like a ride at the circus," he said during a telephone interview with CNBC. Chapman's price target today for Herbalife's stock is $75. However, he sees the stock going to $300. Chapman told Wapner that Herbalife constitutes one of the largest positions he holds in all of his accounts. In some of his accounts, it's over 50%, he said.  He reestablished his position in the nutrition supplement seller in the low $40s. As for Ackman's massive short, he says that he's not a guy who can surrender. "I truly believe that he has a poster of the movie "300" over his bed. He's not trained in the art of surrender." And then for Ackman's press release about Herbalife's earnings yesterday, he said "Oh these are good questions to be asking of JCPenney, not Herbalife." Ackman told CNBC earlier that he has not covered a single share. Back in December, Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square, publicly revealed that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of the stock. Since confirming his short, the stock has risen more than 41%. It's hitting 52-week highs today after it was reported that George Soros had amassed a sizeable long position. FREE AppDownload
