Flickr / ericmayAlmost two years ago I wrote The Future's so Bright .... In that post I outlined why I was becoming more optimistic.   Now that 2014 is the best year for employment since the '90s, it is time for an update! For new readers: I was very bearish on the economy when I started this blog in 2005 - back then I wrote mostly about housing (see: LA Times article and more here for comments about the blog). I started looking for the sun in early 2009, and now I'm more optimistic.Here are some updates to the graphs I posted two years ago.  Several of these graphs have changed direction since I wrote that post.  As example, state and local government employment is now increasing, and household deleveraging is over (as predicted).Calculated RiskThis graph shows total and single family housing starts. Even though starts have almost doubled from the bottom, starts are still way below the average level of 1.5 million per year from 1959 through 2000.  As of October, starts are still close to the bottom for previous recessions. Growth for starts in 2014 was slow, but that just means there is more growth ahead.  Demographics and household formation suggests starts will increase to around 1.5 million over the next few years. That means starts will probably increase another 50% or so from the October 2014 level of 1 million starts (SAAR).Residential investment and housing starts are usually the best leading indicator for the economy, so this suggests the economy will continue to grow over the next couple of years.Calculated Risk FREE AppDownload
