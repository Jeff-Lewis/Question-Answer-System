Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said, “We are extremely pleased to welcome a leader of Mr Howard’s calibre to the J.P. Morgan International Council. His unparallelled insight into Australia’s economic and business landscape, as well as his deep knowledge and extensive experience within the domestic and international political arena will be of immense value.” Howard said he was looking forward to “participating in thought leading dialogue around Australia’s business and economic agenda”.
