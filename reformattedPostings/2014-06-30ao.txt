COREAndrea Soros Colombel, daughter of billionaire investor George Soros, is putting up her Greenwich Village townhouse for $24.75 million. The luxurious property went on sale briefly in 2012 for $29.5 million, but was later withdrawn, The New York Times reports. She and her husband, Eric Colombel, first purchased the home for $11.5 million eight years ago. On top of the hefty new price tag, property taxes rack up to a little over $84,000 a year. With seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms, the townhouse is almost 8,500 square feet. Amenities include a private terrace, home gym with steam and sauna, three wood-burning fireplaces, an elevator, and more. The property is listed with CORE and is located at 10 West 10th Street, on Greenwich Village's Gold Coast.  FREE AppDownload
