However, the original year-on-year growth figure of 3% was revised down by 0.4 percentage points to 2.6%. That's not great because it means Britain's recovery has not been as strong as expected. The downward revision "is particularly disappointing as Britain has already been experiencing the slowest recovery in decades," The Guardian writes. It means that Britain's economy "is only 2.9% larger than before the financial crisis, not 3.4% as previously thought." Here's economist Shaun Richards' reaction on Twitter: Ouch! UK ONS: Between Q3 2013 and Q3 2014, #GDP in volume terms increased by 2.6%, revised downwards by 0.4% #NoXmasPresent The ONS said in statement: "The widening of the current account deficit was mainly due to a widening in the deficit on the primary income account from £8.2 billion in Quarter 2 2014 to £12.6 billion in Quarter 3 2014. This reflects receipts from foreign direct investment falling and payments to foreign direct investors rising. This was slightly offset by a narrowing in the deficit on the secondary income account."
