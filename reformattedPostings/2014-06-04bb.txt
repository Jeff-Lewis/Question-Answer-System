Societe GeneraleWall Street's strategists get paid tons of money to quibble over what stocks might do over the next year. But most investors have longer-term time horizons to consider. Today, the analysts at Societe Generale update their 10-year outlook for the global stock markets. In brief, they don't think investors should be anticipating the double-digit annual returns of the recent past. "US equities face three headwinds: cyclically-adjusted valuations (CAPE, starting date 1881) have returned to very expensive territory, corporate margins stand at historically high levels, and after already five years of growth from the 2009 trough, we estimate that the probability of another recession kicking in is close to 100% within the forecast timeframe (the longest cycle ever was 120 months, or 10 years)," they write. "But US equities have supports as well, such as impressively strong balance sheets and the beginning of a new M&amp;A cycle, backed by a highly reactive central bank." For the U.S., their baseline scenario assumes the S&amp;P 500 gets to 2,500 by 2024, which represents a meager 3% growth per year. "Our central scenario projects moderated underlying economic growth of 5% per year over the next few years, i.e. below the long-term growth trend (8.6%)," they elaborated. "We have also adopted a scenario whereby inflation will gradually increase at 1a00m0odest rate, until it pushes down the normalised 10-year moving P/E rate slightly, to below its long-term average of 20x." The 40-page report goes into a decent amount of depth and considers various scenarios. Their best-case and worst-case scenarios offer some interesting alternative glimpses into the future. As you can see, even in their best-case scenario, they only see single-digit annual gains. FREE AppDownload
