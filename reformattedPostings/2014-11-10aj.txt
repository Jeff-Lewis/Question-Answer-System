It's hard to get your foot in the door of Morgan Stanley, the bank that pulled in $8.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2014.  Landing a spot in its summer internship program is near impossible: 90,000 people applied to the gig this year, but only 1,000 were accepted, making for a 1.1% acceptance rate.  But if you do make it in, you're going to get paid.
