Dr. Ed's Blog The weakness in the price of crude oil in the face of all the turmoil in the Middle East is extraordinary. It certainly suggests that global economic growth remains subpar. Despite a sharp drop in Libyan output recently, OPEC production continues to hover between 36mbd and 38mbd. Non-OPEC output rose to a record 54.8mbd during July. Contributing to that record high is US oil field production, which is soaring and reached almost 9.0mbd in early September. The US is now exporting 3.7mbd of crude oil and petroleum products.Dr. Ed's Blog FREE AppDownload
