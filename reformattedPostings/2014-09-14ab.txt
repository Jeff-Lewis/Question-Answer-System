The Alternative for Germany (AfD), formed early last year, gained 10 percent in Thuringia state and 12 percent in Brandenburg, two weeks after also entering parliament in Saxony state, said exit polls by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF. ZDF also reported that in Thuringia the far-left Linke Party, successors East Germany's Communists, could potentially form a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats and Greens to unseat the ruling conservatives. The AfD, headed by economics professor Bernd Lucke, is an ascendant conservative party that only narrowly missed out on entering the national parliament last September and won seven seats in European Parliament elections in May. The party, which wants Germany to leave the euro and return to the Deutschmark, denies seeking right-wing voters, but flirts with populist ideas on issues such as law and order, immigration and traditional social values.   FREE AppDownload
