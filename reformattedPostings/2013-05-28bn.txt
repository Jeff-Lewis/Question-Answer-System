Business InsiderOn Saturday, I biked in the Xtreme Biker's Association's 14th annual "Xtreme Bike to the Shore" — a 78-mile charity ride from Philadelphia to Avalon, New Jersey. The Memorial Day weekend Saturday ride is popular among the financial services crowd, too. I met a bunch of cyclists from private equity firms, hedge funds, and investment banking.  There were a couple who could probably give Dan Loeb and Bill Ackman a run for their money on their bikes.  I've never been on a road bike in my life. I can't even remember the last time I was on a bike before this ride.   But the ride was for a great cause: It helped raise funds for Cristo Rey Philadelphia High School, a brand new, independent, Catholic college prep school for students of all faiths who cannot otherwise afford a private education. I've included highlights from my trip in the slides that follow, as well as some tips.   FREE AppDownload
