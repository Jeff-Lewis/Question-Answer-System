OneWire"Tiger Cub" hedge-fund manager Philippe Laffont, who runs Coatue Management, has decided to return $2 billion from its flagship fund to investors, CNBC's John Jannarone reports citing an investor letter. Last month was ugly for the long/short technology-focused fund. Coatue's flagship was down 9% because of losses in tech stocks, the report said.  Laffont characterized last month's market volatility as "sudden and deep as some of the gut-wrenching dislocations of 2000-2002 and 2008-2009." The fund's flagship fund has about $7 billion in assets under management. Laffont wrote that $5 billion in assets would be the right amount for the flagship, the report said. The $2 billion is expected to be returned to investors on June 30. Coatue invests in tech stocks such as Apple, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Netflix, Pandora and Yelp, the fund's most recent 13-F securities filing shows.  Laffont's hedge fund was seeded by legendary fund manager Julian Robertson of Tiger Management nearly 15 years ago. Coatue has recently been raising funds for a "hybrid fund" that will start investing hedge funds and private equity.  So if you look at the net, the total assets under management will be about the same.  FREE AppDownload
