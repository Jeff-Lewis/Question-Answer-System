Business InsiderTim Cook Apple just wrapped up one of its biggest events ever. It announced two new models of the iPhone — the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. It announced a new payment system for the iPhone called Apple Pay. It also announced a smart watch called the Apple Watch.  The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. The current iPhone 5S is a 4-inch model. Android phones for years have had larger screens, so Apple is catching up here. However, the phone looks great and is certain to be a blockbuster. Apple's payment system, Apple Pay looks pretty slick, too. If you have an iPhone 6, you will be able to simple tap your phone at a register, use your fingerprint and pay for things.  The Apple Watch is less certain. It looks a lot like an iPod slapped on your wrist. It can track your motion. It can do apps, and send messages.  Below are our notes on the event.  FREE AppDownload
