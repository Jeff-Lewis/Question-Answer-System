News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch filed for divorce from Wendi Deng today. There's no word on what the split could cost Murdoch, but the media mogul already has a history of costly divorce settlements. Murdoch separated from former wife Anna Torv in 1999, paying a reported $1.7 billion (including $110 million in cash), making it the most expensive divorce of all time. The pair had been married for 32 years. Murdoch married 30-year-old Deng just 17 days later. 82-year-old Murdoch is worth $11.2 billion, according to Forbes. FREE AppDownload
