via Sotheby'sThis beautiful Park City, Utah, log cabin belongs to the billionaire father of onetime presidential hopeful, Jon Huntsman. But Jon Huntsman Sr., founder of Huntsman Corp. and a major philanthropist, is having a tough time unloading the property, which first hit the market in 2009 with a $55 million asking price. He's now lowered the price on the 12-bedroom, 22,000-square-foot "chalet" to $34 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. "I went a little bit overboard when I built the thing, I have to admit," Huntsman told The WSJ. The home, which overlooks Deer Valley, is no ordinary log cabin. It sits on 60 acres of land and has an indoor pool, a dining room that seats 20, a fitness center, room for 28 cars, and a library. Meredith Galante contributed to this story. FREE AppDownload
