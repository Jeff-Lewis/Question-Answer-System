A blog called Computational Story Lab analyzed half a million of 2011's happiest tweets stemming from good times in Manhattan and pinpointed the happiest location on the island (h/t Curbed NYC). The precise location is around/in Central Park, near Central Park West and 77th Street. That's just north of the park's southern lake and east of the Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium. So if you had a really awesome time seeing a concert, sun bathing, feeding ducks, or learning about super novas and you tweeted it, you may have contributed to this little corner of Manhattan's win. The unscientific study also found that the West Side is slightly happier than the East Side and that people get gradually less happy as they move uptown.
