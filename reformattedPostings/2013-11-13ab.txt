Sotheby'sAn Andy Warhol work titled "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)" sold for a record $105.4 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City this evening. The sale was a record high price for the artist. The painting had been expected to sell for between $60 and $80 million. According to the AP: A prized 1963 Andy Warhol painting that captures the immediate aftermath of a car crash sold for $105 million Wednesday at a New York City auction, setting a record for the famed pop artist, Sotheby’s said. The 8- by 13-foot painting titled “Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)” depicts a twisted body sprawled across a car’s mangled interior. It has only been seen once in public in the past 26 years. The buyer wasn’t immediately identified. The previous record for a Warhol work was set in 2007 when “Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I)” sold for $71.7 million, according to the AP. The sale came just a day after a triptych by Francis Bacon sold for $142 million at Christie's, becoming the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction. FREE AppDownload
