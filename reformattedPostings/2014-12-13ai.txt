From JPMorgan, which some say could face a shortfall of $22 billion on account of the suggested regulation, to other major banks whose seemingly-adequate capital cushions would need to be revisited, analysts will be busy calculating what this could imply over time for earnings, capital raises and balance sheet management. As important as these factors are in influencing stock and bond valuations, investors would be well advised to take note of the broader message associated with this new proposal.  In opting for a surcharge that exceeds what is being called for by international regulatory initiatives, the Fed is exploiting the relative strength of the U.S. economy and its banking system to target greater financial soundness. It is proposing a phased-in implementation process that would start on January 1, 2016 and be fully effective by January 1, 2019. And to the extent that there could be an efficiency loss, this is considered a cost of nudging banks further away from excessive risk-taking and towards greater safety for them and for the system as a whole. If the Fed’s risk-based capital surcharge proposal is adopted, bank asset valuations would need to reflect over time this secular reality, including in the relative pricing of stocks versus and bonds. Herded by regulators who know that there is no appetite in society for another round of bank bailouts, the banking sector is now firmly on a multi-year path towards more of a “utility model;” and it is one that could well involve higher bond creditworthiness, more pressure on capital returns, and lowered (and less volatile) equity valuations.
