The consensus is for claims to increase to 345 thousand from 339 thousand last week.  • Also at 8:30 AM, the Trade Balance report for March from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for the U.S. trade deficit to decrease to $42.4 billion in March from $43.0 billion in February.  Also at 8:30 AM we get the ECB press conference, where Mario Draghi may announce new measures to supply credit to firms in the periphery.
