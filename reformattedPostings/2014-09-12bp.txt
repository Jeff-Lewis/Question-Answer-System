Bloomberg / Getty Images Expectations were for sales to climb 0.6% in August, up from flat sales in July. July's report was also revised up 0.3% from flat sales. Excluding auto sales, July's report was revised up to 0.3% from 0.1%.  Excluding car sales, retail sales rose 0.3%, in-line with expectations, and excluding autos and gas, sales gained 0.5%, which was also in-line with estimates.  In August, general merchandise sales, which includes department stores and wholesale clubs, fell 0.1%.  Following the report, Joe LaVorgna at Deutsche Bank said on Twitter: Aug #retailsales were meaningfully better after upward revisions to the past 2 months. The data are consistent with 3%-plus real #GDP growth Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said: "In one line: Solid, especially when revisions taken into account. August retail sales rose 0.6%, in line with the consensus. Sales ex-autos rose 0.3%, also matching expectations. But note the +0.5% revision to prior data, making the net report stronger than expected and lifting the y/y rate to 5.0% from 4.2% in July." These tables from the Census Bureau show the month-over-month and year-over-year change in retail sales. Census And this chart from Bill McBride at Calculated Risk shows the change in retail sales, ex-gas, over the past 20 years.  Calculated Risk In a note to clients ahead of the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: "The August retail sales numbers should surprise to the upside today, offsetting at least some of July's disappointment." He added: "All the indicators we look at, including auto sales and the chain store sales numbers, suggest that activity rebounded very strongly last month."  FREE AppDownload
