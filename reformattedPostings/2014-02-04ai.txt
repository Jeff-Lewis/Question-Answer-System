Bloomberg TVTom LeeJPMorgan chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee believes the weak start stocks have had this year presents a buying opportunity. In particular, Lee says companies with high sales exposure to emerging markets offer value after getting hit relatively hard in the sell-off that has taken its cue in part from EM. "Stocks with low EM exposure trade at 18.9x [earnings]," writes Lee in a note to clients. "This is 3.3 turns above those with high EM exposure. This 3.3x premium is well above the 10-year average of 1.6x and suggests that a contrarian stance would argue that high EM exposure may be the better risk/reward today." Lee suggests the following stocks for those who want to play this theme. They're all in cyclical sectors, their forward P/E ratio is less than 16x, they're all expected to deliver positive 2014 revenue growth, they're all overweight-rated buy JPM analysts, and they're all trading below JPM analysts' price targets: However, he also provides a word of caution, advising clients to pay attention to developments in the high-yield debt market. "In particular, if HY markets widen and reach 50 basis points, we would be more mindful of the risk for further downside. The reason is that typically a widening in HY presages either worsening liquidity and/or greater perceived risk—both undermine the case for stocks. We will continue to monitor this metric closely in coming weeks." FREE AppDownload
