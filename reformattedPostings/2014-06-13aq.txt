60 MinutesThe quiet market has made for a rough year for investors. Particularly for some of Wall Street's hedge-fund titans, a Wall Street Journal article said today.

Some failed strategies include investing heavily in the Japanese stock market (while the Nikkei Stock Average is down 7.1% since January), and underestimating U.S. bonds.  Hopefully things will turn around when the market shifts ... whenever that is.
