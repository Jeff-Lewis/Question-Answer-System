My hypothesis is that a new hierarchy is forming that blows away city/suburb distinctions over the long term.  If access and connectivity are becoming the key drivers for future development, places that have multiple modes available to them will be the winners and those without will be the losers.  Further, if the move away from auto use endures, places that have transit access will benefit more than those with highway access.  These could be the markers for communities in the Congealing Era.   Here's my crude, rude map showing how this might play out in the Chicago area (if any readers with GIS skills are willing to take this on, please e-mail me, and click to make big): Pete Saunders Here, green areas are those with rail and interstate access.  Darker yellow areas are those with rail access only. Lighter yellow areas are those with interstate access only, and those areas left blank have neither.  The dotted line represents roughly contiguous areas with rail and/or interstate access.  I see them as the beneficiaries of this trend.  Those on the outside of the dotted line may be faced with challenges in the new environment. A few observations: This article originally appeared at The Corner Side Yard.
