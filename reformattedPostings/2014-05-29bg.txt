The new service started over Memorial Day Weekend at Marquee Dayclub at The Cosmopolitan. In club co-owner Jason Strauss’ Instagram video of the event, party-goers parted as the drone flew a champagne bottle suspended in a bucket down towards the Dayclub’s pool. After a woman in a bikini grabbed the bottle, the drone flew away and everyone continued to rage.  “We are always trying to improve or [sic] delivery systems here at #TaoGroup,” Strauss said on his Instagram video. The service is available with a $20,000 minimum that guests must spend at the venue, and advance notice of at least a day. The steep price also includes a photo of the delivery and an aerial picture of the group, “perfect for social media posting,” according to a rep. It’s not the only champagne drone delivery service. Recently, ABC News reported that The Mansion at Casa Madrona’s in Sausalito, Calif. recently debuted a $10,000-per-night suite that includes a champagne drone delivery service that brings guests up to three bottles at a time.  We have a feeling we’ll be seeing this in the Hamptons shortly. FREE AppDownload
