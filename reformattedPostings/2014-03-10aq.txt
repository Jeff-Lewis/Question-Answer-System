There are at least four Bitcoin ATMs in operation at SXSW this year — one at a bar, one at a coffee shop, one at a gun certification school, and a final one that will be pretty much everywhere else as it rolls around on wheels: Robocoin Meet the Robocoin Rover, pictured in its trailer above. The trailer houses a Robocoin ATM that will enable SXSW-goers to turn cash into Bitcoin and vice-versa. (While Robocoin manufactures the devices, they are independently owned and operated. This particular one is managed by Coinvault ATM.) Robocoin Robocoin Robocoin  FREE AppDownload
