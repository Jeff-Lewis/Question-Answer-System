Courtesy of Melia RobinsonJillian D'Onfro and Melia RobinsonIt's graduation time, and everyone is sharing advice for graduates. So we decided to ask our co-workers at Business Insider, "What do you wish someone had told you at graduation?" From where you should try to get a job, to what you should drink, to how you should spend your money, our colleagues had a lot to say. But it's all valuable and comes right from the brains of people who have already experienced it. Enjoy, and good luck! FREE AppDownload
