Twitter ScreenshotThere really wasn't much reason for a Morgan Stanley broker to have a Twitter account until today. Large financial firms' employees are notoriously tight-lipped on social media, but fortunately Morgan Stanley is starting to loosen the reigns. Reuters reported on Monday that the company's brokers can now write and send their own tweets, following guidelines provided by the firm. Brokers must pass a 20 minute online training course and have at least 15 followers to qualify. All tweets still must be approved by Morgan Stanley, which the firm said should take several hours.  But anything will be an improvement from the scripted, generic blurbs they've been using.  Follow any group of Morgan Stanley advisors, and you'll soon see plenty of boring, neutral tweets repeatedly pop up on your feed. And not just about economics. Basically, if you've followed one, you've followed them all. A quick scroll through of the tweets also shows a severe lack of Twitter interaction. Which isn't surprising, given their robotic nature. Letting its advisors personalize their accounts might end up improving the company's social media presence. Overall, Morgan Stanley has a pretty engaged Twitter. A quick search showed far more identified Morgan Stanley advisors than any of its competitors. These topics seemed especially popular with the brokers. Beach vacations: Planning a beach vacation?
