Flickr/Ian SaneJust a quick reminder: This is going to be a huge week for the economy, everyone will be watching, and the festivities start later tonight. So enjoy your Sunday, and then get back to your computer to watch it all. We did a whole preview of this Saturday, but the gist is that Sunday night is the beginning of Global PMI Day, which is when each country reports manufacturing data. Then the rest of the week there's lots of data from the U.S. And because everyone is so focused on whether the Fed is going to tighten policy soon, the data takes on added importance. So come back Sunday evening, and follow Sam Ro covering the Asian data, and then in the early morning Monday for European coverage, followed by U.S. data tomorrow. FREE AppDownload
