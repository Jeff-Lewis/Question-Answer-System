The situation in Ukraine is not mentioned in the DoE's statement.  The test will include the "drawdown and sale of up to 5 million barrels of sour crude oil,” said DoE spokesman Bill Gibbons. Drawdowns on the SPR are pretty irregular. Here's a list from the DoE:   Oil is off more than 1.5% today. Earlier today, the EIA said weekly inventories were up 6.2 million barrels, far greater than the 2 million seen in a Tuesday survey conducted by Platts.  Oil has already had a rough week, down 3.5% on expectations of rising U.S. supplies amid reduced demand as refineries undergo seasonal maintenance. It closed at its lowest level in a month yesterday.

Due to the recent dramatic increase in domestic crude oil production, significant changes in the system have occurred - including pipeline expansion, construction of new infrastructure, reversed flow of existing pipelines and increased use of domestic crude oil terminals. In order to appropriately assess the system’s capabilities in the event of a disruption, today the Department of Energy authorized a test drawdown and sale of up to 5 million barrels of sour crude oil.” – DOE spokesman, Bill Gibbons BACKGROUND: FREE AppDownload
