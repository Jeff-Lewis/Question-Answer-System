The airlines' price fixing was first exposed seven years ago and triggered fines of 800 million euros in the European Union in 2010 and a fine of $1.5 billion in the United States. Victims of the cartel can sue separately for compensation. Deutsche Bahn said the companies targeted by the lawsuit in New York include Air France-KLM &lt;airf.pa&gt;, Scandinavia's SAS &lt;sas.st&gt;, Qantas Airways &lt;qan.ax&gt;, Cargolux Airlines International [CLUX.UL], Martinair Holland [MART.UL] and All Nippon Airways &lt;9202.T&gt;. Deutsche Bahn transports 390.1 million tons of freight a year, via land, rail, sea and air. It made 39.1 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in revenues last year and operates in more than 130 countries. A source familiar with the case said Deutsche Bahn's claim stood at more than $500 million. Deutsche Bahn declined to comment on the sum involved. The current lawsuit concerns airlines flying to and from the United States, as well as within the country.
