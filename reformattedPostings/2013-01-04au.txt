This is the Tricker's Valet Kit from British clothing store End. Why We Love It: You've got your wingtips, your loafers, your lace-ups, and your oxfords. But half the battle with men's formal shoes is keeping your leather shining and your shoes clean. For that, you need a valet kit. Tricker's has been hand-making bespoke footwear since 1829 in England, so they know a thing or two about men's shoes. The kit comes with four tins of polish, five jars of leather cream, a metal shoe horn, a buffing cloth, and a total of eight brushes for your collection. The polishes and creams are all high-grade, and come in a range of colors from neutral to jet black. The handsome black case measures 7.75'' x 14.5'' x 6''. End   End Where To Buy: Through U.K.-based store End. Cost: £350, or roughly $570. End does offer a 20% discount for non-EU customers, and price does not include shipping.
