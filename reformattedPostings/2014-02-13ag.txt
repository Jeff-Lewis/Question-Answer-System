David Moir/BravoPadma Lakshmi on "Top Chef," one of Bravo's top shows.Comcast announced plans to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45 billion today, which would produce an absolutely massive company if approved. In addition to being the largest cable provider in the U.S. with 23 million subscribers, Comcast owns a huge number of media and entertainment properties, especially since it completely acquired NBC Universal from GE in 2011. Time Warner Cable is the second-largest cable provider in the U.S. and has a few media properties, though since 2009 it has been distinct from the major media company Time Warner Inc.
