Had the report been released, the consensus forecast among market economists was for a slight increase in the trade deficit to $39.5 billion from July's $39.1 billion deficit. Luckily, regular economic data releases put out by the private sector also track trade metrics. Ambitious economy-watchers can also look at trade data from America's trading partners. Below are a few datapoints that give an idea of what the international trade picture looked like in August. Below is some commentary from the market economists: CIBC's Andrew Grantham: "We don’t expect much divergence in the volume of exports and imports for August, with both on modestly improving trends. That should leave relative prices as the main determinant of the trade deficit. Import prices were flat on the month, while export prices fell. The result should be a modest widening of the trade deficit to $40.2 bn." FREE AppDownload
