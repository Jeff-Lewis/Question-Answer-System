NBCA startling tweet from the Associated Press just now: BREAKING: Father of Boston bombing suspect says son is accomplished medical student and 'a true angel'. The AP called the brothers' father in Russia. Here are more details from AP's story: Anzor Tsarnaev spoke with The Associated Press by telephone from the Russian city of Makhachkala on Friday after police said one of his sons, 26-year-old Tamerlan, had been killed in a shootout and the other, Dzhokhar, was being intensely pursued. "My son is a true angel," the elder Tsarnaev said. "Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here." The suspects' uncle, interviewed by CNN, was considerably less charitable. He said the suspects "do not deserve to live on this earth." The Today Show has also interviewed high-school classmates of the younger brother, Dzhokhar, who say he was well-liked, friendly, and "sweet"--not the disgruntled loner type that is commonly associated with massacres like this. Another high-school classmate said she was "shocked" to learn that he was one of the suspects. A host of a Public Radio International radio show, Robin Young, tweeted the following photograph of her nephew with Dzhokhar at a high-school prom.
