The price of Bitcoin is now within a stone's throw of the price of gold. The digital currency already set a record earlier today on the Mt. Gox exchange, touching $1,242 (it's since come back down to $1,162). Meanwhile, gold is at $1,250 an ounce. At this point, the unending surge in Bitcoin prices appears to be riding a wave of speculative momentum. The price of a March Bitcoin future on Swedish-based ICBIT.se (though on admittedly thin volume) is more than $1,700.  Here's a helpful chart, from Bespoke Investment Group: Bespoke Investment Group We'll update this as soon as the cross actually occurs.
