McKessonLast night, Alcoa kicked off second quarter earnings season with a beat.  Over the next several weeks, earnings reports will roll in with 72% of the S&amp;P 500 set to announce quarterly results over a three-week period beginning July 14.  In a note to clients ahead of earnings, Goldman Sachs' Amanda Sneider highlights 22 companies the firm expects to beat expectations. Many of the expected beats are just by a penny or three, but there are a few companies Sneider expects to soundly beat street estimates.  Goldman sees healthcare giant McKesson reporting a profit of $2.65 per share against Wall Street's current expectations for $2.36. In the energy sector, Goldman also sees a number of companies beating expectations, notably CONSOL Energy, which the firm expects to report earnings per share of $0.37 against Street estimates for $0.26.  By sector, Goldman sees the most earnings beats coming from the Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Financial, and Energy sectors.  Here's the full table.  Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
