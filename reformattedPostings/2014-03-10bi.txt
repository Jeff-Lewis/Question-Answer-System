Dave Carlson is running one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations there is. He's set up an army of number-crunching computers in two warehouses at an undisclosed location in Washington State. The computers generate a ton of heat and burn through electricity, but Carlson says he's generating $8 million worth of Bitcoin per month! He invited KOMO News, a local Seattle station, to come check it out.
