To create this, we combined five notable rankings from food experts and New York publications, including Zagat, the Village Voice, Eater, Time Out New York, and Gothamist. We gave each restaurant a numerical ranking based on how many lists it appeared on and how high it appeared on the ranked lists. We only included restaurants that made at least two lists.  FREE AppDownload
