Yesterday we told you which states have the biggest problems with which drugs. What about for the country as a whole? Via the DEA, here is the evolution of drug seizures between 1986 and 2012. The figures can be largely taken as a proxy for which drugs were most popular when. But they're also a reflection of laws and economics. As a result, you'll notice that seizures of some drugs have come down significantly thanks since the Great Recession, as well as the dialing back of the war on drugs under the Obama administration. Meanwhile, cheaper drugs have seen their popularity climb.
