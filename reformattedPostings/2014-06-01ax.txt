Jay YarowApple is typically a tight-lipped company when it comes to future products. But, with people getting antsy for the next big thing, its executives have become uncharacteristically talkative about what it's planning.  Naturally, they're not explicitly saying what they've got coming, but they're hyping what's in development.  "Later this year, we've got the best product pipeline that I've seen in my 25 years at Apple," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and service, said last week at the Code Conference. "I believe the products we've got coming are great." In February CEO Tim Cook said, "There will be new categories. We're not ready to talk about it, but we're working on some really great stuff." Remember, Apple released the iPhone and the iPad in the past 25 years that Cue is referring to. Whatever it has in development is supposedly going to be better than those products. So the pressure is now on for Apple to deliver.  Apple kicks off its year of exciting new products on Monday, June 2, in San Francisco at WWDC, its annual developer conference. At 10 a.m. local time, it will have a keynote to preview new software for the Mac and the iPhone. It's also going to have some sort of new hardware, but don't expect anything like the iWatch.  Here is what everyone is expecting: This will set up Apple for the rest of the year. In the coming months Apple will likely launch a bigger-screen iPhone, new iPads, and possibly the rumored iWatch. Mark this as the beginning of the next big Apple era.  FREE AppDownload
