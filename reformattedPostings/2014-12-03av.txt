REUTERS/ Sebastien NogierBlackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien.At the beginning of 2014, Blackstone Group Vice Chairman Byron Wien released his 10 surprise predictions for the markets and the economy.  Wien is a legend on Wall Street, and his predictions are widely read and circulated at the beginning of the year. But with 2014 winding down and people starting to look ahead to what 2015 holds, it is only right that we take a look back and see how Wien did this year.  Wien calls his predictions "surprise" predictions that the average investor would only assign a one-in-three chance of happening. And following form, Wien got some of these calls really right, some of them really wrong, and only a few anywhere in-between. We scored Wien's predictions simply: Zero points for wrong predictions, one point for correct predictions, and one-half point for predictions that were right down the middle.  FREE AppDownload
