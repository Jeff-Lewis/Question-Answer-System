The union wants to put pressure on Lufthansa to maintain an early retirement scheme that allows pilots to retire at 55 and still keep some of their pay until they reach the age at which state pension payments start. Lufthansa and VC are due to return to the negotiating table later on Thursday. VC said in its statement that it would call off the strike at Germanwings on Friday if the talks led to an agreement.   (Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Matt Driskill) FREE AppDownload
