The geographic distribution of income and wealth in the U.S. is always a fascinating topic.  One of the many types of geography the Census Bureau tabulates figures for are "places." These are either legally incorporated cities or towns or Census-designated statistical equivalents. In this map, we consider places with at least 1,000 residents, according to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey. Using income estimates from the ACS, we found the place with the highest median household income in each state. The map shows where the affluent towns are, and the median income in each: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey Many of the affluent communities are wealthy suburbs of major cities such as Scarsdale, New York, and Darien, Connecticut, outside of New York City, and Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Great Falls, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. They all tend to be fairly small with populations ranging from about 1,000 (our chosen lower cutoff) to about 18,000. Here's a table with the 50 towns and their median incomes: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey
