 Michael Dell is strolling around the conference center in Davos today--looking quite sharp, as usual. So are Steve Schwarzman and a number of other private-equity moguls, including some who may or may not be involved in the hot-and-heavy talks to take Dell private. Michael Dell and the private-equity moguls, of course, won't discuss the ongoing talks, even in the corridors at Davos. But here are some questions that Michael Dell, especially, should be encouraged to answer: We can, of course, speculate about what Michael Dell and his private-equity partners will do when they take Dell private: That's standard private-equity operating procedure. Sometimes, if it's done well, it actually improves companies, in addition to making the private-equity moguls rich. Sometimes, if it's done badly, it guts companies and overloads them with debt, so that they collapse within a year or two of being sold back to the public markets. There's nothing wrong with the good part of that.

What's stopping him? SEE ALSO: The Truth About Davos FREE AppDownload
