DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TexasUBS is out with its annual Global Oil &amp; Gas Analyser report, which goes into great depth about world's largest exploration and production companies. Lately, everyone's been talking about how the U.S. has now become 'Saudi America.' And the UBS team, led by Jon Rigby, says America's shale boom is nowhere close to running out. North American shale production will continue to dominate non-OPEC output, with the U.S. alone contributing half the average annual output growth in the coming years alone. By 2020, the U.S. becomes the world's largest oil producer. On shale gas, "the US in particular enjoys a combination of factors – the scale of the resource, the scale and depth of the market, the scale and depth of the infrastructure and the oil service industry and the particular legal and regulatory conditions that are not exactly replicated anywhere else." UBS's analysts sees an average 8% upside for the energy exploration and production companies it covers. Here, we highlight the 14 North American-based firms that offer positive returns.
