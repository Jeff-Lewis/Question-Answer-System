Payouts in fiscal year 2014, which ended Sept. 30, also include hundreds of millions of dollars in fines levied on UBS AG  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc . "It shows the fruits of the Justice Department’s tireless work in enforcing federal laws ... and in holding financial institutions accountable for their roles in causing the 2008 financial crisis,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in announcing the total collections.     (Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Chris Reese) FREE AppDownload
