Banana RepublicA month ago, we asked you to vote for the best places for guys to shop.  The results are in, and we're ready to reveal where men like to get their apparel and accessories.  Nearly 1,000 Business Insider readers took the survey. Not surprisingly, 97% of the respondents were men, most of whom are city dwellers in their twenties. Preferences were split between department stores (35%), online retailers (34%), and independent retailers (30%), but it's clear that these guys have some strong opinions about the best places to shop.  We have winners for categories including suits, dress shirts, sunglasses, and more.  Thanks for voting!  FREE AppDownload
