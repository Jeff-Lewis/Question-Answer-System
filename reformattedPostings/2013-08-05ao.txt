Buffet recalled making a sketch with "Breaking Bad" actors Cranston and Aaron Paul to be shown at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting this year and referred to Albuquerque's drug kingpin as "a great businessman," saying "he’s my guy if I ever have to go toe-to-toe with anyone." We're not sure how closely Buffett pays attention to the show, but the proclaimed "great businessman" has personally killed at least two dozen men, poisoned a small child, lied his way to the top of the meth business, and is currently on the run under an alias. Remember Walt's previous business partner Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) once referred to the same guy as a ticking time bomb.  FREE AppDownload
