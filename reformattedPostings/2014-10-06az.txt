CFO Sharon McCollam recently told Goldman Sachs that the TVs would "be a decisive product for the franchise."  The TV's picture is four times more detailed than standard high definition, according to Best Buy's website.  The TVs also include internet access for easy television, movie, and music streaming.  Best Buy is working with the manufacturers Sony and Samsung to showcase all the TVs' features in stores, McCollam said.  Sony on InstagramBest Buy tells Goldman Sachs that the high-tech TVs are a "decisive product" for the industry. Because the televisions currently cost $4,000 to $10,000, they are not popular enough to affect business, McCollam said. Prices are expected to decline in the next couple of years.  Best Buy's store traffic has been declining as more people buy online.  In a report last week, Goldman Sachs said that people prefer to buy large, heavy objects online because they are difficult to ship.
