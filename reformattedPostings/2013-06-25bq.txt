Reuters/Joshua LottNew home sales beat expectations rising 2.1% month-over-month in May, to an annual rate of 476,000. Economists polled by Bloomberg were looking for new home sales to rise 1.3% on the month to an annualized rate of 460,000. April's number was revised up to show a 3.3% rise to 466,000, from the initial reading of  a 2.3% month-over-month rise to 454,000. The median sales price of new homes in May was $263,900. In terms of supply, seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale was 161,000. This represents a supply of 4.1 months at the current sales rate. Economists watch the new home sales number to get an insight into housing supply, because tight supply helps support home prices. It also reflects the health of the American consumer. Last week we saw May existing home sales rise 12.9% on the year to an annualized rate of 5.18 million. But housing supply fell to 5.1 months supply at current sales pace. Earlier today we saw S&amp;P Case-Shiller home prices climbed 12.05% beating expectations, and the FHFA home price index rise 0.7%, below expectations for a 1.1% rise. Some economists expect home prices to cool by the end of the year and we will closely track this data for clues on where home prices will go. FREE AppDownload
