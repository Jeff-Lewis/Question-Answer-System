Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.98 billion, essentially unchanged compared with 2012. Net revenues in Underwriting were $4.03 billion, 36% higher than 2012, due to strong net revenues in both equity and debt underwriting. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly higher compared with 2012, reflecting an increase in client activity, particularly in initial public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher compared with 2012, principally due to leveraged finance activity. Fourth QuarterNet revenues in Investment Banking were $1.72 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, 22% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 47% higher than the third quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $585 million, 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. Net revenues in Underwriting were $1.13 billion, 26% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, due to strong net revenues in equity underwriting. Net revenues in equity underwriting were more than double the amount in the fourth quarter of 2012, reflecting an increase in client activity, particularly in initial public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with a strong fourth quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting lower net revenues from investment-grade activity. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter of 2013 and increased significantly compared with the end of 2012. (9) Institutional Client Services Full YearNet revenues in Institutional Client Services were $15.72 billion for 2013, 13% lower than 2012. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $8.65 billion for 2013, 13% lower than 2012, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products compared with a solid 2012, and significantly lower net revenues in mortgages compared with a strong 2012. In addition, net revenues in currencies were slightly lower, while net revenues in credit products and commodities were essentially unchanged compared with 2012. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a generally challenging environment during much of 2013, as macroeconomic concerns and uncertainty led to challenging market-making conditions and generally lower levels of activity. Net revenues in Equities were $7.07 billion for 2013, 14% lower compared with 2012, due to the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business (10) in 2013 and the sale of the firm’s hedge fund administration business in 2012. Net revenues in equities client execution (excluding net revenues from the firm’s Americas reinsurance business) were higher compared with 2012, including significantly higher net revenues in cash products, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in derivatives. Commissions and fees were slightly higher compared with 2012. Securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with 2012, primarily due to the sale of the firm’s hedge fund administration business in 2012. During 2013, Equities operated in an environment characterized by a significant increase in global equity prices, particularly in Japan and the U.S., and generally lower volatility levels. The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm's own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $296 million ($220 million and $76 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2013, compared with a net loss of $714 million ($433 million and $281 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2012. Fourth QuarterNet revenues in Institutional Client Services were $3.41 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 19% higher than the third quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.72 billion, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2012, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and, to a lesser extent, interest rate products, currencies and commodities. Net revenues in credit products, which include a gain on the sale of the firm’s European insurance business, were higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and improved market-making conditions in certain businesses, compared with the third quarter of 2013. However, economic uncertainty persisted and levels of activity generally remained low. Net revenues in Equities were $1.68 billion, 27% lower than the fourth quarter of 2012, due to the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business (10) in 2013 and the sale of the firm’s hedge fund administration business in 2012. Net revenues in equities client execution (excluding net revenues from the firm’s Americas reinsurance business) were significantly higher compared with the same prior year period, including significantly higher net revenues in cash products, partially offset by lower net revenues in derivatives. Commissions and fees were slightly higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, due to a gain of $494 million on the sale of the firm’s hedge fund administration business in 2012. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices, while volatility levels remained low. The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm's own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $206 million ($163 million and $43 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with a net loss of $126 million ($79 million and $47 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the fourth quarter of 2012.

During the year, total assets under supervision (3) increased $77 billion to $1.04 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision (3)increased $81 billion, including net inflows of $41 billion (4), reflecting inflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by outflows in alternative investment assets. Net market appreciation of $40 billion during the year was primarily in equity assets. Liquidity products (3) decreased $4 billion. Fourth QuarterNet revenues in Investment Management were $1.60 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, 5% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 31% higher than the third quarter of 2013. The increase in net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 reflected higher management and other fees, primarily due to higher average assets under supervision. During the quarter, total assets under supervision (3) increased $51 billion to $1.04 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision (3) increased $33 billion, including net inflows of $13 billion, reflecting inflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by outflows in alternative investment assets. Net market appreciation of $20 billion during the quarter was primarily in equity assets. In addition, liquidity products (3) increased $18 billion. Expenses Operating expenses were $22.47 billion for 2013, 2% lower than 2012. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) were $12.61 billion for 2013, 3% lower than 2012. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2013 was 36.9% compared with 37.9% for 2012. Total staff (11) increased 2% compared with the end of 2012. Non-Compensation Expenses Full YearNon-compensation expenses were $9.86 billion for 2013, 2% lower than 2012. The decrease compared with 2012 included a decline in insurance reserves, reflecting the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business, and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower impairments and lower operating expenses related to consolidated investments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other expenses, due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2013 were $962 million compared with $448 million for 2012. Fourth QuarterNon-compensation expenses were $3.04 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 40% higher than the third quarter of 2013. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 included an increase in other expenses, due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, partially offset by lower operating expenses related to consolidated investments. This increase was partially offset by a decline in insurance reserves, reflecting the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $561 million (primarily comprised of net provisions for mortgage-related matters) compared with $260 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 (including the settlement with the Federal Reserve Board regarding the independent foreclosure review). The fourth quarter of 2013 also included $196 million of impairment charges, principally related to consolidated investments, and a $155 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2013 was 31.5%, up from 30.3% for the first nine months of 2013, reflecting a decrease in the impact of permanent benefits. The rate decreased from 33.3% for 2012 to 31.5% for 2013, primarily due to a determination that certain non-U.S. earnings will be permanently reinvested abroad. Capital As of December 31, 2013, total capital was $239.44 billion, consisting of $78.47 billion in total shareholders’ equity (common shareholders’ equity of $71.27 billion and preferred stock of $7.20 billion) and $160.97 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. In October 2013, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries exercised in full the warrant to purchase shares of the firm’s common stock, which required net share settlement and resulted in a reduction of approximately 3% to both book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. Including the impact of the warrant exercise, book value per common share increased approximately 5% to $152.48 and tangible book value per common share (5)increased approximately 7% to $143.11 compared with the end of 2012, while both decreased approximately 1% compared with the end of the third quarter of 2013. Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 467.4 million as of December 31, 2013. During the year, the firm repurchased 39.3 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $157.11, for a total cost of $6.17 billion, including 8.5 million shares during the fourth quarter at an average cost per share of $164.90, for a total cost of $1.40 billion. The remaining share authorization under the firm’s existing repurchase program is 57.2 million shares. (12) Under the regulatory capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies in 2013, the firm’s Tier 1 capital ratio (6) was 16.7% (7) and the firm’s Tier 1 common ratio (6) was 14.6% (7) as of December 31, 2013, up from 16.3% and 14.2%, respectively, as of September 30, 2013 (in each case under Basel I and also reflecting the revised market risk regulatory capital requirements which became effective on January 1, 2013).
