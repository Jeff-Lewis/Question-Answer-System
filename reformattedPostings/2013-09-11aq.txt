Treasuries are surging following a well-supported government auction of $21 billion of 10-year notes at 1 PM ET. The auction "stopped through," meaning the highest yield of bonds issued in the auction (2.946%) was below the "when-issued" yield heading into the auction (2.970%). The bid-to-cover ratio – the dollar amount of bids for the bonds versus the actual dollar amount issued – was 2.86, a sharp increase from 2.45 in the government's previous auction of 10-year notes. Earlier today, Verizon priced the largest corporate bond offering ever, selling $49 billion in debt to help finance its recent acquisition of Vodafone's wireless assets. Traders say market participants engaged in "rate locking," which involves shorting Treasuries to hedge against a rise in rates that could adversely affect the pricing of the Verizon deal. An unwind of that short-Treasuries trade could be responsible for the big lift from today's 10-year auction, as a few traders on suggest on Twitter. Looks like a rate unlock into the auction. It comes 2bps thru strong 10yr auction...comes thru 1.6 bps (all those peeps who sold into the VZ deal pricing scrambling to cover) The chart below shows the move in 10-year Treasury futures post-auction.
