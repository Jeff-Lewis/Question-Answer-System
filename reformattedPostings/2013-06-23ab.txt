REUTERS/Larry Downing Last week was crazy. Treasuries tumbled sending the 10-year yield above 2.5% for the first time since April 2011.  Gold crashed below $1,300, hitting its lowest levels since September 2010. And the S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 1,592, down 5.6% from its high of the year. Market volatility has been elevated ever since Wednesday when Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke suggested that the Fed could begin to taper, or scale back, its stimulative monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of bonds "later this year." "Expect further market volatility and liquidity dislocations in the immediate period ahead," said PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian. "[M]arkets and the Fed are now even more highly dependent on sustained evidence that the real economy is indeed on a solid improving trends, including a consequential rise in actual and expected nominal GDP growth." This week, eight Federal Reserve officials will be speaking as at least ten critical economic reports come out. Buckle up.

"Factors such as tapering, international economic disappointments and challenges for a quicker anticipated equity market leadership shift into global cyclicals suggest that the environment may not be that conducive for a new rally effort quite yet." Levkovich currently expects the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 1,615. FREE AppDownload
