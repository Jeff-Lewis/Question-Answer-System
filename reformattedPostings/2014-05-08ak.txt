TPM/YouTubeFox News didn't have to look far for public outrage over a porn-loving EPA employee. Geraldo Rivera deployed his camera crew this week to a midtown Manhattan diner to get reactions from everyday Americans about an EPA official who watched porn at work but who remains at the agency. The diner is a place "where you do get a great cross-section of people living in the New York metropolitan area," Rivera said. But among those everyday people were a couple of folks who might have been recognizable to Fox's most loyal viewers: Fox Business hosts Charlie Gasparino and Lori Rothman. The pair wasn't identified on screen by their names or titles, though, giving the impression that they were just two commoners having a meal. "Here's the problem," Gasparino said. "You can't get away with that in private industry. There's just no way, you know what I'm saying? Government allows you to get away with it because essentially there's no one watching the store." Rothman agreed. "It's wrong," she said. "It does create a hostile work environment and if anybody should be walking by and kind of look over the shoulder to see what's going on, it's absolutely harassment." If you don't count yourself among Fox Business's tiny audience, you may not have recognized either Gasparino or Rothman. It wasn't until after Rivera showed the footage on Thursday afternoon that Gretchen Carlson identified the pair as fellow Fox dwellers. "Somehow Charlie Gasparino and Lori Rothman from Fox Business Network — " Carlson said before being cut off by Rivera. "Well, we snagged a lot of them," Rivera said. "They're right next door."
