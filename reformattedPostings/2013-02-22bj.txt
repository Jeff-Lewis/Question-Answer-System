Bloomberg via YouTubeTom LeeJPMorgan's Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Tom Lee says it's time to move to the sidelines following the biggest sell-off in the stock market this year that has taken place over the past two days. Lee is known as typically bullish on equities – and he remains positive over a longer time frame – but for now, he tells clients in a note, "it is challenging to see the elements to support a big lift in equity prices from these levels. Thus, we recommend investors turn cautious and defer incremental purchases." In the note – titled "Stepping Aside Short-Term; Fade Strength and Look for Better Entry Point Around 1400-1450; Big Picture Constructive" – Lee gives three reasons why now is the time: On the other hand, Lee warns, "Equities are likely to rebound in coming days given two heavy days of selling and it is possible equities could rebound without a deeper pullback with M&amp;A and performance anxiety being the drivers (managers buy this dip and reverse recent losses)." Lee expanded on this idea – that there could be no correction – in his last note. To read more about that, click here &gt; FREE AppDownload
