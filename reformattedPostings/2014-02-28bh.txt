HeyRocker/flickrInternships are essential today. They’re the best way to gain experience, develop a professional network, and get your foot in the door — which is why so many interns are willing to work for free.  But some don’t have to. And the very lucky ones will watch their bank accounts grow enormously this summer. Glassdoor.com, a jobs and career community where people share information and opinions about their workplaces, compiled a list of the 25 highest-paying internships, based on at least 20 intern salary reports for each company. They found that paid internships typically offer between $15 and $19 an hour, or $2,400 to $3,100 a month, on average. But companies like Twitter, ExxonMobil, and BlackRock pay double that — and Palantir Technologies, a Palo Alto-based software firm, pays nearly triple the monthly average, making it the highest-paying company for interns in 2014. Palantir Technologies landed the top spot with an average monthly base salary of $7,012, out-ranking tech giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Apple. But it's not all about money. A support engineer intern at the company said: “[The] work is motivated by a real mission. Very few people are there just for money.” Here are the 25 highest-paying companies for interns: 1.
