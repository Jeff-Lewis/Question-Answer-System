APIn a speech that was both solemn and uplifting, President Barack Obama delivered a terse warning to the "small, stunted individuals" responsible for Monday's bombings at the Boston Marathon.  "Yes, we will find you. And yes, you will face justice," Obama said, speaking at an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. Obama's speech, which came just three days after the attacks, took an at-times personal tone. He hailed Boston as a great American city, fondly recalling how the city welcomed him as a Harvard law student, and he told those responsible that they "picked the wrong city" to attack. "This town is not just a capital — not just a place. Boston is the perfect state of grace," Obama began, citing a famous poem by E.B. White. "Boston's your hometown, but we claim it a little bit, too," he said. "I know this because there's a little piece of Boston in me." "Boston," he said, "you're my home." Obama declared that the city would rebound from the bombings, and he said "you can bet" the 118th Boston Marathon will be run next year on Patriot's Day. "We may be momentarily knocked off our feet, but we'll pick ourselves up. We'll keep going. We'll finish the race," Obama said. Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney also attended the interfaith service, along with various Massachusetts members of Congress who made the trip with Obama. First Lady Michelle Obama also attended the service. A number of speakers delivered remarks before Obama.  "We will not to overcome by evil — but combat evil with good," Cardinal Sean O'Malley said. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said he "never loved Boston more than I do today." FREE AppDownload
