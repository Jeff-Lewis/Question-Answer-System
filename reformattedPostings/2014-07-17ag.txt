The volatility index, or VIX, gained 32% today. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," measures expected volatility in the S&amp;P 500 over the next month.  Amid the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in Ukraine and late afternoon reports that Israel has begun a ground operation in Gaza, stocks sold off as "safe haven" assets like gold and bonds rallied. Gold was trading near $1320 an ounce, up from about $1305 early in the day, while the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 2.44% from 2.51% earlier.  The VIX, which has been at historically low levels through the spring, traded up to 15.00 — or an advance of more than 37% — at one point during the session before settling at 14.54.
