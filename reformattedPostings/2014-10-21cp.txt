"All that we have done, and all that we will do, is informed by his values and his spirit. Through Oscar's example we know the way forward. We will make Oscar very proud of us by continuing in an even stronger way the work that Oscar loved so much."  REUTERS/Mike Segar Designer Oscar de la Renta and Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue in 2005. The designer, born in the Dominican Republic, defined American style  in the '60s and '70s. The New York Times writes: "Determined to stay relevant, Mr. de la Renta achieved fame in two distinct realms: as a couturier to socialites — the so-called ladies-who-lunch, his bread and butter — and as a red-carpet king. He also dressed four American first ladies, but it was Hollywood glitz, rather than nice uptown clothes, that defined him for a new age and a new customer. Just as astutely he embraced social media."
