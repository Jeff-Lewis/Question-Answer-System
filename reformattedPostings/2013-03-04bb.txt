Ever since the stock market rally began, there have been two schools of thought explaining this rally.  One school believes that the rally has been driven by improving fundamentals like rising corporate profits and an improving global economy.  The other more skeptical school believes that it has been driven by a dovish global central banks that have been pumping money into the financial markets. In a report published late last month, Morgan Stanley's Gerard Minack tackled the issue by offering two charts that sum up the entire debate The first chart correlates the stock market with the Fed's expanding balance sheet: Morgan Stanley The second correlates stock market valuations with economic surprises. Morgan Stanley Minack doesn't buy the argument that the Fed alone is driving markets.  He offers four reasons, which we summarize here: To borrow from UBS's Art Cashin, it seems the Occam's Razor-type explanation that markets have been driven by fundamentals is more likely. It's worth noting, however, that the two schools of thought don't have to be mutually exclusive.  Reformed Broker Josh Brown argues earnings are up because of the Fed's easy monetary policy: Because the Fed is not driving the stock market - it is driving the fundamentals that are driving the stock market. Once you make this distinction, it frees you up from a lot of the nonsense and conspiratorial scuttlebutt that passes for market commentary these days. The Fed's ZIRP policy is the most important driver of US earnings growth right now in my estimation which is what's behind the rally in share prices. Perhaps both schools are right.
