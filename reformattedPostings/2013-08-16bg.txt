Reuters/Chris KeaneHousing starts missed expectations rising 5.9% to an annualized rate of 896,00 units in July. This missed expectations for a 7.7% rise to an annualized rate of 900,000 units. June numbers were revised up to show a 7.9% fall to 846,000. Meanwhile, building permits also came in shy of expectations rising 2.7% to 943,000. This was below expectations for a 2.9% to 945,000. June's number was also revised up to show a 6.8% fall to 918,000. The run up in homebuilder confidence should point to stronger housing starts, but Paul Diggle at Capital Economics has previously argued that NAHB has a "history of over-exuberance as a predictor of starts."
