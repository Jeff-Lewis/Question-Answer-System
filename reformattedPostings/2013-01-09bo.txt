Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderClockwise, starting at left: Dylan Love, Jay Yarow, Abby Rogers, and Erin Fuchs.A couple of years ago, I revealed a lot of internal information about Business Insider--the sort of information that most companies paranoically guard for a litany of stated reasons. I said that, if nothing horrible happened, I might one day do the same thing again. Well, nothing horrible happened. (At least nothing I'm aware of.) So, when FOLIO called and asked if I would be willing to share the Business Insider story in a keynote presentation at its MediaNext conference, I figured I might as well open the kimono again. (FOLIO, after all, was kind enough to title my session: BUSINESS INSIDER: From Upstart To Powerhouse. How could I refuse a request like that?) So, I gave the presentation this morning. I included a whole bunch of previously secret information. And on the theory that other folks might be interested--namely you, our readers, who make all of our success possible--I've published the presentation here. There are a lot of slides, but few words, so it should be an easy flip-through. Here are some of the secrets I revealed: Thank you again for reading Business Insider and for helping to make our success possible. We listen closely to what you tell us, and we will keep striving to make the site better every day.
