Mission accomplished. We are now concerned that investor momentum has swung too far in the other direction. Recent developments include: John Burns Real Estate Consulting While the permabears or big name economists (who are lucky to have a staff of one focused on housing) went on TV claiming that rising mortgage rates would cause another downturn, and Wall Street responded by selling all things housing, we went public on June 3 and June 26 saying that rising rates were necessary to prevent another bubble. Since investors remain as optimistic as ever, rising rates do not appear to be cooling the market much at all. At this pace, the Fed will soon accomplish their unstated goal of eliminating negative equity, which will allow for refinancing that will be great for the economy. However, I don't know what will shut off the investors other than another crisis or recession. I am reminded of the Housing Cycles History video we did in March 2008, when the housing market was falling apart, but the economy was still growing. There are some valuable lessons in here worth revisiting, including the Fed's historical role. As for now, the fundamentals still look strong.
