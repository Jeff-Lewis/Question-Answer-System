Michael SetoHenry Blodget, Jim Bankoff & Lockhart SteeleWe're thrilled to announce December 1-3 as the dates for IGNITION: Future of Digital. Business Insider’s flagship event is in its fifth year running and is moving to a new venue, The Times Center in New York. We'll have an opening kick-off in the afternoon of the 1st, followed by two days of jam-packed sessions on Dec. 2-3. IGNITION brings together 700 senior executives from the converging worlds of media, technology, marketing, and investing.  Their mission will be to explore the ongoing explosion of new business models being fueled by digital technology and the Internet. IGNITION attracts speakers like Elon Musk, Travis Kalanick, Sheryl Sandberg, Jeff Weiner, Fred Wilson, Jeff Bewkes, Andrew Mason, Shane Smith, Arianna Huffington, Jason Kilar, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Nick Denton, and many more — along with emerging startups who discuss and demo disruptive technologies. Now that you have the date, don't delay! Extra-early-bird tickets are available here and will save you half off the ticket price.
