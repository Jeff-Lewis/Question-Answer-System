A fresh measure of investor sentiment from Sentix shows confidence in the eurozone plunging sharply because of the sanctions being imposed on Russia. From Reuters: The Sentix research group's index tracking morale among investors in the eurozone slumped to 2.7 in August, its lowest level in a year, from 10.1 in July.

"After last month's recovery the eurozone Sentix index has suffered a painful setback," Sentix said in a statement, attributing it to sharply reduced growth expectations because of the sanctions. "As this slump derives from an event which is subject to politics and power play, the central banks, particularly the European Central Bank, will have difficulty in trying to counter this," Sentix added. The report notes that Germany, in particular, is seeing a sharp downturn.
