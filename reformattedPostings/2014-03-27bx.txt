BelusLululemon was once a favorite among both yoga practitioners and growth investors. However, a series of bad decisions (banning customers who resell clothes online) and product mishaps (see-through pants) have turned off customers, making way for competitors. Comparable-store sales growth, which had been falling in recent years, turned negative and fell 2% in Q4. Belus Capital's Brian Sozzi characterized this as "a once unthinkable development." Earlier today, the yoga retailer reported that Q4 earnings came in at $0.75 per share, which was better than the $0.72 expected by analysts. Revenue of $521 million was higher than the $515 million expected. Unfortunately, guidance fell short of expectations. The company expects to earn $0.31 to $0.33 per share in Q1, much lower than the $0.38 expected. This is on sales of $377 million to $382 million versus the expectation for $389.6 million. They expect comparable-store sales to grow in the "low to mid single digits," which compares to expectations for a 4.2% decline. Sozzi said these forecasts were "worrying even when considering Lululemon is not known for guiding in line in times of operational greatness." Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon’s CEO, said "2014 is an investment year with an emphasis on strengthening our foundation, reigniting our product engine, and accelerating sustainable and controlled global expansion." The company will hold a conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss the results. Bloomberg.com FREE AppDownload
