WTI crude oil has undergone a substantial correction in the last few days. What's going on? A few reasons for this price adjustment come to mind: 1. Iran seems to be getting ready to enter the market as it prepares for sanctions to be lifted. 2. This week's employment report points to weak economic growth, tapering demand expectations for crude. In particular, private payrolls growth came in way below expectations. 3. Related to the slower growth expectations for the US as well as to the recent government shutdown is the buildup of crude oil inventories. That expectation of 3 million barrels increase was too low. The actual number this morning was 5.2 million, as inventories continue to build. FREE AppDownload
