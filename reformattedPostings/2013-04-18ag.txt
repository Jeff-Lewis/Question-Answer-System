Whoops... Reuters has accidentally posted an obituary of hedge fund billionaire George Soros. The remarkable thing is how harsh it is, basically calling the fund manager a hypocrite, and talking about all of the crises he supposedly caused by making currency bets. In the opening line, Soros, 82, is referred to as "predatory."  He's also called "an enigma, wrapped in intellect, contradiction and money" in the piece. Other critiques include the fact that he failed to buy the Washington Nationals at one point. Moments after the story was set live, Reuters Tweeted that it published the obit in error. The article has been taken down. Here's a screenshot of the entire piece (click to enlarge it):  Reuters FREE AppDownload
