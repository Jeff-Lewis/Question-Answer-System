McDonald's said in a statement late on Thursday it had imported certain products from Shanghai Husi between July last year to June this year, although no food items from the Shanghai supplier remained in stock. Hong Kong said on Thursday it had suspended, with immediate effect, all imports from the U.S.-owned Chinese supplier at the center of the scare.
