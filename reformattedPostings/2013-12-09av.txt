Weather.govThe blue areas of the map are where snow will accumulate on Tuesday, Dec. 10.This weekend has seen crazy weather all over the U.S., but NYC is due its winter weather blast tomorrow. While some snow started to stick last night, we are expected to see the first significant snowfall of the year on Tuesday, after the slushy/foggy mess that was last night moves through the city. AccuWeather says the snow could be falling for up to 8 hours. It's tough to guess how much snow we will get, but most areas of New York seem to be expecting at least one inch of accumulation. The National Weather Service says that up to 3 inches of snow could fall in Central Park, though the Weather Channel says it could be less than an inch of accumulation in the city.  Even if we don't get much snow, temperatures are going to plunge later in the week. The cold front will move through on Tuesday night, and a sunny Wednesday will hover around freezing, though Thursday will have highs (yes, HIGHS) in the upper 20s. BRRRR. FREE AppDownload
