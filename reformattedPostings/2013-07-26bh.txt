Getty / Michael NagleDominique Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF head and onetime potential French president, will face trial for pimping charges, his lawyer confirmed to Reuters on Friday. Strauss-Kahn, also known as "DSK," had a spectacular fall from grace when he was accused of rape by a New York City hotel maid in 2010. While the case never went to trial, it cost Strauss-Kahn his job and presidential ambitions. Strauss-Kahn was forced to borrow millions from his wife Anne Sinclair to pay a civil settlement reached with the maid (they later divorced). The new pimping charges relate to a French investigation of Strauss-Kahn's alleged involvement in a prostitution ring at the Carlton Lille hotel. Strauss-Kahn has admitted to attending the parties, but denies any knowledge that prostitutes were in attendance. FREE AppDownload
