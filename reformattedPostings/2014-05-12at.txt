CorcoranSome people just don't know how to appreciate a deal. According to Page Six, billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen — whose hedge fund S.A.C. Capital pleaded guilty to insider trading last year — can't unload his Upper East Side duplex penthouse, and it's upsetting him a great deal. From Page Six: One source tells us, “Cohen hasn’t had a buyer, and he blames his broker. Furious is not the word. He’s had enough.” But another source sniffed, “The lack of a buyer might be because some feel the place might have some bad karma.” The apartment has been on sale for over a year, and has already seen one price chop, from $115 million to $98 million. What more must Cohen give? Corcoran has the details of the 9,000-square-foot, four bedroom, 5.5 bathroom apartment at One Beacon Court. It's definitely impressive, especially considering Cohen bought the space for a mere $24 million. Look and see for yourself. FREE AppDownload
