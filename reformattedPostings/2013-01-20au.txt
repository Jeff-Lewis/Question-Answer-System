Business InsiderI'm in Munich this morning, jet-lagged to all hell (so I apologize in advance for any giddiness). I came to do a panel at the DLD conference.  The DLD folks were kind enough to airmail me over last night via Lufthansa Business Class through Dusseldorf. Well, it's always fun to catch up on what life is like up in the front of the bus. And in case you haven't flown Lufthansa Business Class lately, I thought you might be curious, too.
