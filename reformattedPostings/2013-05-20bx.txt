This is a chart that people don't much look at these days. It's updated semi-regularly by Doug Short, and it compares the great US bear market (starting in 2000) with the great Nikkei bear and the Great Depression bear. For awhile all 3 were looking very similarly, but at this point it's clear. The US has broken away from history, and with stocks hitting new highs, doesn't even vaguely resemble the past ones.
