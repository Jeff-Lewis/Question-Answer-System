Daniel Goodman/Business InsiderThis is definitely a surprise. Unit Labor Costs fell a stunning 4.3% in Q1, according to the BLS:  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses fell 4.3 percent in the first  quarter of 2013, the combined effect of a 3.8 percent decrease in hourly  compensation and the 0.5 percent increase in productivity. The decline in  hourly compensation is the largest in the series, which begins in 1947.  However, over the last four quarters hourly compensation increased 2.0  percent and unit labor costs rose 1.1 percent. This compares unfavorably to expectations of a 0.5% increase. FREE AppDownload
