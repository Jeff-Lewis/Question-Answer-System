EPAThe cleanup continues after an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying crude from Alberta's tar sands ruptured in Mayflower, Ark., last week.  New photos from the EPA show the extent of the damage.  At least 60 homes were impacted, and oil entered a creek connected to a cove attached to Lake Conway, a tributary that leads to the Arkansas River. Exxon said in a statement that the oil did not reach Lake Conway, although "ducks, turtles, a beaver and a muskrat" were affected. About 5,000 barrels of oil spilled, although the final figures have not yet been released, the company said.
