Oli Scarff/Getty Images The eurozone's inflation just rose to 0.4%, from 0.3%. Unemployment stayed flat at an eye-watering 11.5%. On inflation, analysts were expecting the slight climb to 0.4%. That might be a signal that Europe isn't heading into a deflationary spiral, but the figure is still far below the European Central Bank's 2% target, and it is likely to be very low for a long time.  And it's not all good news on inflation: The eurozone's measure of core inflation, which strips out the most volatile prices in the index, is still falling. It's down to 0.7% from 0.8% in September. That's the joint-lowest level in the currency union's history. So while it has some room to breathe, the ECB isn't off the hook yet. Capital Economics' Jennifer McKeown explains in a note:  Analysts weren't expecting a change in the unemployment figure. It has slowly declined from 12% earlier this year. However, Italian unemployment figures just out showed an unexpected spike to 12.5% from 12.3%. FREE AppDownload
