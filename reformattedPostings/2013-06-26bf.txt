We’ve done a lot of articles on value and drawdowns on the blog before (search the archives).  I was curious what happens when you bought the US equity sectors back when they were really hammered (French Fama to 1920s).   Average 3 year nominal returns when buying a sector down since 1920s: 60% = 57% 70% = 87% 80% = 172% 90% = 240% Average 3 year nominal returns when buying an industry down since 1920s: 60% = 71% 70% = 96% 80% = 136% 90% = 115% Average 3 year nominal returns when buying a country down since 1970s: 60% = 107% 70% = 116% 80% = 118% 90% = 156%  It’s hard to buy something down 80%, especially if you owned it when it was down 30, 50, then 80%.  But usually that is a great time to be wading in…Some recent examples of assets that have gotten clobbered include tech in 2002, homebuilders in 2009, and Greece and (Junior) Gold Miners now.   FREE AppDownload
