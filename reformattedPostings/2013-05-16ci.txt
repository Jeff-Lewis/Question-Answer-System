Wikimedia Commons"Au Salon de la Rue des Moulins" Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec Markets are in the red early in the European trading session. England's FTSE 100 is flat. France's CAC 40 is down 0.5%. Germany's DAX is down 0.4%. Spain's IBEX is down 0.4% Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.4%. It's pretty quiet in Europe in terms of market moving economic news. All of this comes in the wake of a big GDP report in Japan where Abenomics appeared to have caused the economy to surge by 3.5% year-over-year in Q1.  Economists were looking for a 2.8% growth rate. Yesterday, European stocks closed at their highest levels since June 2008. It's worth noting that gold is getting slammed again, falling by $22 per ounce today. FREE AppDownload
