"A re-acceleration in Chinese industrial production growth to 9.7% [year over year] (thanks to steel and auto production increases), has helped boost positive risk sentiment into the weekend," says Société Générale global strategist Kit Juckes. "[Emerging markets] currencies are stronger across the board, the [Aussie dollar] short-covering rally is continuing and only the yen’s strength is inconsistent with this overall picture. That’s testament to the pressure for positions to be squared and probably tells us not to take any of the current price action too seriously." French industrial production unexpectedly plunged in June – down 1.4% following a 0.3% decline in May. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.3%. "In the details, the contraction in industrial activity in June was mainly driven by a slump in output of utilities (-5.4%)," says Morgan Stanley economist Olivier Bizimana. "Production declined in almost all the main branches of the manufacturing industry as well (-0.4%). In particular, output in the manufacture of food products and beverages showed the largest decline (-2.9%)." FREE AppDownload
