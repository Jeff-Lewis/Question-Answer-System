We recently had our our co-workers try Herbalife's Formula 1 shake for the first time. For the most part, people didn't like the shakes.  Herbalife told us the reason is that we didn't use a blender for our test.  The packaging says stir or blend.  "...we were all disappointed about was the way in which you trialled the shakes  - by mixing them with a spoon in a small cup - as it was not representative at all of what a shake should look or taste like," a company spokesperson said in an email to Business Insider. "The shakes should be made using a blender and at the bare minimum a handful of ice; and that's before we get into the many variations of fruits, nuts and other ingredients that can be used to flavor them to taste," the email said.
