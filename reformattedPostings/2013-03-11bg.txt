Christie's Real EstateEveryone is buzzing about a Bloomberg News report that billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson is considering moving to Puerto Rico to take advantage of a new tax law. Bloomberg News also reports that closely-followed hedge fund manager "recently looked at real estate in the exclusive Condado neighborhood of San Juan, where an 8,379- square-foot penthouse, complete with six underground parking spaces, lists for $5 million. The area is home to St. John’s School, a private English-language academy where he and his wife could send their two children, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private." Paulson &amp; Co. acknowledged it has looked at real estate there, but doesn't currently hold anything, the report said.  We were able to track down the $5 million Acquamarina penthouse listed by Trillion Realty Group, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate, matching that exact description.  It's definitely a dream home in paradise and now we're going to take a tour.  FREE AppDownload
