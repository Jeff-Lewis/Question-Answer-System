Nationwide home prices, including distressed sales, climbed 9.7 percent year-over-year (YoY) in January, according to CoreLogic's latest home price report. This is the eleventh straight monthly rise, and it's the biggest gain since April 2006. On the month, home prices were up 0.7 percent. Ex-distressed sales, home prices were up 9 percent on the year, and 1.8 percent on the month. “The HPI showed strong growth during the typically slow winter season,” said Mark Fleming, chief economist for CoreLogic. “With these gains, the housing market is poised to enter the spring selling season on sound footing.” Paul Diggle at Capital Economics thinks that concerns of "overstretched" home prices are overblown since housing is still "20 percent undervalued relative to incomes and 5 percent undervalued relative to rents". "Indeed, with only 4.6 months of supply of unsold stock on the market in January, well below the long-run average of 7 months, we expect near double-digit gains in prices until at least the middle of the year," he adds.
