Carmen ShieldsProducer prices contracted -0.2% in May. Expectations were for growth 0f 0.1%, against 0.6% prior. Ex- food and energy, prices contracted -0.1%. Producer prices climbed 2% year-over-year.  Capital Economics says the underlying trend remains upward. "Roughly half of the fall was due to a 0.2% m/m drop in food prices and a 0.2% m/m decline in energy prices," the firm said. "Prices of other items fell by 0.1% m/m. This was mainly because of a 0.5% m/m decline in the margins of wholesalers and retailers. These profit margins are very volatile from one month to the next and, after rising by 1.4% m/m in both March and April, a decline always seemed likely in May. The bigger point, though, is that the trend remains up. In the three months to May, these margins rose at an annualised rate of 9.3%." FREE AppDownload
