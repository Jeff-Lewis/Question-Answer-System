star5112 / FlickrChina's NBS just published its official manufacturing PMI report, and it's a bit of a disappointment. The headline number unexpectedly slipped to 50.4 in January. Economists were expecting an increase to 51.0 from 50.6 in December. The good news: any reading above 50 signals expansion.     Earlier this month, the January HSBC Flash PMI jumped to 51.9, a two-year high. HSBC's PMI reading is more tilted toward small and medium sized enterprises, which are a bit more cyclical than the large companies. The PMI reports are big deals because for months people have questioning whether China would face a hard or soft landing.  With the economy showing signs of re-acceleration again, people are looking for confirmation that the world's second largest economy is really picking up.
