AccentureOne of the biggest complaints we hear from America's employers is the inability to find skilled workers. This is a big problem in an economy that's trying to grow. Not only does it hinder growth, it also puts a crimp on profit margins. Accenture and The Manufacturing Institute recently published the findings of a big study the conducted, which included a survey of over 300 manufacturing executives. Of those surveyed, 39% said they faced a severe shortage of qualified applicants and 60% said it was difficult to hire the skilled people they needed. Accenture ran the numbers to see what this meant in terms of costs: Respondents in our survey reported three primary areas of negative impact due to these roles going unfilled. The average company in our survey reported a 12 percent increase in overtime cost, which, for our median company, would increase overtime costs by $1 million annually. Our median company also matches the average survey respondent in that they report a 10 percent increase in downtime and an eight percent increase in cycle time. Based on those assumptions, the analysts found that a hypothetical 2,000-employee manufacturer with $500 million in annual revenue was losing around 11% of operating earnings, or $4.6 million per year. 11% of earnings is no small amount of money. Accenture said that over 50% of those surveyed had plans to increase US-based production by at least 5% in the next five years. Unemployment remains arguably high in the U.S. But it's becoming increasingly clear that there are jobs available for those with the right skills. FREE AppDownload
