UBS forecasts that the US economic recovery will continue until at least 2016. "With the Fed's QE program terminating in the current Q4(14), the economy finally will be 'on its own,'" UBS' Maury Harris said. "Continuation of the momentum initiated by expansive stabilization policies will entail various legacy effects of earlier growth." The firm projects that real GDP growth will be at 2.8% in 2016. It forecasts 2.9% for 2015, revised downward from 3.2% because of the potential impacts of a stronger dollar and lower foreign growth. The firmer dollar could draw capital into the US, although a sliding trade balance could remove half a percentage point from Q4 growth in 2015 and 2016, they wrote.  UBS expects wage and price inflation to modestly increase, with core PCE inflation — the Fed's preferred measure — expected at 2.1% in 2015 and 2.2% in 2016.  The firm maintains its projection for the Fed's first rate hikes in mid-2015, and it sees the federal funds rate at 2.875% at the end of 2016. The fed has held this rate near zero since the 2008 recession. "Moderately accelerating wage and price inflation" will be important for rising interest rates, it wrote. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note will be in the range of 3% to 4%, it forecast. FREE AppDownload
