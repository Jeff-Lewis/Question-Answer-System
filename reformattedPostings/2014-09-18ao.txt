Flickr/OracleLarry Ellison is stepping down as CEO of Oracle.  In honor of his long career, let's take a look back at his life.  Ellison is a true rags-to-riches story. After growing up in a poor neighborhood in Chicago, he decided to drop out of college and drive across the country to California, where he would found Oracle.  He now has a net worth of $51.3 billion and the fabulous lifestyle to go along with it. He's been called "the nation's most avid trophy-home buyer" and has all but taken over entire neighborhoods in Malibu and the Lake Tahoe area. He even purchased the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for an estimated $300 million in 2012. He also has an amazing collection of supercars, planes, and yachts. FREE AppDownload
