CNNBoston police say that the incident at JFK Library in Boston appears to be a fire. At a press conference earlier this afternoon, Boston police commissioner Edward Davis confirmed that there was a third explosion at the library. But that appears to be inaccurate, and it's not related to the explosions at the marathon. Davis said the first two explosions were "simultaneous" and occurred at 2:50 p.m. He declined to give numbers on fatalities, but Boston PD previously announced that are 22 injured and 2 dead. A Boston PD spokesperson tweeted that the incident at the library is "fire related." Davis said it was "very much an ongoing incident." He also declined to speculate on a motive, saying, "We are not being definitive right now." You can find our live-blog of the press conference below.
