Also, any reading above 50 signals growth, which means the US services sector is growing at a healthy clip. From the report: "The New Orders Index registered 61 percent, 2.8 percentage points lower than the reading of 63.8 percent registered in August. The Employment Index increased 1.4 percentage points to 58.5 percent from the August reading of 57.1 percent and indicates growth for the seventh consecutive month. The Prices Index decreased 2.5 percentage points from the August reading of 57.7 percent to 55.2 percent, indicating prices increased at a slower rate in September when compared to August." All 12 industries submitting responses to this survey reported growth. Here are some quotes from the report: Earlier, we learned the September Markit services PMI was revised up to 58.9 from a preliminary (Flash) estimated of 58.5. This was down from 59.5 in August. But the report was still stronger than expected and it reflects a strong pace of growth. "A slowing in the pace of service sector growth in September matched a similar easing in the pace of manufacturing output growth seen during the month, suggesting the overall pace of economic expansion dipped to the weakest since May.," Markit's Chris Williamson said. "But the surveys nevertheless still point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of at least 3% in the third quarter." FREE AppDownload
