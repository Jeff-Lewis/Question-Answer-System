Youtube.comJefferies CEO Rich Handler has an amazing ALS Ice Bucket Challenge video in which he fills his Jacuzzi in his Tribeca penthouse with several bags of ice before dunking himself in it. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is a social-media movement where people are dared to dump ice water on their heads or donate money to an ALS organization. Politicians, celebrities, and Wall Streeters have all taken part in the movement. Handler challenged long-time Jefferies' client Carl Icahn to do it next. Icahn teased him on Twitter saying that he's "too busy" working on a "BIG deal" with another investment bank. Handler also challenged Landry's CEO Tilman Fertitta, Bank of New York Mellon's CEO Gerald Hassel and rapper Pitbull.  Watch below:  FREE AppDownload
