Author and writer Susan Blumberg-Kason has been interested in Hong Kong since an early age, when she dreamed of the the neon streets and double-decker buses. She soon moved there to study and married a Chinese man. The memoir about her experiences, "Good Chinese Wife," came out this year. While in Hong Kong, Blumberg-Kason took photographs to document her surroundings. Later, when sifting through her many shots, she realized how closely they mirrored photographs taken in Hong Kong by her parents 50 years before. Blumberg-Kason had shared both her own photographs, taken in 2012, and her parents' photographs from 1962, which give parallel views of a city that has grown exponentially. In those 50 years, Hong Kong Island and the surrounding areas saw tons of new construction and a massive influx in population. FREE AppDownload
