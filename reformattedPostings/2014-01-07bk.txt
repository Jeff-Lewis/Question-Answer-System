Among the most-read posts on reddit's Bitcoin thread today is one about a guy who's performed the first Bitcoin transaction in North Korea. Sounds like a big breakthrough, right? But the details make the story really unimpressive. It turns out it's just a dude (of unknown origins but who's fluent in English) on a Chinese-run North Korea tour who had Internet access most actual North Koreans never get to see. "I believe that this is the first time a transaction on the blockchain has been broadcast from this country," he clarifies.  He did send his Bitcoin (though he does not specify the amount) to a charity.  Still, the real breakthrough will come when North Koreans themselves are able to use Bitcoin. Here's his photo: bitcoindprk/reddit FREE AppDownload
