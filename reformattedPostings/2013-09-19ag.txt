REUTERS/Henny Ray AbramsBillionaire investor Carl Icahn told CNBC's Maria Bartiromo in a telephone interview this afternoon that he agrees with Warren Buffett that stocks are fully valued.    "I think at the risk of being modest, we're up 30% and yet we have a huge hedge on because I agree with what Warren Buffett said.  I think right now the market is giving you a false picture. I don't think a lot of companies are doing that well.  They're taking advantage of low interest rates," Icahn said, adding, you don't have to be a "genius" to figure that out.   Earlier on CNBC, Buffett noted that the economy continues to "creep along."  FREE AppDownload
