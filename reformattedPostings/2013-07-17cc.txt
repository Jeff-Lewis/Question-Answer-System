FlickrU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew gave the opening keynote at the CNBC/Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference to a room full of hedge funders and institutional investors. In his first speech to a large group of Wall Streeters, he talked about financial regulation.  (Next week is the third anniversary of Dodd-Frank.) "By the end of this year, the core elements of the Dodd-Frank Act will be in place." He also fired a shot at the audience. Lew said there were some, including "some in this room", who attempted to weaken the bill and slow down implementation.  The reason for financial regulation, he explained, is that when President Obama took office in 2008, the economy was in free fall. Some financial firms took on too much risk and sold risky financial products. During that time, regulators failed to detect the abuses that occurred.  "Putting out the fires was not enough," Lew said, adding that they had to strengthen the rules. Lew said that Dodd-Frank did not stifle growth.  Instead, he says banks have more capital on hand and that the housing market is recovering and home values are recovering across the country. He notes that there are some lingering scars from the crisis. FREE AppDownload
