APCongress will need to either hike or suspend the nation's debt ceiling in February, and so far, senators on both sides of the aisle are predicting this fight will be much less climactic than previous squabbles in 2013 and 2011. But there are a few reasons that the debt ceiling could again become another game of chicken. Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners in Washington, has been adamant that it's the largest potential macro tail risk on the economy coming out of Washington this year. In a note to clients on Friday, Krueger outlined the three main reasons why it's time to start worrying about the debt ceiling: "We do not foresee another fight over defunding ObamaCare, but we would not be surprised to see another fight go down to the wire with another version of a budgetary kick-the-can end result," Krueger wrote. " This could well result in fiscal brinksmanship that will make markets nervous, though the end result is likely more of the same D.C. endgame. Washington will continue to kick the can, until the can kicks back." House Republicans will plot their strategy on the debt ceiling next week, when they hold their annual retreat in Maryland.
