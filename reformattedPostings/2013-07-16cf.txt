An important nugget here from Markit on the bad situation in the UK for workers. Annual wage growth is running far behind the rate of inflation, which means that on a "real" basis, workers are making less and less. UK inflation running at 2.9% while regular pay grows at an average annual rate of just 0.9% http://t.co/b2YPJ1VaL5 pic.twitter.com/OV9VtfDzDd FRED FREE AppDownload
