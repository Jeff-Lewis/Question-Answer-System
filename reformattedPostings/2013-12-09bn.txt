The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University is out with a new study today on the state of the rental housing market in the United States. Rental rates have increased significantly in recent years and there are now 43 million renter households across the country. More than half of renters earn less than $30,000 per year, with 22% earning less than $15,000. The chart below compares the rentership rate of major America cities. Los Angeles has the highest rental rate at more than 50%. St. Louis and Minneapolis are last at nearly 30%. Check it out: Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University FREE AppDownload
