More signs of muddle through here as weekly rail traffic comes in pretty stagnant again.  This week’s intermodal reading was 2.5% year over year which brings the 12 week moving average to 1.64%.  That’s the lowest level since the first week of January and clearly not a sign of a robust economy. Here’s more via AAR: “The Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported mixed traffic for the week ending June 8, 2013, with total U.S. weekly carloads of 278,249 carloads, down 2.8 percent compared with the same week last year.
