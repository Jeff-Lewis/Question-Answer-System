Norway has been ranked the most prosperous country in the world for the sixth year in a row, according to a new report on global prosperity released today by the Legatum Institute.  The 142 countries on the annual Prosperity Index were ranked using a "GDP and beyond" approach that measures a country's prosperity according to the strength of its economy, entrepreneurship and opportunity, governance, education, health, and safety. Personal freedom and social capital are considered as well.  Here is a graphic of the findings from the report (and here is the full report): Legatum Institute   Switzerland and New Zealand rank just behind Norway as the world's most prosperous nations, while the UK boasts the third lowest start-up costs in the world, making it extremely entrepreneur-friendly. Central African Republic remains at the bottom of the list for the third consecutive year.
