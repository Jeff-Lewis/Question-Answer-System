An alleged insider trading scams was exposed via LinkedIn after a suspicious broker used the social media network to uncover links between a banker trading in foreign currency and a government statistician. The foreign exchange broker, Owen Kerr, had been alerted by a staff member that a client, National Australia Bank associate director Lukas Kamay, was apparently making large bets on the Australian dollar, frequently seconds or minutes before the official announcement of economic data at the regular release time of 11.30am. Examining Kamay’s LinkedIn account, Mr Kerr realized the banker had been to Monash University with a man named Christopher Hill, who worked at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The link was passed on to police, who conducted a nine-month surveillance operation which eventually led to the arrests of Kamay and Hill last week over an alleged scam in which they are believed to have netted up to $6.6 million. Police also made inquiries through Facebook to discover that the two men were “friends”. Kamay, 26, who faces seven charges, allegedly offered his friend more than $47,240 to disclose the inside information. Authorities have frozen his assets, including his purchase of a luxury $2.19 million loft apartment in inner city Melbourne. Hill, 24, who faces five charges, allegedly provided confidential information such as housing and building approval figures to ‘‘predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar’’. Mr Kerr, from Pepperstone Financial, said the currency trades were usually submitted at about 11.25am but sometimes just 30 seconds before the official data was released. “Kamay was taking quite decent size positions which were larger than his account size could sustain if they went the wrong way,” he said. “So they were really an all-or-nothing bet and not something someone would normally rationally make.”  FREE AppDownload
