Malia wore a darker purple coat. FLOTUS was in a what appeared to be tailored steel greyish coat."   Here's a picture of some attendees doing the Cupid Shuffle while they wait for Obama to arrive at the Capitol.&nbsp;  Malia Obama is wearing a J.Crew ensemble.

Today, we remember what we share in common. &nbsp; We serve the same country, one that is&nbsp;still&nbsp;in need of repair&mdash;and is&nbsp;still&nbsp;the freest on earth. We serve alongside&nbsp;men and women from both parties, who govern in good faith and good will.&nbsp;Finally, we serve the same people, who have honored us with&nbsp;their&nbsp;charge. &nbsp; We&nbsp;may&nbsp;disagree on matters of policy. But today we remember why we&nbsp;take&nbsp;those&nbsp;matters&nbsp;so seriously&mdash;because we seek the public good.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s our highest duty&mdash;one that we share&mdash;and one for which we&rsquo;re grateful. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m&nbsp;happy&nbsp;to mark this historic occasion&mdash;for the president and for the country. And I look forward to tackling the big challenges ahead.
