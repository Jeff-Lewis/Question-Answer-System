If you're going to quit your job to pursue your dream job of making cakes for a living, then writing your resignation letter on a cake is definitely the right move. On his 31st birthday, Chris Holmes—now known to the public as "Mr. Cake"—decided it was time to quit his job as a Border Agency official at London's Stansted Airport and do something he's passionate about that would allow him to spend more time with this family.  For Holmes, this meant pursuing a cake business called Mr. Cake and notifying his employers with actual icing on a cake. Holmes' sweet resignation letter quickly went viral when his brother-in-law tweeted a picture of it to the world. Note the bottom of the cake has a nice plug for his business, so this is great marketing as well: So, my brother-in-law has resigned from his 9-to-5 job in spectacular fashion.

"... Having set up a cake company, I thought I would leave them with a memento that would be a nice way of remembering me. I had the idea six months ago so I've kept it to myself since then." "I think [my boss] was pleasantly surprised, of all the resignations businesses get, I think that's probably a nice way for an employee to leave and I hope they enjoyed the cake as well as the resignation." Holmes' employers told Harper that they wished him "all the best" in his new business venture. FREE AppDownload
