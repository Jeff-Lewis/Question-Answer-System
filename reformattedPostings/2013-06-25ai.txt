Last Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke rocked the global financial markets by telling us that the Fed could begin to taper, or gradually reduce, it's month purchases of $85 billion dollar worth of Treasury and mortgage bonds. Since then, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said, "the Committee’s decision to authorize the Chairman to lay out a more elaborate plan for reducing the pace of asset purchases was inappropriately timed." “The committee’s communications have provided insufficient detail about how its policy strategy will play out when the recovery is more advanced,” criticized Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota in a note on Monday. Many more Fed officials will be speaking during the balance of this week.
