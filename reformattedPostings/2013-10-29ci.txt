Heather Holland/DNAinfo.comJim Gallagher, a 65-year-old bartender at Molly’s, quit drinking for 18 years, and said he would never go back.Quick heads up. There are some interesting economic numbers coming out later today. Here they are, via Calculated Risk: • At 8:30 AM ET, Retail sales for September. The consensus is for retail sales to be unchanged in September, and to increase 0.4% ex-autos.  • At 9:00 AM, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for August. Although this is the August report, it is really a 3 month average of June, July and August. The consensus is for a 12.4% year-over-year increase in the Composite 20 index (NSA) for August.  • At 10:00 AM, Conference Board's consumer confidence index for October. The consensus is for the index to decrease to 75.0 from 79.7. Each of these is significant. Retail Sales and Consumer Confidence should be edifying for further gauging impact of the recent government crisis. FREE AppDownload
