From the Financial Times:  About 20 protesters gathered outside the meeting at the Hilton hotel on Sixth Avenue in New York, chanting “banks got bailed out; we got sold out”. While they mostly walked in a circle holding signs, one female protester skated by on roller blades, dressed in spandex, carrying a sign reading: “bankers need a spanking”. Hilarious.
