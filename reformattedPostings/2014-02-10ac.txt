Spain grew 0.3% in Q4 2013, but unemployment ticked higher to 26.03%, from 25.98% the previous quarter. Soaring unemployment and a housing bust have caused a surge in evictions as borrowers are unable to pay their mortgages. We've previously talked about the ongoing eviction crisis in Spain. In southern Madrid gangs reportedly scout around for abandoned real estate and then pose as fake landlords. But with the help of anti-eviction activists, some have started moving into abandoned buildings. Reuters reports that nine families that had been evicted, occupied a building in Alovera, north of Madrid, that had been abandoned since 2008. Anti-eviction activists went public with the occupation of the building last year. Susana Vera at Reuters visited the abandoned building to see what life is like.

Cabrera, a single mother, lost her job at a courier company in 2011.

Idider's husband, Mohssin El Molahed, suffered a work-related accident in 2009 that left him with a disability, but he doesn't receive any state aid.
