The firm predicts moderately stronger growth in the coming year, slightly higher interest rates, and the Federal Reserve to taper.  "Many of the conditions of the last few years— slow growth, low interest rates, and very low inflation—are likely to persist," Blackrock writes. "Not an ideal environment, but one that should support further gains in stocks, and perhaps hints at a virtuous cycle of global growth that could be possible if the stars align." Here are three key stories Blackrock highlights: "Modestly stronger growth should lead to slightly higher interest rates—but we do not expect a sharp or rapid acceleration," Blackrock writes.

"It is important to remember that stocks still represent a better value than cash and bonds. In short, we would remain overweight equities." FREE AppDownload
