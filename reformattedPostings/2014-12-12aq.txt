The relentless plunge in oil prices shows no sign of stopping. As of about 1:00 pm ET on Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude was trading at around $58 per barrel, a loss of about 3% in the last 24 hours. On Friday morning, WTI futures briefly cracked $58 for the first time since May 2009. Investing.com The price initially dipped below $60 Thursday. The International Energy Agency just cut its forecast for oil demand for the fourth time in five months, a pretty strong signal that there will be no upswing in prices anytime soon.  The price of WTI is down by nearly 45% since mid-June, plunging from above $107 per barrel to below $60.  Investing.com, Business Insider Brent crude, the international benchmark, is falling too, down 2.5% on Friday to as low as $62.07.
