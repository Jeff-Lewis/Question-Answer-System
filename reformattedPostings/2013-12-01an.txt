This morning, a Metro North train derailed in the Bronx, and initial reports indicated that one or more of the cars had gone into the water. Fortunately those reports were untrue. However, one car did come extremely close. Shimon Prokupecz, a producer at CNN, tweeted this image, noting that there were divers in the water, searching to see if any passengers had been ejected into the water. It was that close.
