The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a peculiar stock market index for several reasons. For one, it's a price-weighted index, which means a stock with a high per-share price will have a greater influence on the index's fluctuations. And currently, a one-point move in any single Dow stock moves the Dow by 6.4219 points. As of yesterday's market close, the three highest-priced stocks in the Dow were Visa ($195), IBM ($186), and Goldman Sachs ($162). Early in trading, IBM and Goldman Sachs are each down sharply in the wake of their earnings announcements. IBM is down $13.45, which hacks 86 points from the Dow. Goldman is down $4.09, which shaves 26 points from the Dow. So, two stocks are responsible for a 112-point decline in the Dow. Now you see why people hate the Dow. FREE AppDownload
