Godzilla.The stock market has been heading lower all day. Right now, the S&amp;P 500 is down 1.4% to start the week, trading at 1811. The Nasdaq is down 1.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%. The U.S. dollar is down 1.2% against the Japanese yen today, trading near ¥102.90. "Admittedly, the pullback has been from record highs, so we're reluctant to call it anything more than a consolidation after a solid run," says Ian Lyngen, a senior government bond strategist at CRT Capital. "We're skeptical of the explanations offered for the pullback, such as attributing the move to the Fed's tapering decision and/or valuation concerns — this strikes us as simply excuses chasing price action." As stocks fall, Treasuries are heading higher. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is trading at 2.82%, 4 basis points below Friday's close. No major economic data reports were released today, but Tuesday, the U.S. Census Bureau releases advance retail sales figures for the month of December. FREE AppDownload
