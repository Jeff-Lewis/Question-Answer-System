The California man is attempting to sue the magazine after it published a cover story by Leah McGrath Goodman alleging that Nakamoto was actually the Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin. After the article appeared, Dorian denied being Satoshi (although that is his middle name), as well as any involvement in the creation of the online currency. Now he has created a legal defense fund to help his case. The URL is newsweeklied.com Nakamoto is not trying to legally defend himself — contributions go toward his attempt to sue Newsweek for its article. According to the website, “Dorian's Legal Defense Fund is a separate effort, authorized and endorsed by Dorian, to raise money to hold Newsweek accountable for their article. A lawsuit against Newsweek will be very expensive.” Donations to the fund can be made by credit or debit card, or in bitcoin. Both Newsweek and Nakamoto (through his attorney) declined to comment to Business Insider. Nakamoto's attorney, Ethan Kirschner, confirmed in an email that his law office is "responsible for the website and the fund." FREE AppDownload
