Sony Corp said on Wednesday it expects to log a 50 billion yen ($489 million) net loss this financial year, its sixth in seven years, and plans additional restructuring measures that include its loss-making PC operations. TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp &lt;6758.T&gt; is not thinking about selling or exiting the TV manufacturing business, where it has racked up annual losses for the past decade, although it would not rule out an equity tie-up, the company's chief executive said on Thursday. Kazuo Hirai added that the company was not operating under the assumption that it would forge an equity alliance for its struggling TV division, which will be turned into a separate entity this summer to boost transparency. Hirai also said the company did not plan to change the framework of focusing its electronics division on the three core businesses of mobile, imaging and games through the next fiscal year and beyond.
