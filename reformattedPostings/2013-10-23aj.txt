AppleAs one of the most traded stocks in the world, Apple is a major gear in the global equity markets, and when the company releases new products, markets react. A new study by Kensho Research models the performance of select tech and semiconductor stocks in the three trading days following previous releases of new models of the iPad by Apple. For the iPad Air, that would be equivalent to buying on November 1, 2013, and holding for the following three trading days. Strikingly, Apple supplier Omnivision Technologies (OVTI) rallies an average of 4.37% in the three trading days following previous iPad releases, while Cirrus Logic, another Apple supplier, returns an average of 3.23%. Apple itself has never declined in the three trading days following the last six releases of new models of the iPad, and shares of the tech giant see a cumulative return of 14% when all the three day gains following historical iPad releases are added up. Like so many other Apple customers, I think the gains in the stock from trading the product release on November 1st will easily pay for the new device. This article originally appeared at Kensho.
