CNBCs Rick Santelli is known for his explosions, but today's scream-fest over a discussion with Kelly Evans, Steve Liesman and three very patient guests was over the top, even for him. Evans was talking about some thoughts a U.K. investor overseas shared with her on the risk of the U.S. having yet another fiscal cliff battle. The investor said he saw the economy recovering and was expecting bond yields to move higher, "aside from an insane technical default brought on by lunatic Republicans." "That's the worry here," Evans continued. "Will we have a self inflicted wound — a gunshot to the head." And Santelli was off. "What about the lunatics that spend 16.4 trillion and want another check," he screamed. "Aren't they the crazies, Kelly?" The next minute or so is a stressful attempt by Evans to get the show back on the road as Santelli interrupts over and over again. The most painful moment comes at the end when Santelli goes into total rage mode, flailing his arms and saying, "You gotta be a man when you look at the debt. If it means uncomfortability, if it means going over the cliff, if it means the government closing, my kids will thank me someday for it." To which one tired guest replied, "I doubt it." "I'd like to see if you run your personal finances that way," Santelli countered. That's when there was basically a collective sigh from the group as Liesman and a guest tried to explain that personal finances and government finances are not the same.
