This appears to be reflecting concerns that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay lenders when this liabilities come due.  However, one analyst believes this is a great time to buy this short-term government debt on the cheap.  Here's Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics:   "Strategies abound for avoiding a default on T-bills, notes and bonds. We do not have to go into all of them here, but you can be sure Treasury has a plan B as well as plans C, D and E to avoid disaster. It has had plenty of time to work on them. Prioritizing payments to cover the debt is an obvious strategy. A more sophisticated plan would be to roll over maturing debt into super-high-coupon long-term bonds that would sell at a huge premium over par. Yes, Treasury will be selling bonds even after the debt ceiling is reached to roll over maturing bills and notes. Take a maturing bill with a face value of $100 and roll it over into a 20% coupon 30-year bond with a $100 face value. That long term bond would raise $400 in cash at an auction in today's market yields, but the rollover would not increase the debt...."
