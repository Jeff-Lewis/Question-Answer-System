And the Nikkei fell slightly. The big story of the day so far is the big rally in China. The Shanghai Composite gained 2.9% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 2.7%. These gains came after China released the reform decisions made after the "Third Plenum" late Friday. The reforms included social changes (an end to forced labor camps and a loosening of the one-child policy) as well as economic reforms. Otherwise, today is a slow day with little big economic news expected to come out. FREE AppDownload
