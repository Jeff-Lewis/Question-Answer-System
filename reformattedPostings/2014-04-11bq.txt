American banking giant JPMorgan just reported its first-quarter revenue and earnings, which fell sharply year over year. Earnings per share fell to $1.28 from $1.59 a year ago, which was worse than the $1.40 expected by analysts. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion, which was worse than the $24.4 billion expected. The stock is down by about 2% in pre-market trading. Banks such as JPMorgan continue to feel the pain from two trends: one, falling mortgage activity and, two, falling fixed-income trading activity. The weakness is captured in two slides from JPMorgan's 22-slide earnings presentation. The first slide summarizes the consumer and community banking unit, which shows that mortgage production revenue plunged by 76% thanks to a 68% dive in mortgage originations. In its earnings release, management said mortgage-application volume fell 57% year over year and 17% from the previous quarter. This unit has seen 14,000 layoffs in the last year. JP Morgan The second slide summarizes the corporate and investment bank division. This is the unit that captures the firm's trading activities. As you can see, markets revenue is down 17%, largely due to a 21% plunge in fixed-income markets activity. JP Morgan Analysts expect these two trends to affect all the big banks. FREE AppDownload
