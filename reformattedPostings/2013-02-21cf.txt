Joe Weisenthal, Business InsiderSo it didn't take too long being in Milan before I realized why the city is known as one of the style capitals of the world. After a meeting with some bankers, I asked where I might find a good place to do some work with free WiFi. I was told to make a few turns out the door and check out the cafe at Trussardi Life. Turns out, that that cafe is an appendage to a boutique for the age-old Italian luxury brand Trussardi. It was by far the most hip experience I've ever had getting free wifi. Even getting the password to the wifi was cool. FREE AppDownload
