Stephanie and ShereenHarvard Business School is one of the most exclusive institutions in the world: Only 13% of applicants were admitted last year, and it is US News' top-ranked business school. An MBA from Harvard is the path to the corner office and a six-figure salary right out of school, and also a place where entrepreneurs are born. Famous alumni include Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and NYC Mayor and Bloomberg LP founder Michael Bloomberg.   We found the most impressive students currently getting their MBAs — many of whom aren't waiting to graduate to get their businesses going. One went to Princeton at 16 before joining Microsoft as an engineer. Another sold his successful startup for more than $100 million and published a book before enrolling. People we've spoken to at Harvard agree that these students are among the school's finest.  And they're just getting started.  FREE AppDownload
