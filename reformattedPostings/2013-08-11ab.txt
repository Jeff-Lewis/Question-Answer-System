DVIDSHUB/FlickrJapan's Q2 GDP growth missed expectations, hitting 2.6% against 3.6% expected. The Yen hit $96.04 against $96.33 prior to the data print, MarketWatch's Michael Kitchen says. The Nikkei is also off -1.26%. Seasonally-adjusted GDP climbed +0.6% against Q1's +0.9%. As we recently explained, Japanese economic data has been doing a lot of missing expectations lately. Industrial production, household spending and July PMI all fell short.  Plus, July employment fell for the first time in three months. Abe-nomics — the loose monetary policy ordered by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reinflate Japan's economy — have now been in place about half a year. Clearly, something's not working.
