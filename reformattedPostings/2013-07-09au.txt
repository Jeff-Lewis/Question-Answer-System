She noted that the global economic recovery was advancing at mainly three different speeds from an average 5.5% in emerging economies, to 2.0% in advanced countries like the US and Australia, to no growth in the dead-in-the-water economies of the euro zone. Lagarde said, “We therefore had a [global] growth forecast which was about 3.3%. But I am afraid when taking into account what we are currently seeing in the economies of the emerging countries in particular ... I am afraid that we are perhaps a little bit below.”  So why did S&amp;P 500 forward expected revenues rise to another record high at the end of June? Those expectations drive analysts’ estimates for forward earnings, which is also at a record high. These 500 companies generate at least half of their sales overseas.  A closer look at the revenues estimates shows that analysts are expecting relatively anemic growth of 2.3% this year and 4.3% next year. Those estimates actually are weaker than the IMF’s forecasts of nominal world GDP growth rates of 5%-6% this year and next year. Other global economic indicators confirm that record highs are being set, but at a relatively slow speed. Today's Morning Briefing: Three Speeds. (1) IMF chief sending smoke signals: Slower growth ahead.
