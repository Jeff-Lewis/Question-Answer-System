Getty Images/ Stephen LovekinIt's International Women's Day, so we're publishing our first ever list of the 25 most powerful women on Wall Street. For the list, we talked to several people on Wall Street to see whom they regarded as the most powerful. Some of them we selected ourselves.  A big thanks to Bloomberg TV and anchor Stephanie Ruhle who helped provide names.  Bloomberg TV "Market Makers" featured a bunch of these awesome ladies on-air today. If you feel we missed someone big, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com. We're always open to adding more women.  FREE AppDownload
