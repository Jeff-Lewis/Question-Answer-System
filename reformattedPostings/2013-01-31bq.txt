Wikimedia CommonsTo celebrate its 100th birthday, Grand Central Terminal restaurants and shops are having a crazy discount tomorrow. Participating retailers will be rolling their 2013 prices all the way back to 1913 costs on February 1st, which means if you stop by the station, you could get a 10¢ shoe shine or a loaf of rye bread for 6¢. (Unfortunately, the trains will still cost the same.) That won't be the only way the transportation hub will be celebrating. There will also be a Rededication Ceremony that day with Cynthia Nixon, Caroline Kennedy, and the Vanderbilt family, as well as music performances in the station by the Grammy Award-winning big band Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks. The terminal will also have a slew of other celebratory specials and parties throughout its centennial year, which will be posted on the Grand Central's website. The station opened officially to the public at midnight on February 2 in 1913, with more than 150,000 people in attendance to see the city's newest landmark. The New York Times even wrote of the day that, "Railroad men viewed the scene with amazement, saying that never before had the public been known to take such a keen interest in the opening of a railroad terminal." Here's the full list of the 1913 pricing rollbacks and participating stores (via the Gothamist). FREE AppDownload
