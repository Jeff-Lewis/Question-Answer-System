YouTube screenshotKen Griffin's wife has filed a response to his divorce petition asking the court to void the couple's prenuptial agreement, claiming she was rushed into signing it before their wedding, Crain's reports, citing the filing. Back in July, Griffin filed for divorce from his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias-Griffin, while she was on summer vacation with their three children. Griffin, 45, is the founder of the Chicago-based hedge fund giant Citadel LLC. Dias-Griffin, 43, was born in France. She is the founder of the hedge fund firm Aragon Global Management. Dias-Griffin is now seeking equitable division of their assets and sole custody of their children, the Crain's report said, citing the filing. She wants their prenup thrown out. CNBC/ Heidi GutmanAccording to Crain's, Dias-Griffin says she didn't receive a copy of the prenup until shortly before the wedding date, and she was busy with wedding plans and running her hedge fund firm. Dias-Griffin also said she told Griffin she didn't want to sign the prenup. This, according to Dias-Griffin's filing, led to an argument in which she said Griffin "destroyed a piece of furniture in their home." Dias-Griffin says Griffin got her to meet with a psychologist. According to Dias-Griffin, the psychologist sided with Griffin. She ended up signing the prenup three hours before the rehearsal dinner. Griffin's attorney maintains that the prenup is valid. He also told Crain's that Dias-Griffin's allegations were "simply untrue." Under the terms of the prenup, she says she will receive 1 percent of Griffin's assets. Griffin has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. Griffin and Dias-Griffin were married in Versailles in July 2003. This is the second divorce for Griffin. He divorced his first wife in 1994. FREE AppDownload
