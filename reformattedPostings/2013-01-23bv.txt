I monitor the 260-day moving sum of withheld income and employment taxes deposited at the US Treasury. It was $1,791 billion on December 18. It jumped $25 billion to $1,816 billion on January 18. That’s a significant tax increase, especially if it is annualized, that could depress real GDP at least during the first quarter. The Treasury’s monthly data show that individual income taxes totaled $1,174 billion last year, while payroll taxes totaled $847 billion. Both increased last year along with payrolls. Of course, the good news at the start of this year was that Congress voted to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of American taxpayers. That was offset by the bad news about the higher payroll tax rate. That would certainly explain why the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) slipped in January to the lowest reading since December 2011. Joining the recent downdraft in the overall CSI was its present situation component, which had risen to a cyclical high during November.Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Going Vertical.
