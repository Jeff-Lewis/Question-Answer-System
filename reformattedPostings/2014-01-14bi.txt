REUTERS/Caren FirouzStocks had a fantastic year in 2013, surging 30% even as earnings growth was quite modest. This discrepancy has more and more people freaked out that the stock market might be in a bubble. Yes, stock market valuations may be getting pricey. But Goldman Sachs' Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and Brett Nelson don't think stocks are in a bubble.

Mossavar-Rahmani and  Nelson told the firm's private wealth clients to "stay fully invested at their strategic allocation to U.S. equities." FREE AppDownload
