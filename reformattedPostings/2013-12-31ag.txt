Thanks in part to annual inflation of 56%, stocks climbed 480% in the socialist-run nation.  In November, President Nicholas Maduro called business owners in Venezuela "barbaric capitalist parasites" and accused them of price gouging. The business owners say failed socialist policies and restricted access to foreign reserves have made the Bolivar worthless. Dollars now sell for 64 Venezuelan bolivars on the black market. For what that's worth, it's been great for stocks. Here's the year-to-date chart of the Caracas Stock Exchange Stock Market Index via Bloomberg:  FREE AppDownload
