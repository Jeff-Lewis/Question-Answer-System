Official U.S. Navy Page/FlickrThe October Jobs Report is out, and it is much stronger than people had expected. Total non-farm payrolls came in at 204,000. That's well ahead of the 120,000 that was expected. Private payrolls were up 212K, which means that the public sector is still a bit of a drag on the labor picture. Critically, there were strong upward revisions to previous months that totaled 60,000. What's big about all this is that everyone expected October to be extremely weak with the government shutdown, and yet in all of the data, that weakness is not showing up. Stocks are falling on the news, as people think that the Fed's "taper" could come sooner than expected. Bonds and gold are both dropping as well, which is also consistent with expectations of the Fed moving sooner than expected. Here's the full report from the BLS.   FREE AppDownload
