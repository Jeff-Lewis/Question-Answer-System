FlickrToday's third and final revision of third-quarter GDP was a monster.  And the report showed that the economic recovery is being driven by real people actually buying stuff. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy surged 4.1% in the third quarter, which was much higher than the previous estimate of 3.6%. Economists are often quick to look at how inventories contributed to GDP. Indeed, last month saw a massive 1.7 percentage point contribution from inventory adjustments. So, real final sales — GDP growth less inventory changes — is considered a more reliable measure of economic health. Even this number looked good. Real final sales growth was revised up to 2.5% from last month's weak estimate of 1.9%. This was largely driven by personal consumption growth, which was revised up to 2.0% from 1.4%. Bloomberg Briefs economist Rich Yamarome has previously warned that a real final sales growth number below 2.0% portends a recession. Perhaps today's real final sales number suggests this recovery is for real. FREE AppDownload
