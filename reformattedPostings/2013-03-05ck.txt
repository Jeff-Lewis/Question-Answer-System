Times Higher Education has released its 2013 World Reputation Rankings, which are based on the world's largest invitation-only academic opinion survey "to provide the definitive list of the top 100 most powerful global university brands." Although the reputation rankings aren't as objective as their annual World University Rankings — which employs 13 carefully calibrated performance indicators — the brand evaluation is based on "the expert judgement of senior, published academics." Australia stepped up to the world stage as it now has six universities represented in the top 100 while the UK has lost three institutions from the world top 100 list since the first reputation rankings in 2011. In the U.S. the University of Massachusetts has fallen from 19th to 42nd since 2011 while John Hopkins dropped from 14th in 2011 to 19th this year. New York University has risen 29 from the 51-60 group in '11. Here's the top 10 (along with their overall score): The U.S. continues to dominate the list with 11 of the top 15 and 43 universities total (the next highest is the UK with nine total). Twenty countries are represented in the list:  The data allows tracking of individual universities over the years, which will be interesting to watch as as time progresses: Now Watch: The Secrets Of Superachievers Revealed // <![CDATA[OO.ready(function() { OO.Player.create('ooyalaplayer', 't4cjVrOToVeZeXPLA6EJSKfwD61HyUMV'); });// ]]>&lt;div&gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&lt;/div&gt;                                                                        Check out&nbsp;                    the entire list                 FREE AppDownload
