Bar BrunoCinco de Mayo is this Sunday, which gives us all an excuse to down some tequila shots and margaritas before it's even 2 PM. So in anticipation of the May 5th celebration, we took an office poll and made a list of 12 of our favorite margaritas around NYC. Some of these are fruity, some are crazy strong, and still others are classically delicious with fresh lime juice and the very best Tequila. Did we miss a great one?
