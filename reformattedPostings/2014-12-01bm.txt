This is weird: Apple suddenly tanked this morning, falling as much as 6.4%. The stock has since bounced back, fluctuating all over the place, but it's currently down ~3%. According to Bloomberg news, this was the biggest intraday fall since Jan. 28. According to Reuters, this was the largest one-minute volume of trading since Oct. 29.  We have no idea what's going on here. There was no major Apple news to swing the stock like this.  Yahoo Finance FREE AppDownload
