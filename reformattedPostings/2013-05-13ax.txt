Wikimedia CommonsThe Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams are happening on June 1.   Consisting of three levels, they are considered to be the most difficult exams taken by Wall Streeters with fewer than 20 percent of candidates passing all three tests on the first try. What's more is the average test-taker spends a solid five to six months preparing, so you can imagine those taking the June exam are in crunch mode. We talked to a CFA charterholder, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, about things he didn't think he needed to know for the exams.  We've included the concepts he totally blew off.   Disclaimer: We don't claim to be an expert in offering exam advice.   FREE AppDownload
