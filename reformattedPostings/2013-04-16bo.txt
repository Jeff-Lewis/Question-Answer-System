Sotheby's International RealtyThe family summer compound purchased by a former President of Ally Financial (then-General Motors Acceptance Corp.) in 1927 is being sold for $10 million, says the WSJ. Grandson Davi Shuman said the Madison, Conn. property wasn't "appropriate" for his family every more. What the 21 bedroom property is ideal for, however, is a large extended family. It boasts 500 yards of private beach, a cottage, two houses, a tennis court, heated swimming pool and perhaps room for yet another house. Sotheby's International's Margaret Muir has the listing.
