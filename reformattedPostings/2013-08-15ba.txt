APRep. Tom McClintock just made some friends on Wall Street. Because financial misconduct is only criminal if a gun is involved, according to the California Republican. ThinkProgress dug up this video of McClintock's recent town hall meeting where a constituent asks the congressman for his "stance on Wall Street criminal practices." McClintock begins, "Well first of all, for a criminal practice, there has to be a gun. It's pretty simple." Though, the congressman went on to decry bank bailouts, and added that individual financial decisions — smart or otherwise — are “the price we pay for the freedom to make all of the good decisions in our lives.” Watch the video:  FREE AppDownload
