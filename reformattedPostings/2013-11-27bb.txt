The value of one Bitcoin has surpassed $1,000 on the Mt. Gox exchange. It's actually now at $1,030. Bitcoin's popularity has surged this month as demand from China picked up, and the digital currency received broad coverage as it underwent two days of Senate hearings. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also issued a statement saying digital currencies like Bitcoin "may hold long term promise." Though he was referring more to the innovations in payment processing being ushered in — he did not endorse Bitcoin itself, nor did he suggest the future of commerce lay in virtual money. Yesterday, we reported how the value of SecondMarket's Bitcoin Trust exploded $50 million.  Gold, meanwhile, is at $1,248. clarkmoody FREE AppDownload
