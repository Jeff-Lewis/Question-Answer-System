REUTERS/Tobias SchwarzJanuary U.S. industrial production data are out. Industrial production unexpectedly fell 0.3% in January. Economists were expecting a 0.2% rise. Capacity utilization slipped to 78.5% from December's downward-revised 78.9% reading. Economists expected it to tick up to 79.3% from the prior 79.2% December estimate. Manufacturing production tumbled 0.8%, missing estimates for a 0.1% gain and marking the worst drop since 2009. Unseasonally cold weather played a role in the setback, according to the release. Below are a few sentences from the report highlighting weather concerns: If much of the weakness reflects bad weather, the setback may prove to be only temporary. "Industrial production usually bounces back after a period of bad weather, as postponed orders are completed," says Paul Dales, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "With the weather having been just as severe in February, however, this may not happen until March. But it will happen eventually. After all, the fundamentals have not changed. The outlooks for the domestic and global economies are still better than for some time." Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial, has a different take. "It is hard to determine how much January weakness will be reversed when the weather improves," says Morelock. "However, the downward revision to Q4 manufacturing growth may be an early sign demand was already slowing even before 2014 began. Automotive production was one of the biggest contributors to GDP in 2013, but a slowdown in this sector could prove harmful in 2014." Click here for the full release » FREE AppDownload
