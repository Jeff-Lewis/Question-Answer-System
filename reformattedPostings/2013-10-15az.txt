Forget phones, TVs, cars, and watches—bring on the connected home! Two years ago Nest CEO Tony Fadell blew everyone away by crossing a home thermostat with a smartphone. Cool! Now he’s targeting all the rest of “the ugly white plastic crap” controlling most living spaces, from the front door to the bedroom TV. Nest’s gorgeous design, native connectivity, and game-changing ambition are no accident: Fadell's previous gig was leading the Apple engineering A-team that built the iPod and iPhone. That’s what we look for in selecting speakers for IGNITION: Future of Digital: a killer combination of high concept and over-delivery. Here’s what else we’ll have on tap: three amazing days of smart talk, cool demos, and extended conversations. IGNITION will be being held Nov. 11-13  at the top of New York’s Time Warner Center. Speakers include: We'll also tackle content marketing, life after cookies, socializing television, mobile commerce, wearable computing, and really big data. More than 85 speakers, doing up-close interviews, rousing roundtables, and live demos. Tesla cars! Amazing Central Park views! And—yes, we’re listening—more networking breaks.
