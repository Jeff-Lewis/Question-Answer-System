Wikimedia CommonsGoldman Sachs recently released its new "Hedge Fund Trend Monitor," giving clients a glimpse into the investment moves and strategies by 708 of the world's biggest funds. In the report, Goldman lays out the 20 most "concentrated" stocks, meaning a large share of their market capitalization is owned in aggregate by hedge funds. In upward trending markets, buying these 20 stocks has been a successful strategy. Less so in a "choppy or flat" market. From the report: The “most concentrated” stocks lagged for most of 2007 and 2008, but significantly outperformed in 2009 (81.4% vs. 26.5%) and 2010 (15.9% vs. 15.1%). Our “most concentrated” basket underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 391 bp in 2011 (-1.8% vs. 2.1%) but outperformed by 814 bp in 2012 (24.1% vs. 16.0%). We ranked the stocks based on the percentage of equity cap owned by hedge funds and included the three funds with the largest stake. FREE AppDownload
