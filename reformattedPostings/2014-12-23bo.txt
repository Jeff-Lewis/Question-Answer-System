Shutterstock.comNew home sales fell 1.6% in November to an annualized pace of 438,000 units. Economists were expecting a level of 460,000 units. Sales dropped 12% in the Northeast, 6.3% in the Midwest, and 6.4% in the South. However, they rose 14.8% in the West. "We have seen both existing and pending home sales lose a bit of steam recently, as well," BNP Paribas' Derek Lindsey reminded. The median new home sales price during the month was $280,900. According to the Census, there were 213,000 new houses for sale, which represents a supply of 5.8 months at the current sales rate. "On balance, soft November new home sales are consistent with what has been a slow and choppy recovery in the housing sector, and we look for further stabilization in coming quarters," Barclays' Jesse Hurwitz said.
