Dr. Ed's BlogThe combination of the recent weakness of forward earnings with the record-breaking performance of stocks has boosted forward P/Es significantly since mid-October. Here are the year’s peaks, mid-October lows, and Friday’s readings of the forward P/Es for the S&amp;P 500 (15.7, 14.4, 15.7), S&amp;P 400 (17.7, 15.3, 16.9), and S&amp;P 600 (19.3, 15.8, 17.6). The S&amp;P 500 seems especially expensive relative to forward revenues. The same can be said for Q3’s ratio of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 to its aggregate’s revenues. The ratio rose to 1.66, the highest since Q1-2002. I suppose valuation multiples can continue to go higher now that we have the Kuroda Put.
