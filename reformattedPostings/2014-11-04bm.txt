Dartmouth College faculty members overwhelmingly voted to support a motion to end the Ivy League school's controversial fraternity and sorority system at a meeting Monday, student newspaper The Dartmouth reports. The faculty vote follows a front page editorial in The Dartmouth during the college's Homecoming Weekend last month that called for an end to Greek life on campus. The newspaper's staff wrote that "Greek life is not the root of all the College's problems or of broader societal ills ... as a system, it amplifies students' worst behavior." According to The Dartmouth, the faculty voted 116-13 to end the Greek system, with three abstentions. Additionally, The Dartmouth reports, "A letter calling for abolishing the Greek system that circulated among faculty members late last month attracted 232 signatures." However, the voting numbers may be misleading, as Dartmouth alumnus Joseph Asch notes at Dartblog — only faculty members who attend the meeting have the ability to vote. It's likely that the faculty that chooses to attend a meeting about the Greek system would have stronger feelings about the outcome. Dartmouth's Greek system received some negative attention earlier this year with the publication of former Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity member Andrew Lohse's book, "Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy." In his book, Lohse details his time in a Dartmouth fraternity, revealing hazing practices and other disturbing behavior. There is no immediate impact from the faculty vote, according to The Dartmouth. FREE AppDownload
