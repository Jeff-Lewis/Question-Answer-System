"Following the first quarter’s surprising 2.9% decline in GDP, we are looking for a nice rebound in Q2," Wells Fargo's John Silvia said. "Perhaps even more notably, personal consumption expenditures grew at an initially reported 3.0% pace, but the figure was revised down to only 1.0%. While the decline in Q1 GDP was rather discouraging, economic indicators thus far in Q2 have been much more upbeat. While we still see net exports putting a drag on economic growth, inventory-building should provide a boost in Q2." At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve was set to publish its latest Federal Open Market Committee statement. Economists don't expect much, but they will be reading carefully for clues to when the Fed might start raising rates. FREE AppDownload
