Oil got crushed Tuesday. Then it bounced Wednesday morning. Now, amid a broad market sell-off, with the Dow off over 200 points, oil is selling off hard again. Here's a multiday chart, via FinViz, that puts things into perspective — both Tuesday's severe sell-off and Wednesday's.

There are multiple theories for the decline in commodities. A slowdown in China is one popular theory to explain the sell-off. The European slowdown (which has been exacerbated by Russia tensions) is also a culprit. Also Tuesday there was news that oil produced in key countries (including LIBYA) was more than expected.
