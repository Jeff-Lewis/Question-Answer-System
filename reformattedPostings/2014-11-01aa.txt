The CEOs on the Inc. 500, an annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies, are as savvy as entrepreneurs come, so it's no surprise then that in our annual survey, a majority (87 percent) of them said they rely on the career network LinkedIn, or that 63 percent keep a social media expert on payroll. With companies such as Google, Apple, and Elon Musk-led Tesla on their radar, it's clear that this year's class of chief execs are keenly interested in staying on top of tech trends. Among the revealing stats: nearly half of the CEOs surveyed (46 percent) said cloud computing will transform their business the most, while 43 percent expect 3-D printing to shake things up. Which will win out? Only time will tell, but Inc. entrepreneur of the year and Box CEO Aaron Levie probably has some opinions on the subject.  Check out the graphic below to see where Inc. 500 CEOs stand on technology. Inc FREE AppDownload
