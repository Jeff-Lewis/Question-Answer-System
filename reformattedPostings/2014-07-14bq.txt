REUTERS/ Keith BedfordCitigroup just beat second quarter earning estimates. For the second quarter, the bank reported adjusted EPS of $1.24. According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, the bank was expected to post adjusted EPS of $1.06. Revenue came in at $19.375, which was lower than the first quarter but higher that analysts' expectations. Revenue for Q2 was expected to come in at $18.81 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. This morning, the bank said it agreed to a $7 billion settlement over an investigation related to the firm's mortgage practices. "Despite the significant impact of today’s settlement on our net income, our capital position strengthened to an estimated Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.6% on a Basel III basis, and our tangible book value increased," Citi CEO Michael Corbat said in the release. Also during Q2, the bank reduced its headcount from 149,000 to 145,000. A chart from the bank shows that they would like to be under 145,000 by the fourth quarter of 2014. The stock was last trading up more than 3% in the pre-market.
