Wikimedia CommonsThe basic concept of "currency wars" is that countries are all trying to weaken their currencies to boost exports. "Wars" is an overly dramatic word to use, but countries to complain about other countries engaging in currency weakening, and it does make for a good soundbite. Anyway, Citi's currency guru Steven Englander has an interesting note out about who inevitably "wins" these wars, and the answer is similar to that of real wars: the rich countries. As he puts it, they win because they're indifferent to the consequences. He lists several reasons why. We summarize. Anyway, some interesting food for thought as you think about the dynamics, and you think about who's doing the "currency wars" complaining. And though the phrase originally originated from Brazil (and seems to be popular in China as well) the latest round of complaining comes from Germany towards Japan, so it's not just a poor vs. rich thing.
