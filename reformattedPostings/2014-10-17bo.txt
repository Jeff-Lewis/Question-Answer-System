wonderlane / FlickrHousing starts rose 6.3% in September to an annualized pace of 1.02 million. Expectations were for starts to rebound some, growing 5.4% month over month to an annualized rate of just over 1 million after last month's disappointing report. Building permits rose 1.5% to an annualized rate of 1.02 million from last month's revised level of 1.003 million. Building permits were expected to jump 2.7% month-over-month after last month's 5.6% decline. Last month's report from Census showed that starts plunged 14.4% to an annualized rate of 956,000, well below the expected decline of 5.2% to an annualized pace of 1.04 million.  Last month's housing starts rate was revised up slightly to 957,000. In a note to clients following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Details less impressive than the headline." Shepherdson added: "Almost all the increase in starts is in the hyper-volatile multi-family sector — up 16.7% in Sep after a 28.7% plunge in August — while single-family starts rose a trivial 7K. Given the fragility of the markets, though, what matters right now is the headline print. All the rise in permits was in multi-family, with single-family down slightly. The underlying trends in both single- and multi-family permits, which lead starts, are flat, and while the drop in mortgage rates likely will prompt stronger home sales by the turn of the year, we don't expect a significant upward trend in construction to re-emerge until next spring."
