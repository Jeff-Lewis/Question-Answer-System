Jim Edwards / BIA peek inside our new London office. There's lots of light and good company!Business Insider is opening a newsroom in London this summer and we're immediately looking to hire paid interns! These talented folks will have the exciting opportunity to build a brand from the ground up. As an intern at Business Insider, there's no getting coffee, filing, or making copies. BI Interns spend their time doing meaningful work: researching, writing, pitching and producing features. You'll get an author byline for every post you write.  We’re looking for interns who are ambitious, smart, funny, fast, and consume huge amounts of digital media. You should be comfortable working on multiple stories per day and building your own audience and personal brand through social media. When it comes to qualifications, a journalism background and experience writing for a news site with a focus on finance, tech, and politics, always helps. Light HTML and Photoshop experience, and knowledge of social media (are you super active on Twitter?) is useful, too. If you are interested in applying for a paid internship position at Business Insider U.K., please send us your resume and tell us, in no more than five sentences, why we should hire you. And, please note: this internship requires that you live in the U.K. and work in our London office, located near the Old Street tube station. Interns are encouraged to work full-time (40 hours a week) for a six-month period from the start date. FREE AppDownload
