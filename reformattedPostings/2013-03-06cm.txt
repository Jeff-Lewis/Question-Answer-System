On Friday, of course, we get the Non-Farm Payrolls Report ("The Jobs Report"). Analysts expect about 165K new jobs. Tomorrow we get initial claims data.

The consensus is for 173K new private sector jobs, according to Calculated Risk. Check back at these pages at 8:15 AM ET for the number. FREE AppDownload
