Flickr / LaRezistanceLatsi Harbour, CyprusThe big event of the day: Cypriot banks are set to reopen at 6 AM ET. To what extent it appears that there's a run/panic is something people will closely watch, although that might just make for good drama, rather than market-moving data. In the meantime, markets are lower everywhere. The big Japanese rally has really stalled out, with the Nikkei falling 1.26%. Shanghai got clubbed last night, dropping 2.8%. US futures are a  tad lower, and European equities are a little lower as well. There's some good economic data in the US today: GDP revisions, Chicago PMI and initial jobless claims are all coming up. FREE AppDownload
