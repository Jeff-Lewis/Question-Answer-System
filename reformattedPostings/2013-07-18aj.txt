Outspoken NBA hall of fame member Sir Charles Barkley joined CNBC's Maria Bartiromo on the "Closing Bell" for a tremendous interview.  We've included some of his insights on jobs, the market and life below. He also weighed in on the George Zimmerman trial and agreed that he should have been acquitted.  On the only jobs in the world that count:  "Well, Maria, no disrespect to you. There's only five real jobs in the world — teacher, farmer, policemen, doctor and somebody's who's in the armed service. Everybody else can just shut the hell up and enjoy life. You know, I think those five jobs are really important and significant. If you don't have one of those jobs, you shouldn't take yourself that serious." On investing in the market and protecting your wealth:  Barkley: "I do have money in this market. The key, when you have money, I'm not bragging just blessed to have money, you probably want to risk only 20, 25% of it. You know 70% you just want to put in safe stuff. You know 70% of professional athletes go broke."    FREE AppDownload
