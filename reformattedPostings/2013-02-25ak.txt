Leonard Riggio, the founder of Barnes &amp; Noble, wants to buy back a slice of the bookseller he founded more than 40 years ago. But he doesn't want anything to do with the Nook — just the stores and website. So, what's the Barnes &amp; Noble retail arm actually worth? By some measures, Barnes &amp; Noble's retail business may be worth "virtually nothing," Michael J. De La Merced at DealBook reported. The overall company is valued at around $863 million and its total enterprise value is about $1.3 billion, according to S&amp;P's Capital IQ. In 2012, Microsoft and Pearson bought a 23 percent chunk of the Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook division last year, which valued it at nearly $1.8 billion. Obviously, Barnes &amp; Noble won't just chuck its retail division away to its founder for free. It has nearly 700 stores and an e-commerce business. But will it be able to sell it at a decent price?
