During a down week in the market, ETF issuers iShares and ProShares both filed paperwork with the SEC to add more funds to their already successful portfolios. With ProShares focusing on creating eight new funds for the purest way to play credit default swaps (CDSs) and iShares expanding its corporate term ETFs with four new funds, this fall may see a number of new options for ETF investors [see ETF Database Launch Center]. ProShares is looking to grow its portfolio with new CDS ETFs focusing on both North American and European credit risk through investment grade and high yield issues.
