The Munich-based Ifo think tank's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 106.3 from 108.0. The Reuters consensus forecast had been for a decrease to 107.0.  It was the lengthiest period of decline since the height of the euro zone crisis in summer 2012 and sent the euro to a day's low against the dollar.
