VW is seeking to cut 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) of costs by 2017 at its main car division where profit margins have languished amid a proliferation of models. Some of the improvements should come through efficiencies and leaner management and include, for example, cutting back management meetings, said the person, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. Winterkorn spoke to around 2,000 VW managers in the German city of Dresden at a closed-door strategy conference on Thursday.
