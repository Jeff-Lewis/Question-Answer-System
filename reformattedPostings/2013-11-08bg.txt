Getty ImagesThe preliminary results of the University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey are out. The headline index unexpectedly fell to 72.0 in November from October's 73.2 reading. Economists expected it to bounce back to 74.5 after getting slammed in October by the government shutdown. The economic conditions sub-index fell to 87.2 from October's 89.9 reading. The economic outlook sub-index fell to 62.3 from 62.5. Inflation expectations one year ahead edged up to 3.1% from 3.0%, while inflation expectations five years ahead edged up to 2.9% from 2.8%. "The survey breakdown also shows buying intentions suffering during the month, with home purchase expectations slipping further to 148K from 156K and auto purchase expectations falling to 123 from 136," says TD Securities strategist Gennadiy Goldberg. "Durable purchase expectations also edged to 135 from 136, though this index already saw a notable slip in October from 143 in September. We believe that the deceleration in purchase expectations is worrying as a protracted period of lower consumer confidence could weigh further on Q4 economic growth, forecasts of which are already being revised lower due to slowing consumer spending momentum in Q3."
