Female pop music star Miley Cyrus hosted this season's second episode of "Saturday Night Live." The sketch comedy show committed plenty of time to the government shutdown.

Sadly, one could easily argue that the video isn't as nonsensical as the fact that the government has been shut down because of Congress' inability to negotiate a budget deal. Watch here. Some images are disturbing and not safe for work:  FREE AppDownload
