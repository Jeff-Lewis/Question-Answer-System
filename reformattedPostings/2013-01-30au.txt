From Josh Brown, aka The Reformed Broker, a heart-wrenching video featuring a Wall Streeter down on his luck and forced to pan handle in the NYC Subway. People beg because they have needs. At 1:15 we find out what a desperate banker needs from his fellow MTA patrons. He enters the subway car saying: Alright d--- heads listen up! My taxes are through the roof, I didn't get my bonus this year, I can't even pay off my Ferrari. Somebody's paying the piper. It's payback time I pay taxes for you.
