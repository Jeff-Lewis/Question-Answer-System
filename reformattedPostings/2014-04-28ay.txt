The model has been more useful for explaining corporate financial behavior. The corporate finance yield spread between the S&amp;P 500 forward earnings yield and Moody’s seasoned Aaa corporate bond yield has been positive since 2004 and is currently 237bps. When it is positive, company managements can get a better return on their cash by repurchasing their shares than by investing it in fixed-income securities. Alternatively, their companies can benefit by borrowing the money to buy back some of the company shares. Last year, nonfinancial corporations’ net new issuance of bonds totaled a record $640 billion. Some of those proceeds funded buybacks. (Although the Aaa yield applies to only a handful of corporations, it is pre-tax. So it should still be a good proxy for corporate borrowing rates after taxes, in my opinion.) The corporate finance version of the FSVM suggests that companies can also benefit by using their cash or borrowed money to fund M&amp;A when the forward earnings yield of the combination exceeds the corporate bond yield.  Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: M&amp;A Mania?
