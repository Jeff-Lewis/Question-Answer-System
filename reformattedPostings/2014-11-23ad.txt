Chances are, the answer is yes. But did you know how much work went into creating that bill? It's likely more than you ever expected. Hundreds of hours of labor go into making a dollar bill, from the special process used to create the paper it's printed on, to the printing, analyzing, cutting, packaging, and shipping to banks. Each bill must be perfect, according to the US Department of Treasury's standards, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which is tasked with creating all paper money, goes to great lengths to meet its specifications. Go behind the scenes at the BEP's Washington, DC facilities to see how dollars get made.
