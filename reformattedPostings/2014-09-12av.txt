Associated Press.Olive Garden stopped salting its water for pasta so that its pots would last longer. The Italian-restaurant chain supposedly breaks a basic rule of Italian cooking — salting the pasta water.  "Shockingly, Olive Garden no longer salts the water it uses to boil the pasta, merely to get a longer warranty on its pots," Starboard writes in its 300-slide presentation. "This appalling decision shows just how little regard management has for delivering a quality experience to guests." We reached out to Olive Garden for comment but haven't heard back. The company's website confirms that the pasta contains a negligible amount of sodium until you add sauce or meat.  This Starboard slide points out that "the first step of Pasta 101 is to salt the water."  Starboard According to Smithsonian Magazine, adding salt to the water gives the pasta a better flavor. "Do as Mario Batali does and salt the water until it 'tastes like the sea,'" the magazine instructs. Starboard believes that Olive Garden should focus on offering authentic Italian cuisine.  The brand's new menu items this year have included Spanish tapas and a burger.    FREE AppDownload
