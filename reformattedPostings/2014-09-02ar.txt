Flickr/BigTallGuyHome Depot may be the latest victim of a massive data breach. According to Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security, "Multiple banks say they are seeing evidence that Home Depot stores may be the source of a massive new batch of stolen credit and debit cards that went on sale this morning in the cybercrime underground."  Krebs said "there are signs" this breach at Home Depot could've been carried out by the same group of Russian and Ukrainian hackers that stole data from Target and P.F. Chang's.  It wasn't immediately clear how many stores have been impacted, but Krebs did say, "preliminary analysis indicates the breach may extend across all 2,200 Home Depot stores in the United States." In a e-mailed statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, Home Depot spokesperson Paula Drake said: "At this point, I can confirm that we’re looking into some unusual activity and we are working with our banking partners and law enforcement to investigate.  Protecting our customers’ information is something we take extremely seriously, and we are aggressively gathering facts at this point while working to protect customers.  If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately. Right now, for security reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to speculate further. We will provide further information as soon as possible." Home Depot shares fell 2% on Tuesday.
