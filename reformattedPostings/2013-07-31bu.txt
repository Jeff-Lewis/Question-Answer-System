It looks like the Treasury market is taking the threat of a September tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve more seriously this morning after two better-than-expected economic data releases. Right now, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is 8 basis points higher at 2.69%, the highest level in weeks. ADP's monthly employment report, released at 8:15 AM, estimated that 200,000 private payrolls were created in the U.S. economy in the month of June. Economists were only looking for 180,000. The first reading of Q2 GDP, out at 8:30, revealed that the economy expanded 1.7% at an annualized pace in the second quarter. The number topped the consensus estimate of 1.0% growth. Treasuries sold off sharply on both releases. Since, the market has stabilized a bit, but is starting to roll over again. Now, the market is on track for its biggest down day since the sell-off following the last jobs report release on July 5. Friday, we get the next jobs report, so the fireworks could continue depending on the outcome. The chart below shows 5-year U.S. Treasury futures. Thinkorswim FREE AppDownload
