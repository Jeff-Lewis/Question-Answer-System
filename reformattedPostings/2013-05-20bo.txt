In the past, Bernanke explicitly stated that his ultra-easy monetary policy is aimed at driving stock prices higher. Now that they are at record highs, his recent cheerleading could contribute to a melt-up, just as Alan Greenspan did during the second half of the 1990s. We all know how that ended. Greenspan, who was Fed Chairman from August 1987 to January 2006, was a big believer in the high-tech revolution during the second half of the 1990s. His last major speech about this subject was titled “Technology and the economy,” on January 13, 2000. Just as technology stocks were about to crash, he said: “When we look back at the 1990s, from the perspective of say 2010, the nature of the forces currently in train will have presumably become clearer. We may conceivably conclude from that vantage point that, at the turn of the millennium, the American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation, which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits, and stock prices at a pace not seen in generations, if ever.” Subsequently, Greenspan said that the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a “once-in-a-century event,” i.e., the Lehman bankruptcy! Let’s hope that Bernanke won’t regret his latest speech. The S&amp;P 500 is now 6.5% above its previous record high on October 9, 2007. The current bull market seemed to be tracking the previous one (from 2003-2007), raising concerns that 2013 could play out as badly as did 2007. Now the two bull markets are diverging with the current one rising to new highs. It’s much easier now to make the case that the market may be just starting a melt-up, as I discussed last week.  Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Ahead of Schedule. (1) From 666 to 1667.
