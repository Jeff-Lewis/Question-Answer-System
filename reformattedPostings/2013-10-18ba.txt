This post is sponsored by OppenheimerFunds. Today's investors are faced with a number of options — many of which are probably best explored with the help of a financial advisor. We're now pleased to present the first part of our series, addressing the question, "How can I tell if my portfolio has the right balance of growth, income, and protection*?"

Investing in certain securities may help to hedge against certain risks, but does not imply any guarantee from loss. Mutual funds are subject to market risk and volatility.
