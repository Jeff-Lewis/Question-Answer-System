Intrigue, mystery.... Activist investor Carl Icahn just tweeted this cryptic message. Twitter Icahn has been a big holder of Apple shares, and he's agitated for more money to be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks and higher dividends. CNBC's Scott Wapner is reporting that whatever it is, his son Brett and Dave Schechter will be involved. They'll all be on Wapner's show 'Halftime Report' tomorrow at noon.  Don't be surprised if they tout that, in a recent filing, Icahn Enterprises announced that the portfolio Brett Icahn and Schechter manage is up 36.5% since its launch in April 2010, and now has $6.6 billion assets under management as of the end of last September. Icahn has won a meeting in the past with Tim Cook, and although Apple has increased its dividend, it's not to the level that Icahn has wanted. Anyway, we'll find out tomorrow what it's all about!
