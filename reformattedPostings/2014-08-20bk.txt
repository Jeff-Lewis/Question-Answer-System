New York City is the billionaire-breeding capital of the world, according to a new report from Spear's and WealthInsight. Fifty-two billionaires have been born in the Big Apple, totaling 3.09% of all billionaires on the planet. Moscow came in second, while London came in third. Courtesy of Spear's The above map is actually a better indicator of "billionaire hives" six decades ago, rather than today, because the average billionaire is 63, WealthInsight's Oliver Williams told Spear's. While some cities on the ranking, like New York and London, still continue to mint wealthy individuals, others, like Detroit and Pittsburgh, rarely do. In 2012, 70 billionaires lived in New York City, more than in any other city. Moscow and London also count large numbers of billionaires among their current ranks. A study from Spear's and WealthInsight from earlier this summer found that one in every 21 New Yorkers is a millionaire. That's 4.63% of the population. The No. 1 city, Monaco, has nearly 3 in 10.  FREE AppDownload
