The Old Fashioned was a popular cocktail in the 1960s but nearly forgotten over the years. The drink came back to the spotlight with the premier of "Mad Men" in 2007 as the Old Fashioned was the cocktail of choice for the show's lead character Don Draper.  For an easy-to-make at home bourbon cocktail recipe, we turned to the drink masters at Ward III in New York City.
