I’m generally a pretty optimistic person.  I adhere to the belief that human beings are naturally progressive and most of us wake up in the morning saying “I am going to be better than I was yesterday”.  And that mentality, over the long-term, creates a very difficult hurdle for pessimists. If you’ve ever looked at the performance of a short only fund over the course of a decade then you know what I mean.  Shorting human progress is a very very difficult way to live your life. There is a risk, however, in this very optimistic view of the world.  And if you’re not aware of it it can be the cause of unnecessary hardship.  The following are a few of the risks to this view that you should always be aware of: I’m all for optimism.  But be aware of the risks of an overly optimistic view of the world.  I always say that we should be pragmatic optimists.    Maintain an optimistic bias, but be aware of the potential near-term risks.
