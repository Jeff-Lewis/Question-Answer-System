Nevada, which had for five consecutive years posted the nation's highest foreclosure rate, fell to second place. Both were above the national average foreclosure rate of one in every 72 homes receiving a foreclosure filing . On a monthly basis Florida posted the highest rate in September. "Florida is in more trouble than the northeast because the volume of foreclosures was so overwhelming, and the number of foreclosures that we're talking about are more likely to hurt that market," Daren Blomquist vice president at RealtyTrac told Business Insider. "On the other side there, in some markets of Florida there are some good underlying fundamentals that we're starting to see. Especially in Miami just really strong demand from home buyers. People want to move in Florida. Buy in Florida it always has that going for it. Even foreign buyers and unemployment has come down."
