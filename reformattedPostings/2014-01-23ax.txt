But this year's Super Bowl — featuring the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos — has an even more awesome list of things you can bet that are ancillary to the game itself. Unsurprisingly, a few of the bets involve Richard Sherman, who started a media frenzy with a wild post-game interview in the NFC championship. The oddsmakers at Bovada have over 500 novelty bets (or "props") for the Super Bowl.
