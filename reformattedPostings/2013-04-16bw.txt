NBC NewsRick DesLauriersIn a wide-ranging press conference that offered little new hard details on the Boston Marathon bombings, FBI Special Agent Rick DesLauriers pledged that the U.S. will go to "the ends of the Earth" to identify those responsible for the attacks. "This will be a worldwide investigation," DesLauriers said. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said that more than 150 people have been injured in the bombings, including three confirmed dead. He also also immediately dismissed reports that more undetonated devices had been found after the attacks — comments that were echoed by ATF official Gene Marquez. It was a press conference that was at-times emotional, as Boston Mayor Thomas Menino — speaking from a wheelchair after a recent leg fracture — declared that "Boston will overcome." "Yesterday, terror was brought to the city of Boston," Menino said. "This is a tragedy, but Boston is a strong city," Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that the investigation was the most complex the Boston PD had ever undertaken. "We are in the process of securing the most complex crime scene in the history of our department," Davis said. Overall, little new information has emerged about the explosions over the past 10 hours. Late last night, police reportedly searched a home in Revere, Mass., a suburb of Boston. The Revere Fire Department wrote on its Facebook page that its firefighters responded to the scene in connection with a "person of interest," along with multiple law enforcement agencies that included the FBI. DesLauriers had little new information, saying that the investigation is ongoing and that there were no new known additional threats. DesLauriers also wouldn't comment on any materials used in the bombs or whether the FBI had anyone in custody. "I'm not going to say who might or might be in custody right now," he said. But Davis later said that "no one is in custody." FREE AppDownload
