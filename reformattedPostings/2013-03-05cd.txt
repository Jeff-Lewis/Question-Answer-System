Despite the news, we’ve seen higher levels of hiring activity than ever at TheLadders. As I mentioned last week when I shared 100 of the most recent hires made on TheLadders, we’ve got more HR Professionals and Executive Recruiters active on our website than ever before in our history. And with that, here are fifty of our employers that are looking to hire professionals like you right now… MicrosoftPwCCitiCapital OneADPVerizonIntelAmazonBaxterCSCMetlifeChryslerHome DepotKforce Inc.Level 3 CommunicationsNuanceSears Holdings Management CorporationCoventry Health CareGentiva Health ServicesEmeritus Senior LivingLife TechnologiesHPGentivaUnitedHealth GroupArrow ElectronicsAmerigroupPacific Dental ServicesTechprosAvanadeCVS CaremarkLucas GroupQuintilesUnisysUSAAPitney BowesAon HewittIngram MicroFinancial Services CompanyCrowe HorwathJohnson Controls, IncAmeripriseCompliance Search GroupRGPNovo NordiskUPSVisiting Nurse Service of New YorkEverbankKellogg CompanyLivingSocialGentiva Health You might ask: how can that be? With the unemployment rate still so high for this point in a recovery, and the discouragement rate even higher, how can it be that so many companies are hiring so many people? Well, it’s two things, Readers. First off, you have to remember that most hiring is replacement hiring. It’s not companies saying that they’re going to grow their workforce by leaps and bounds, rather, it’s companies replacing routine attrition that occurs as employees flow in and out of any organization. Think of it this way. Even though the level in your bank account probably doesn’t change too much in a particular year, and you may be more or less happy with where it is, a lot of new dollars come into your account each year from your current job. And then those dollars go out as expenses. So the vast majority of activity in your bank account is the addition of dollars to replace the ones you’ve already spent, even if the overall level stays about the same. Same thing in the employment market. We may be more or less happy with the overall rate of employment or unemployment, but the changeover from new employees coming in and old employees going out is far, far more important to your job search than the overall level. Therefore: most hiring is replacement hiring. Which means that most companies are hiring all the time. Second, some companies are always expanding. There are always sectors of the economy that are growing while others shrink. As an example, if your company has anything to do with Apple Inc. right now, you’re growing. And that’s whether or not your company has anything to do whatsoever with technology. If you sell cardboard boxes to Apple, you’re growing. If you sell real estate maintenance to Apple, you’re growing. If you sell the little plastic biodegradable forks that the geniuses who design iPads use to eat their arugula salads at their gorgeous headquarters… guess what? …you’re growing. So part of the job search is figuring out where’s the growth and where’s the shrink, and allocating your time accordingly. With that, I’ll wish you the best of luck in your search this week, Readers! I’ll be rooting for you. Read more posts on TheLadders » FREE AppDownload
