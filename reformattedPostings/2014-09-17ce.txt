REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlinRobert ShillerWellesley College economist Karl Case wrote a lovely, albeit lengthy, poem about the housing bubble to his long-time research partner and Nobel Prize winner, Robert Shiller. The poem was presented at a conference honoring Shiller at Yale University. In the past, Shiller and Case worked together to create the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes, which track the changes in US home prices. Using these indexes, Shiller was able to predict that home prices would collapse. The poem was originally reprinted in the Wall Street Journal. We have reprinted the poem here with Professor Case's permission. Reflection on the Housing Market: Seven Years After the FallBy Karl E. Case For the last dozen years we have shed many tears Living through a recession The world was broke and it was not a joke When we talked of another depression Fifteen million without a job Foreclosures and banks that fail 401k’s became 201k’s And everything’s up for sale How could it be? What didn’t we see That led to all of this trouble? There is little doubt that the proximal cause Was a bursting housing bubble But other than that who can we blame? And what do they lament? Millions of people contributed to This hundred year event   For me it began in ’76 With a house on Cleveland Road At 54 thousand, I thought it a lot, For a small three-bedroom abode But 10 years later that very same house Would sell for five times the price I was glad that I bought … I remember the thought “This may not be fair but it’s nice”   In Boston alone, that boom created 100 billion in wealth We spent more, saved less, and I have to confess It was good for our mental health We had to know that it couldn’t go on Someday prices would fall We knew there were risks – to ourselves and our fiscs If those prices were ever to stall   It all began in 2001 911 … the dot.com bubble The Fed had to act because of the fact A recession would mean big trouble So the Fed Funds Rate, sitting just below eight Was cut to under two And you had to know with rates so low That a refi boom would ensue   The volume of mortgages written back then Stunned imaginations In a single quarter in 2003 A trillion in originations! But something happened late that year That caused long rates to rise And that was the end of the refi boom It came as quite a surprise   With refi’s gone so were big fees But banks still had money to lend And the search for buyers to fill the gap Seemingly had no end The Fed kept pumping through 2005 To keep short rates very low With no sight of inflation across the nation The target was simply to grow   Of course the key for all to see Was a robust housing market Buyers could borrow lots of cash And a house was a good place to park it A summer home … a new big house No one seemed to care Homes were made of bricks and land The value would always be there   It didn’t matter what rate you paid Or what you made in a year For a while liquidity led to stupidity “Just sign and see the cashier” High LTV’s and Option ARMs Negative Am’s and more 2-28’s with teaser rates And ridiculous Fico scores   Competition was the force That made the music play As long as prices didn’t fall Everything was OK People could always sell their homes For more than they had paid That kept foreclosures and defaults low And lots of money was made   Fannie and Fred were always ahead Then Countrywide got in the fray Then Lehman and Merrill and Goldman Sachs Couldn’t be kept away You can guess that MBS Helped make the trading brisk Investors, thought that the paper they bought Was traunched with well measured risk   To that add leverage and default swaps And then house prices fell The intercept shift was very swift And that was the closing bell The very first city to see the drop Was Boston in 2006 Then one by one they began to slip Leaving us in a fix   We tried the tax credit which seemed to work For a few months the markets came back But when it expired the markets got mired Resuming their downward track The inventory of unsold homes Still continued to grow And we’re hardly building any new homes With starts at a 50-year low   A number of problems remained as risks As we wait for markets to turn: The number of loans that still need to be marked Is making stomachs churn Twelve million who want to work Don’t have jobs today And slow is the pipeline of loans in default Since no one wants to pay   In the longer run a lot depends On the rate of household formation That depends in part of course On the rate of immigration It also matters what kids do Like living with Mom and Dad Or doubling up till they get a job To pay for their very own pad   For a while there was talk of a double dip The recovery was in a stall Consumers were down and beginning to frown Jobs hadn’t come back at all The Euro was falling, the banks were appalling As we wallowed in bad sovereign debt Europeans were asking aloud Really … how bad can it get?   The guys at the Fed have repeatedly said That their mandate includes employment But with rates at zero no one’s a hero No weapons are left for deployment QE1 was lots of fun Then along came QE2 We did the “twist” and we took on more risk Not knowing just what they would do   So now we come to the end of this ode Without much to say for certain I hate to say, that’s where we are Not beginning nor final curtain The truth of the matter at the end of the day Is that markets will make you humble Just when you think that it’s time for a drink They will turn and fortunes will crumble   That free markets work to provide what we want Is a notion that’s not in dispute The problem is that once in a while Markets overshoot And when they do in a market so large A lot of people feel pain In the blink of an eye many gave back What it took 10 years to gain   Among those who are getting the blame A few deserve to be flayed But a forecast can only be judged against What we knew at the time it was made Sometimes the future is like the past And sometimes it is not But when it comes to what we know The past is all we’ve got   Of course there is greed and there is a need For moral hazard and rules And for figuring out the effectiveness Of the new financial tools Politicians, of course, are starting to shout That they want more retribution It’s better, I think, if they used their time Helping to find a solution.   FREE AppDownload
