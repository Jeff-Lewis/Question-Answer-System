The Bank of England is keeping interest rates and its asset purchase plan unchanged as expected. But in an unusual move, the BoE issued a statement, which it typically does only when it makes a change in policy. Some are attributing this to new BoE governor Mark Carney, who appears to be pushing for more transparency. "The latest remit letter to the MPC from the Chancellor had requested that the Committee provide an assessment, alongside its August Inflation Report, of the case for adopting some form of forward guidance, including the possible use of intermediate thresholds," noted the statement. Forward guidance is one of the tools employed by the U.S. Federal Reserve in its effort to be more transparent. Here's the full statement: The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today voted to maintain the official Bank Rate paid on commercial bank reserves at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion.
