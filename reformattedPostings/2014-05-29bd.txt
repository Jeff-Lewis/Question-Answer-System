REUTERS/Jonanthan ErnstCall for nominations! Business Insider recently published its inaugural list of The Most Powerful Person At Every Age. Taking into consideration a person's sphere of influence, future power, and estimated net worth, we determined the movers and shakers of the world, ages 0 to 100. Now we're zeroing in on Wall Street. We'll leave the toddlers and tweens off this list, but we will include smart, innovative folks who are having an impact in the finance industry from the young to the old. For our Most Powerful People In Finance At (Almost) Every Age list, we will evaluate candidates based on the following criteria. Anyone come to mind? Send an email including the nominee's name, contact information, age, a brief description of what makes them powerful, and any relevant links to our Lists &amp; Rankings team: Melia Robinson (mrobinson@businessinsider.com) and Melissa Stanger (mstanger@businessinsider.com). We'll be accepting nominations through Friday, May 30. Thanks! FREE AppDownload
