Google EarthThe housing recovery has been slowing and home price growth is starting to cool. In fact Case-Shiller home prices fell 0.3% month-over-month in June.  But there are pockets of the country where housing is rapidly heating up. The real estate brokerage Redfin says that the up-and-coming areas are "mostly adjacent to highly sought-after neighborhoods that have become difficult to get into because of high prices and few homes for sale." Redfin used its own proprietary website data to figure out which neighborhoods are about to get hot. By looking at the neighborhoods at which more and more people are looking on the website, they're able to make a guess about what housing markets are about to get hot. To rank the top 10, Redfin looked at year-over-year increase in the average numbers of page views and favorites per home, as well as the changes in rank. FREE AppDownload
