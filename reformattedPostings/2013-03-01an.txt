The Daily Pennsylvanian reported this week that Nadirah Farah Foley, a former admissions officer, had left the school after making fun of applicants on her Facebook account (h/t IvyGate). Chalk this up as yet another reason not to be too open on Facebook — as if there weren't enough. Foley, a Princeton alum, was responsible for coordinating admissions in Connecticut. Her Facebook posts were discovered when an anonymous source sent screenshots of her updates to Penn's Dean of Admissions and The Daily Pennsylvanian. Here's some of what Foley was making fun of (from the Daily Pennsylvanian): In one essay, a student had written about his “long and deep” connections to the University, citing the fact that he had been circumcised at Penn Hillel years ago. “I look forward to engaging in the academic, social and Orthodox Jewish communities on campus,” the student wrote, according to Foley’s post. “Stop the madness,” Foley said in response to the essay on Facebook. In another excerpt, she quoted an essay in which an applicant had described the experience of overcoming his fear of using the bathroom outdoors while camping in the wilderness. “Another gem,” Foley wrote of the student’s topic choice.
