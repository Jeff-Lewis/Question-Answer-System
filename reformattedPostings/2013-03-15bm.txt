But those thinking longer-term are probably more concerned about which stocks they should be in. Morgan Stanley just published a massive 32-page report for its "20 For 2016," a list of 20 stock picks. "The main criterion is sustainability — of competitive advantages, business model, pricing power, cost efficiency, and growth," the analysts wrote. "We are taking a long term view," they continued. "There was no prerequisite in our analysis that they be rated Overweight, nor specific assumptions about where we are in the economic cycle or any other valuation considerations. Our driving principle was to create a list of companies whose business models and market positions would be increasingly differentiated by 2016." We pulled the 20 stocks and highlighted the 5 year revenue and earnings growth rates. We also included one of the many reasons why the analysts picked each stock. FREE AppDownload
