REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz Allergan Inc. shareholder Paulson &amp; Co. is urging the Botox maker to merge with the specialty pharmaceutical company Shire Plc as a potential alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals, according to two people familiar with the matter. The hedge fund, which is Allergan’s third-largest shareholder, told Allergan CEO David Pyott that it would support a deal with Shire, the sources said. The deal would not be structured as a so-called tax inversion, the people said. It was not immediately clear whether Allergan would pursue such a deal. Back in June, Paulson had a totally different view on whom Allergan should merge with. At CNBC's Delivering Alpha Conference, Paulson said Allergan should sell itself to Valeant, a deal that is also supported (financially) by Paulson's fellow hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. So far, Allergan has resisted Valeant's advances and indicated that it is looking for another buyer. Allergan argues that Valeant has no organic growth and uses its acquisitions to hide that fact. Short-seller Jim Chanos has made the same argument, calling Valeant an accounting rollup. Paulson’s new plan for Shire comes as fellow pharmaceutical company AbbVie’s $54 billion deal to buy Shire is close to unraveling after the US government changed the rules governing tax inversions. Paulson suffered over $780 million in paper losses after that news broke last week.  Allergan and Paulson declined to comment. Valeant reported earnings Monday morning, and much of the following conference call was spent discussing whether Ackman — who was in the company's offices the night before — and the company would up their bid for Allergan. Earlier this month it was raised to $191 a share from its original April bid of $177 a share. Ackman and Valeant CEO Michael Pearson have said that they will not overpay for the stock.
