Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota is speaking in Minnesota right now. The dovish Fed official is reiterating his endorsement of a lower unemployment rate threshold to guide monetary policy.

"A recent working paper by senior Board of Governors staff suggests that this policy stance could indeed have material benefits in terms of the evolution of prices and employment." If this idea gains traction, we could see loose monetary policy for longer. FREE AppDownload
