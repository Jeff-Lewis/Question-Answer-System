TMZApple could release a new version of its Lightning iPhone and iPad cable with the iPhone 6 that can be plugged into a USB port either way up. The cable would remove the need to fiddle around to find the right way up to plug the iPhone’s USB cable into a computer. The USB Promotor Group, which governs USB standards, recently announced the completed design for a new “type C” reversible USB plug that could be inserted either way up but would not be compatible with current USB ports. A patent filed in 2013 by Apple, however, describes “reversible or dual orientation USB plug connectors” that can be plugged into any standard computer USB port to “reduce the potential USB connector damage and user frustration.” The connector design would be compatible with any current and future full-size USB ports on computers and other devices. Recent unconfirmed leaked pictures appeared online supposedly showing an iPhone 6 USB Lightning cable with the reversible connector design.

While a new cable is not certain, Apple’s switch to the Lightning cable from the 30-pin dock connector used on the iPhone and iPad since its inception until two years ago made the end that plugs into the iPhone reversible.
