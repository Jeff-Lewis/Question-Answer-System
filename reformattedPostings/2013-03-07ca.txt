Economists had only expected it to widen to $42.6 billion from $38.5 billion last month. Much of this surprise is being attibuted to a 12.3 percent jump in oil imports. The petroleum deficit which widened to $24.3 billion from $18.6 billion. Here's Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics: Exports fell by 1.2% m/m in January, partly reversing a 2.1% m/m surge the month before. Both the original spike and subsequent drop back were driven by a temporary jump in industrial supplies, which was largely due to volatility in fuel oil exports. Imports increased by 1.8% m/m, with all of the gain due to an increase in the value of petroleum-related imports. However, the latter was largely due to a bounce back in the volume of petroleum-related imports rather than a rise in prices. Ashworth adds that he expects this to be "neutral or slightly negative" to Q1 GDP growth. FREE AppDownload
