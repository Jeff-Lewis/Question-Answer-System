The Fine Young Gentleman Men have two goals when they pack— The first goal is to economize space while still having enough clothing to keep up appearances.  The second is to pack in a way that is best for your clothing; essentially, in a manner that will limit the possibility of creasing, wrinkling, stress and stains. Before we get into how to pack your wardrobe, let’s first go over a few facts that will help you keep your expectations reasonable when packing and unpacking. First, packing is not a perfect art, it is impossible to pack, travel and unpack and not have any creases or wrinkles in any of your clothing. One of the most important things to do is the make sure things stay in place. When they are able to shift around a likelihood of creases (and thus ironing) increases. Second, not all textiles are created equal. Certain fabrics will crease more easily than others. For instance, linen will crease just by looking at it, whereas wool is a bit hardier. Also as part of this, it is important to realize that heavier weight fabrics crease less easily than lighter weight ones. For instance, a heavy wool flannel suit will rarely crease whereas a tropical wool suit will crease relatively easily. Third, garment bags are a waste of money. You can pack your suit, shoes and shirts in your normal suitcase and they will emerge in a similar, if not a better state. FREE AppDownload
