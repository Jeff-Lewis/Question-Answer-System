REUTERS/ Toru HanaiU.S. automakers closed out 2013 with weak sales figures, reporting a seasonally-adjusted sales rate of 15.6 million units in December when analysts called for 16.0 million. Chrysler and Ford were in the green, but both missed analyst expectations. GM tanked 6.3% when analysts were looking for a 1.5% gain. "An expected post-Christmas surge in [light vehicle] sales fell somewhat short of industry expectations," according to Wards Auto.

Still, some cars were hotter than others. We picked out the 21 best-selling cars in December. FREE AppDownload
