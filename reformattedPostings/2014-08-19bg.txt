Economist Intelligence UnitProbably don't want to live in these places. Also The Economist has acknowledged there is an error in the Tunis entry. Living standards in Russia's two biggest cities are slipping. According to an Economist Intelligence Unit survey, Moscow and St. Petersburg have both seen their "liveability" rankings decline more than 3% in the past five years. The survey ranked global cities based on stability, healthcare, culture &amp; environment, education, and infrastructure. The survey does not specify where the pair saw the greatest declines but did note that "events in Ukraine" were having "knock-on" effects.  There is other anecdotal evidence of the decline. According to Global Property Guide, Moscow's resale apartment prices fell by 8% in Q1 on an inflation-adjusted basis. In St. Petersburg they fell by 4.6%. There was actually a surge in purchasing activity in the first half of 2014, but that was only because the ruble had weakened, according to GPG. The ruble has fallen 9% against the dollar in the past 12 months. Cities on the rest of the list, above, have all been experiencing serious problems with unemployment, violence, civil unrest, and instability all around. FREE AppDownload
