NanexNatural gas volume disappearing in January ahead of supply announcement.Thomson Reuters has been giving elite traders a 2 second advantage on the bi-monthly Consumer Confidence index, a key number for traders. In the past few days, that revelation has angered a lot of people on Wall Street. A two second advantage may not seem like a lot of time to a human, but to a robot, with the right (read: fastest) connection to a stock exchange, it's plenty of time to spray out thousands of orders and (most likely) cancel them. That impacts price. Suddenly, the market thinks that a given ETF, equity — whatever you're trading — is really in demand. But it's not. When it happens incredibly fast (like, in a second) it can be like a tsunami that rises and then disappears. Until the correct price is found, what all of that does is simply create a mess — a sort of high speed chaos that can only be seen clearly in milliseconds but can send ripples throughout the market as the tsunami dies down.
