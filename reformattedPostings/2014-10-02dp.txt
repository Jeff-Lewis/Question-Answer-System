DisneyMario Draghi wrestles with deflation. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi compared himself and other European policymakers to Hercules yesterday. This wasn't some passing reference to the (genuinely) "Herculean" task he faces trying to kickstart the European economy and stave off deflation. This was a detailed description of the whole Hercules v. the hydra myth (including the part most people forget, where Hercules' nephew deals with the hydra's severed heads).

In other words, he simultaneously tackled the problem on the surface and at the root,” Mr. Draghi said. “And this is exactly what we need to do today in the euro area,” he said. Obviously, he's given this some thought. FREE AppDownload
