On Wednesday, Yahoo launched a new blogging platform for Wall Streeters. There's only one condition — you have to be at the top of the game. "We’re opening up Yahoo Finance in a scalable way and socializing expert-generated financial content through the awesome powers of Tumblr, bringing on board some of the very smartest minds on the street,” Yahoo Interactive Editor Phil Pearlman said. So think hedge fund managers like Carl Icahn, Chairman of Icahn Enterprises; Jon and Pete Najarian of optionMONSTER; buy-side research site, Estimize; Barry Ritholtz, CIO of Ritholtz Wealth Management; Dragonfly Capital Management President Greg Harmon; Dan Nathan, CNBC contributor and editor of Risk Reversal; and more. The platform is simple, easy to navigate and powered by Tumblr. Here's the page of Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown. It's called The Kindergarten. Yahoo Finance screenshot Every contributor has a Tumblr page that they can update at their leisure. That content is then pulled onto the Yahoo finance page and any platform on which you consume it. Of course, you can also follow specific bloggers on your own Tumblr dashboard. You can check out the full list of contributors here. Yahoo plans to grow it — and you can e-mail a submission to Pearlman at pearlman@yahoo-inc.com — but they only want you if you're an "accomplished and seasoned financial pro." So you better be good.
