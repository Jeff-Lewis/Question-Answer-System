APInitial jobless claims rose slightly to 290,000 last week. Expectations were for the report to show claims rise slightly, to 280,000 from 278,000 a week ago.  Last week's number wasn't revised. The four-week moving average of claims also rose, to 285,000 from 279,000 last week. Last week's report also showed the four-week moving average of initial claims fell to 279,000, its lowest level since April 2000.  Despite the increases in both initial claims and four-week moving average of claims, jobless claims still remain at multi-year lows. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro wrote that, "we see no reason to expect the trend in claims to start moving higher anytime soon; absent a shove from tighter policy, claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period."
