Screenshot, CNBCCNBC executives are furious at SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci for relaunching iconic business program "Wall Street Week." That's why the popular contributor hasn't been on air since June 3. The trouble started last month at SALT Las Vegas — SkyBridge's massive hedge-fund conference. That's when Scaramucci announced on CNBC that the firm would be restarting the show with the help of former CNBC executive Susan Krakower. Krakower developed shows like "Fast Money" and "Mad Money With Jim Cramer." Part of the issue is that CNBC executives were blindsided when they learned of the deal at SALT. Sources close to the situation told Business Insider that Scaramucci didn't tell CNBC because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with Maryland Public Broadcasting, his partner in the "Wall Street Week" relaunch deal. But that excuse didn't mollify anyone at CNBC. Executives feared the weekly show would be a competitor to their programming and were still livid at Scaramucci, who has an exclusive contributor contract with the network. The network has three years left on its exclusive four-year deal to cover SALT, which draws some of the biggest names in finance. All that said, sources say that it looks like the Mooch (as he is lovingly called) will work everything out with CNBC. It was pretty ugly for a minute there, though. FREE AppDownload
