Yet, the S&amp;P 500 has returned nearly 230% cumulatively since the bear market low on March 9, 2009. How did that happen and is it justified? Before trying to answer to those questions, it is worth pointing out that this situation is not all that unusual. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 median return is 13% (average is 12%) when real gross domestic product (GDP) grows less than 3%, with the S&amp;P generating a positive return 68% of the time. However, a good portion of those returns come during recessions<U+2009>—<U+2009>historically, the best time to buy stocks is at recession troughs. But even if we take those periods in and around recessions out of the equation and look at annual returns when GDP growth is between 1–3%, the median (and average) S&amp;P 500 return is a respectable 7–8%. Stocks tend to like average (or slightly below average) growth, which is not strong enough to generate worrisome inflation. Now back to the question of what has driven this stock market to far outperform economic growth. Some might say quantitative easing (QE), which ended at the end of October 2014 in the United States (the Bank of Japan expanded its QE program last week on Halloween). While QE has benefitted U.S. stocks (how much is up for debate) by helping keep interest rates low and encouraging investors to buy riskier assets (see this week’s Weekly Economic Commentary for details), the bull market has been driven by much more than that. Increasing confidence in the economic recovery<U+2009>—<U+2009>albeit a slow one<U+2009>—<U+2009>and greater policy clarity in Washington      have also been factors. But we think the best answer is earnings. In fact, over the past four decades, earnings have provided solid support for equity   market gains [Figure 1].  LPL FinancialstocksBut this commentary is not a deep dive into earnings (that’s coming soon). Instead, this week we highlight the differences between the S&amp;P 500 and GDP, i.e., the U.S. economy, to shed some light on how corporate profits can grow so much faster than the economy, and bring stock prices right along with them. LPL Financial  How Is S&amp;P Different from GDP? S&amp;P 500 companies have different drivers for earnings than the components that drive GDP. There are several key factors that differentiate the economic data from the earning power of corporate America that we think are important for investors to keep in mind: Solid Business Spending with Slower GDP Growth Trajectory We believe the backdrop of solid business spending within a slower trajectory of overall GDP growth can be a favorable one for the stock market. The economic data, while good recently, do not accurately reflect the earning power of corporate America, which remains quite strong. The S&amp;P is not GDP<U+2009>—<U+2009>S&amp;P 500 companies have different drivers for earnings than the components that drive GDP growth. Stocks are fundamentally driven by earnings, which have supported the gains during the current bull market and left valuations still within a reasonable range. The earnings picture still looks quite good today, with the S&amp;P 500 on track for 9% year-over-year earnings growth in the third quarter, with about three quarters of the index constituents having reported. Although stocks are at the low end of our target 10–15% S&amp;P 500 return range for 2014, we see further gains between now and year end may be likely, with profit growth as a primary driver—with perhaps some help from  the calendar, as midterm elections have historically been positive for  stock returns.
