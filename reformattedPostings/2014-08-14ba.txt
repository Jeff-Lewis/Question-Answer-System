On Thursday, shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hit $200,000 for the first time. This number has doubled since October 2006. Back when Buffett became a majority shareholder in 1964, the stock was only $19. Imagine if you had invested in Buffett back then. We wanted to see what would've happened to a $1,000 investment if we had bet on Berkshire Hathaway in a given year — from 1964 all the way through 2013. The numbers aren't too crazy for recent years. For example, for the year 2004, your $1,000 would have turned into $2,342 by the end of 2013.  But if you had invested in 1964, your $1,000 would be $10.5 million. Buffett is known for his long-term investment strategy. And people who invested in Berkshire Hathaway early on have certainly reaped the benefits of that.

So we also created a log-scale version as well.Business Insider/Elena Holodny And in case you wanted to see the numbers, here's a table of all the data. The left column shows the year (we started from 2013 and worked backward). And the right column shows what your $1,000 would be worth today, given the year you invested it.
