Melia Robinson/BIThe pace of existing home sales fell 1.8% to an annualized rate of 5.05 million. Economists estimated sales would climb to a 5.20 million pace. "There was a marked decline in all-cash sales from investors,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.. "On the positive side, first-time buyers have a better chance of purchasing a home now that bidding wars are receding and supply constraints have significantly eased in many parts of the country.” "We think home sales are running out of steam now that the post-winter rebound is over and the buyers for distressed  properties fade away," Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson said. "The implied level of distressed sales has halved since last summer, but tight mortage lending standards mean that regular non-distressed buyers cannot fill the gap in the near-term." The median existing-home price was $219,800, up 4.8% from a year ago. "This marks the 30th consecutive month of year-over-year price gains," the NAR noted. Inventory fell 1.7% to 2.31 million units, which represents a 5.5 month supply. This is potentially worrisome as the decline occured before the September rally in mortgage rates. "Let’s not overemphasize the realtor’s report saying investors are leaving the market," Bank of Toky0-Mitsubishi's Chris Rupkey said. "There is no fundamental economic weakness story in the decline today. This is not another indicator of slack economic conditions out there. Besides maybe investors are leaving the market because home prices are too high, no more bargains to be had." FREE AppDownload
