This morning JP Morgan reported its first quarterly net loss ever under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon — a net loss of 17 cent per share. Yes, you'll remember that this even includes the carnage of the financial crisis. The losses were caused by mounting legal costs the bank incurred from a regulatory crack down on a wide range of its operations, from energy trading violations to fines paid for legacy mortgage backed securities the bank inherited when it purchased Bear Stearns. The worst part of that is that, based on JPM's earnings call, the bank clearly believes this isn't over. Back in 2010 JPM kept legal reserves at $3 billion, now it's up to a whopping $23 billion (as you can see below in the table from the bank's earnings presentation). On the call, CFO Marianne Lake said the bank was in a "highly charged and very volatile" legal environment, "far beyond what we reasonably expected... even a few weeks ago." The bank expected a Q3 legal loss of $5.7 billion and incurred losses of $8 billion. Quarter over quarter, Lake said, the deployment of these funds to settle the bank's legal issues will be "lumpy." So shareholders can expect a "lumpy" ride.             					                                                                                                                                            facebook                                                                        linkedin                                                                        twitter                                                                        google+                                                                        email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                email                                                                                        share                                                                         share                                                                         tweet                                                                         share                                                                         email                                                                                        Share on Facebook                                                                         Share on Twitter                                                                         Share on Linkedin                                                                         Share on Google Plus                                                                         email                                                            Recommended For You                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];                                    _taboola.push({mode:'thumbs-1r', container:'taboola-below-main-column', placement:'below-main-column'});                                                                                                                        Comments             Comments on this post are now closed.
