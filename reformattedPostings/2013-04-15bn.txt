Venture capitalist John Doerr has been taking a good deal of ribbing for admitting that he likes to wear Google Glass while playing the game Scattergories with his family. The New York Times' Claire Cain Miller wondered if that was allowed. "It is questionable whether that follows the game's rules," she wrote.  Computer security legend, Bruce Schneier, decided it isn't allowed. "Questionable? Questionable?" He wrote today on his blog. "It just like using a computer's dictionary while playing Scrabble, or a computer odds program while playing poker, or a computer chess program while playing an in-person game. There's no question at all -- it's cheating." Schneier then pointed out, "We're seeing the birth of a new epithet, 'glasshole.'" Urban Dictionary, keeper of all things meme, already has a definition for it. "Glasshole" means "a person who constantly talks to their Google Glass, ignoring the outside world." FREE AppDownload
