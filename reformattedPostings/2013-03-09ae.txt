AmazonEarlier this week, we published Stifel Nicolaus Managing Director Dave Lutz' annual list of books recommended by traders. Every year, Lutz polls his clientele and ask them what books they like. He then sends out a big list to give everyone fresh ideas.

Others have maybe always been on your list. If so, here's a great excuse to finally get around to them. FREE AppDownload
