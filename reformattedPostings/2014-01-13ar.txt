Whiskey tipplers woke up to the huge news that Suntory — the Japanese whiskey of Lost in Translation fame — will buy American whiskey giant Beam Inc. Beam puts out two of the more famous American liquors, Jim Beam and Maker's Mark.  "Suntory is in Asia and, I think, believes it has some competency advantages in terms of Asian marketing and distribution," writes Slate's Matt Yglesias.

Surely some of that exporting will go to India. Take a look at this chart of global whiskey consumption from Goldman Sachs.
