Steve Kovach/Business InsiderGoogle’s launch of brand new Android software for wearables, first seen running on a few smartwatches, finally means that wearable technology has a solid lowest common denominator. Until now, no two wearable devices ran the same software, which meant apps and services for one smartwatch wouldn’t run on another. Android Wear has essentially made other smartwatch operating systems, like Sony’s custom software based on Android for its Smartwatch 2, redundant. Others like Samsung’s Tizen, which powers the Korean manufacturer’s Gear smartwatches, no longer seem quite so attractive for developers. Google has gotten a lot right in this, the first release of Android Wear, but not everything about the way it works and what it does is fantastic. After a solid week using it, here are some mixed reactions. Android Wear doesn’t do a lot beyond notifications, including information from Google Now. That makes it only really applicable for the kinds of people, like myself, who are constantly dealing with notifications, who pick up their phone immediately when something goes off. For others that are less glued to their phones, emails, tweets and text messages, the smartwatch experience doesn’t really provide enough to justify buying a £160 accessory. But third-party apps like Evernote, IFTTT and Google Maps are already beginning to exploit Android Wear’s potential. Google’s first stab at Android Wear is user-friendly and relatively polished, making a great platform to build upon. Developers and Google alike will have to be careful not to over-complicate the experience while doing so, however. • Google smartwatches reviewed: LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live • Pebble review: simple, efficient and a good watch This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk  FREE AppDownload
