flickr/mattbuck007People leave high paying banking and consulting jobs to get MBAs because top programs provide a big salary bump.  John Byrne at Poets &amp; Quants took the salary data business schools give to US News and World Report for their MBA rankings and revealed the top 10 programs in the US by average starting salary in a post at LinkedIn. According to Byrne, US News figures are the most accurate for average salary because most schools report salary and bonus numbers separately, failing to account for the fact that some MBAs don't get a signing bonus. US News includes grads who didn't get a bonus to get a better average.  Salaries line up pretty nicely with quality, our business school rankings have Stanford and Harvard in the top two spots, though with the two reversed.  Here's Byrne's chart:  John Byrne/LinkedIn There's a complete list of all 39 schools that average a six-figure starting salary over at Poets &amp; Quants.
