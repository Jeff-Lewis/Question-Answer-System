For those that think we could be range-bound between 1800 and 1900 in the SPX until there is some sort of catalyst to break us out in either direction (as I do), it may make sense to take a slightly more tactical approach to your trading/investing. What does tactical mean? Well, in a fairly well defined range that we are in at the moment, identify your core positions, be nimble on those with less conviction, look to add yield with overwrites, add protection when stocks look extended or vulnerable, and leverage at the low end of the range when sentiment seems to get a bit dire and stocks oversold. With that overall strategy, the next decision is name selection. We broadly think that the growth leaders that have been beaten to a pulp will take many weeks or months to heal from here, so they’re certainly in the camp where rallies are likely a sale. On the other hand, there are some value stocks that have been neglected over the past couple years that could look interesting for bounce plays if the right setup presents itself. With the whippy price action, and cheap implied volatility, we generally like spread structures that minimize decay to take advantage of directional moves back and forth. 2014 has ushered in a choppier era compared to the slow, grinding markets of 2012 and 2013.
