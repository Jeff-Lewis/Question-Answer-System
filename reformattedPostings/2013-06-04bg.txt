Instagram/danderozIt's that time of the year.  Wall Street summer internships have begun.   Congratulations on scoring the position.  Now it's time make sure you impress your peers and superiors with an appropriate internship wardrobe.  Don't worry. We're here to help! Our thanks go out to The Fine Young Gentleman, one of our very favorite men's fashion bloggers, whom we consulted for tips and suggestions. "As an intern the whole idea is to not rock the boat. With many of the internships the whole idea is to kick ass, take names, get a job and not rock the boat. Key phrase being ‘not rock the boat,’" says the Fine Young Gentleman, "It is not that you want to blend in with all of the others, it is just that you don’t want to stick out like a three legged dog." "I think it is pretty simple, err on the conservative side of things and realize there may be more do’s than don’ts at your company. You need to look and act professional and you need to act in a manner consistent with the firm which you are interning at."  FREE AppDownload
