REUTERS/Brendan McDermidIn addition to today's Non-Farm Payrolls report, two other economic datapoints are coming out today. From Calculated Risk: • At 8:30 AM, the Trade Balance report for January from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for the U.S. trade deficit to increase to $39.0 billion in January from $38.7 billion in December. • At 3:00 PM, Consumer Credit for January from the Federal Reserve. The consensus is for credit to increase $14.5 billion in January.  Neither one will likely be particularly market moving, but both are interesting and fun to comb through for nuggets.
