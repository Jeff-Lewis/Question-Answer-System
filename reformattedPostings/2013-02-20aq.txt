Tesla CEO Elon Musk is ready to stop arguing with the New York Times over the newspaper's controversial review of the electric Model S, he tweeted this afternoon: Enough sour grapes from @nytjamescobb (auto ed) and a few others to start a winery. Can we just bury hatchet &amp; move on? The tweet was addressed to James G. Cobb, the Automobiles Editor at the NYT. In a four-part response, Cobb was cordial, but indicated he is still annoyed by Musk's aggressive criticism of the John Broder's review. Musk called the article "fake" soon after it was published. Here's Cobb's guarded reply: @elonmusk Three-parter: Elon, I admire your vision &amp; respect what you have built. You promised a game-changer &amp; Model S appears to be one. @elonmusk 2 of 3: NYT had had many positive pieces about @teslamotors, as you know, and until this month had a good working relationship… @elonmusk 3 of 3: …but calling @jbrodernyt’s account “fake” was over the line &amp; impugned reputation of a good man and a consummate pro. @elonmusk Nobody here wants @teslamotors to fail. Quite the opposite, as we've demonstrated: ow.ly/hTwoh That may have prompted Musk's peace offering: Appreciate thoughtful @sulliview article. Faith in @nytimes restored. Tesla wants people to think about the game-changing, planet-saving nature of the Model S, not the likelihood of the car rolling to a stop in the middle of a winter roadtrip. FREE AppDownload
