More than 60 protests will be held in the Washington area alone in the "biggest Black Friday strike till date", pressure group OUR Walmart said on a media call. The group also plans strikes at the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, Chicago, Seattle, Texas, Minneapolis and Tampa among other places. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, owner of Wal-Mart brand stores, and the largest private employer in the United States, has been a target for activists in the contentious national debate over proposals to raise the minimum wage.
