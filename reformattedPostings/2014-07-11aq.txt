APIf you've been desperately trying to find a good Scud missile to add to your military arsenal, there's a Silicon Valley auction that's right up your alley. Up for sale on Friday and Saturday in Portola Valley, California, is the Littlefield Collection, a vast array of tanks, vehicles, and military weaponry amassed from World War I to present by the late Jacques Littlefield, a former HP engineer. "The Littlefield Collection boasts an impressive range of vehicles and represents points in history that appeal to a global audience beyond traditional military collectors," said Ian Kelleher, a specialist with Auctions America, in a statement. "The majority of the collection remains drivable and usable and can be easily repurposed for private use." Littlefield founded California's Military Vehicle Technology Foundation, which housed many of the artifacts and vehicles comprising his collection. We picked our favorites among the 114 vehicles, parts, and accessories that are up for grabs.
