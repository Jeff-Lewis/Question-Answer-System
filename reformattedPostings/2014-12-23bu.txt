AP Images/ Mary AltafferArt Cashin and the NYSE traders.Legendary New York Stock Exchange floor trader and director of floor operations for UBS Art Cashin has sent out his annual Wall Street Christmas poem. This year he wove in some of the financial and political highlight of 2014: Wall Street waiting for the Fed rate hikes, Putin's annexation of Crimea, and the oil plunge... But he also threw in a few pop culture references, too — the Ellen selfie at the Oscars and (of course) Kim Kardashian. In any case, it's certainly worth the read this Christmas Eve Eve. So check it out below. 'Tis two days before Christmas and at each brokerage house The only thing stirring was the click of a mouse Down on the Exchange the tape inches along Brokers bargained and traded as they hummed an old song   The Fed says they're "patient" but some folks still fear That rates they'll start hiking too early next year   Frisco took the series and Seattle the Bowl But Tiger still struggles to get the ball in the hole   Ellen D. took a group selfie at the Oscar awards The darn thing got retweeted till it pulled down some boards   Putin scooped up Crimea and some parts of Ukraine But an oil plunge and sanctions are causing him pain   In Europe a song contest was won by a nun And the song that she sang was - Girls just want to have fun   In Portland a kid offered a hug to anyone near A cop took advantage for the pic of the year   But with Cosby and Kim K. there was little to cheer Yet it's Christmastime, Alice And Santa is near   So stop looking backwards have a cup of good cheer And kiss you a loved one raise your hopes for next year   And amidst all the trading Christmas themes we will heed And share our good fortune with families in need   And tomorrow they’ll pause as we wait on the bell To sing a tradition a song for old “Nell”   Don’t let this year’s problems impede Christmas Cheer Resolve to be happy throughout the New Year   And resist ye Grinch feelings let joy never stop Put the bad at the bottom keep the good on the top   So count up your blessings along with your worth You’re still living here in the best place on earth   And think ye of wonders that light children's eyes And hope Santa will bring you that Christmas surprise   So play ye a carol by Mario Lanza Unless you are waiting to celebrate Kwanzaa   Hanukkah’s ending And Ramadan’s long gone Different folks, different holidays yet each spirit lives on   Whatever your feast is we hope you all still Find yourself just surrounded by folks of goodwill   Wednesday, as the bell rings hark to your heart’s call And as Santa would shout Merry Christmas to All!
