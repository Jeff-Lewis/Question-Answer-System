The Federal Reserve has incredible power, and the decisions it makes have profound implications for the global economy. All eyes are on the Fed as it plans to taper its stimulative quantitative easing program, which consists of the monthly purchases $85 billion worth of bonds. With the Fed getting increasing prominence in the news, more and more people have become self-proclaimed experts on the institution.  And this has led to plenty of confusion about where the Fed stands and what it can do from here. "Does the Fed change its reaction function every month?" asked Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Ethan Harris. "Market sentiment around the Fed has swung dramatically in the past six months—in the spring it was “QE infinity,” by the fall it was “tapering regardless of the data” and more recently some seem to again see QE infinity. This swinging pendulum in part reflects an endless array of exaggerated stories about the Fed exit." In a research not to clients on Thursday, Harris laid out five exaggerated stories and pointed out their problems.: "The Fed call has been and will be about the economy," said Harris. If GDP growth picks up, the Fed will taper. And if inflation stays low, the taper will happen slowly. FREE AppDownload
