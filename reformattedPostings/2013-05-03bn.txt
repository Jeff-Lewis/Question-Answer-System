The 165,000 new jobs was above the 140,000 that was expected. The unemployment rate fell to 7.5%. It was expected to stay flat at 7.6%. And there were big upward revisions to last month, which was originally really weak. Here's what the announcement says about revisions, which were strong for both March and February. The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for February was revised from +268,000 to +332,000, and the change for March was revised from +88,000 to +138,000. With these revisions, employment gains in February and March combined were 114,000 higher than previously reported. This is just one report, but it's a huge relief, given the apparent weakening in data lately. In terms of breakdown by industry, there was a nice 29,000 increase in retail sales, which is great, given that this was weak in March. And here's another number indicating that the consumer is doing good: "Within leisure and hospitality, employment in food services and drinking places rose by 38,000 over the month." The public sector shed another 11,000 jobs. The full report is here. FREE AppDownload
