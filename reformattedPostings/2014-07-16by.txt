DealBook Conference Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, who runs Chicago-based Citadel, says that a Century Fox and Time Warner deal "makes a lot of sense." Earlier today, it was reported that Century Fox offered to buy Time Warner in a deal valued at $80 billion.  Time Warner has rejected that offer. Griffin told the audience at the CNBC Delivering Alpha Conference that both media companies have "great assets" and that it would be a good deal for both of them.  Citadel's portfolio includes both Time Warner and Century Fox.  "I think we'll get to 'yes,'" he said.  FREE AppDownload
