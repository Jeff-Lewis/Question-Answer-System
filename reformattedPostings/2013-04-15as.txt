REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiThere are multiple unconfirmed reports that a person of interest is under guard in relation to Monday's tragic Boston Marathon explosions.  There's a lot of confusion: Police commissioner Edward Davis told reporters at 18:00 EDT that authorities were NOT guarding a suspect in Mass. General. SWAT teams, police and federal agents have completely surrounded Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston, where other injured victims are being treated, according to Boston's 7News WHDH. Reporters speaking to a hospital spokesperson made it clear they believed the heavy police presence indicated they believed a suspect was being treated at the hospital. But Davis said, "there is a heavy police presence at all the hospitals ... you shouldn't read anything into to that." He said officers were there to get witness statements from victims, as well. Previously, Fox News, NBC and The New York Post all report that police have detained a possible suspect, though there has been no official confirmation from Boston Police.   "Officials say that Boston PD are 'guarding' a wounded man at a Boston hospital as a 'possible suspect,'" NBC News tweeted on behalf of Jim Miklaszewski. A police spokesperson has said there have been no official arrests or apprehensions at the time.  FREE AppDownload
