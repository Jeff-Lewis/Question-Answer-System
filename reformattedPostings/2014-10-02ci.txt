AP ImagesBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, the Omaha businessman said: “I made a mistake on Tesco. That was a huge mistake by me.” Buffett is Tesco's fourth-biggest shareholder since he started buying the supermarket's shares in 2007. In 2013, he owned 301 million shares, about 3.7% of the company, the FT reported. According CNBC, Buffett has lost more than $700 million on his investment.  Tesco is struggling to compete with other discounts retailers like Aldi and Lidl, and its shares are at an 11-year low. The share price dropped by 49% this year and received a further blow last month when the retailer announced it had overstated its profits by 250 million pounds.  FREE AppDownload
