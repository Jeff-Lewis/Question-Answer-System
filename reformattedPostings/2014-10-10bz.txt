REUTERS/Blair GableBank of England Governor Mark Carney The Bank of England released on Friday a record of private discussions with Scottish firms and emergency plans, drawn up to protect Britain's banking system in case Scotland had voted Yes in last month's independence referendum. We've pulled out the most important points: In short, the Bank was concerned about the effect of independence on financial stability across the United Kingdom. At the same time, it expected most of the problems to fall on the newly-independent Scottish government. But more shocking is the report's mention that "the Governor [Mark Carney] had advised the Chancellor of the substance and implications of the Committee’s discussion." If this briefing included details of the private discussions between the PRA and Scottish banks, it may rekindle questions over the alleged "leak" of news before the referendum that the Royal Bank of Scotland planned to re-domicile to England if Scotland voted Yes.  Last month, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond called for a public inquiry after he accused the Treasury of leaking market sensitive information to the BBC in advance of informing the market.  FREE AppDownload
