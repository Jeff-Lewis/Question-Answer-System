REUTERS/ Kevork DjansezianWal-Mart announced Q4 adjusted earnings of $1.60 per share this morning, a penny higher than analysts' expectations. Guidance was fairly weak, and the early read on Q2 doesn't seem too promising. Management pointed to unfavorable external factors. But we can't ignore internal issues. Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, points to "five shocking aspects" of the report. From his note to clients:  "Wal-Mart is not one to acknowledge operating missteps," writes Sozzi. "The company went onto express confidence in positive U.S. comps for 1Q14 after underperforming its goal consistently in 2013, and beginning the quarter with weather and economic impacted negative comps."
