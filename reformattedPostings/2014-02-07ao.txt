Valentines Day, screenshotIt isn't that bankers are particularly insensitive people. It's just that they're very busy — and the way they see it, it's only Valentine's Day obviously, so their date will get over it, right? Wrong. Even if screwing up Valentine's Day doesn't end with tears and regret, it makes a big check mark on the "reasons-why-I'm-so-over this-relationship" tally. To avoid this, Business Insider reached out to veteran Wall Streeters to get a sense of what they've done horribly, horribly wrong on Valentine's Day and how they've tried to rectify it. Pro tip: You can't recover from having your assistant ask your date out for you. When the bankers ran out of ideas (it was quick), we turned to our friends at InsideHook, a men's lifestyle newsletter for gentlemen of a certain caliber — the caliber that does not ruin Valentine's Day. In fact, the Inside Hook man ends up in the Valentine's Day Hall of Fame. You want to get into the Hall of Fame. FREE AppDownload
