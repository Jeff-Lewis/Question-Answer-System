Facebook/deadrabbitnycSee where The Dead Rabbit made it on our list.New York City has over 2,000 bars, so it can be difficult to figure out which are the best places to grab a drink. From trendy cocktail bars to local dives, we've found the 10 best bars in New York City. This list is derived from our list of The Best Bars In America. To compile this list, we looked at six notable bar rankings— James Beard Awards, Esquire, Food &amp; Wine, Zagat, The World's 50 Best Bars, and Liquor.com's Best Bars in America—and aggregated the rankings to come up with our own list of the Best Bars in America. We used Yelp ratings as a tie-breaker. You can read more about our methodology here. FREE AppDownload
