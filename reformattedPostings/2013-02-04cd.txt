Bill Ackman will be happy when he wakes up today. Shares of Herbalife — the company on which he has a massive short position — are getting crushed in the pre-market.  Blame the New York Post for the selloff. Michelle Celarier at the paper is reporting that the company is subject to an FTC investigation: Embattled Herbalife is feeling the heat — and this time it isn’t coming from a hedge-fund mogul.  The Los Angeles-based distributor of nutritional products is the subject of a law enforcement investigation, The Post has learned.  The existence of the probe emerged after the Federal Trade Commission, responding to a Freedom of Information Law request by The Post. It's not clear at all from the report if anything will come of this. Basically there have been a lot of complaints over the years from people unhappy with the product/service. FREE AppDownload
