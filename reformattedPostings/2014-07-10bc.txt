On Wednesday, two players went up against each other with nearly equally great hands ... but only one came out on top. After a flop of J<U+2660> 3<U+2660> 2<U+2660>, Ronnie Bardah called Brian Tsang's check-raise. The next card was an A<U+2665>, which was enough for Ronnie Bardah. He decided to go all in with 83,900. Tsang called, and the two players revealed their cards — both had a flush. Bardah was holding A<U+2660> 10<U+2660>, while Tsang had 8<U+2660> 6<U+2660>. Tsang basically had no hope because Bardah was holding the ace. The river — or fifth card — was a 9<U+2660>, which solidified the win for Bardah. Ronnie Bardah finished 24th in the 2010 WSOP.
