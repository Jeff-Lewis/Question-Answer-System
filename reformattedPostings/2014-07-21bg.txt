Card-not-present transactions include e-commerce and mobile payment transactions, online bill pay, over-the-phone transactions, and the like — basically any card-based transaction made without presenting a physical card to a merchant. We arrived at our forecast based on data from the Federal Reserve, past growth trends, and our close tracking of the card payments industry.
