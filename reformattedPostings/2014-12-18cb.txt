Six Flags Over Texas/Facebook Near 1:00 pm ET on Thursday, the Dow was up 303 points, the S&amp;P 500 was up 34 points, and the Nasdaq was up 80 points. The rally in stocks comes after the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday had its best day of the year. That came after the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement, which saw the Fed say it would be "patient" in raising interest rates. Earlier Thursday, we got initial jobless claims data that beat expectations. Initial jobless claims fell to 289,000 from last week's 295,000, which was expected by economists.  Also Thursday, we got the flash reading on service sector activity from Markit Economics, which fell to 53.6 from 56.2 in November. Any reading over 50 indicates growth, though Thursday's number suggests the slowest rate of service sector expansion since October 2013. The latest manufacturing reading from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve came in at 24.5, below expectations and well off November's blowout 40.8 reading, which was a 21-year high. Stocks have had a rocky December, though many expected stocks to rally into the end of the year as part of the so-called "Santa Claus Rally." And so maybe Santa is here now.   FREE AppDownload
