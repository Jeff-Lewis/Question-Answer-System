REUTERS/Brendan McDermidEveryone is weighing in on Larry Summers' announcement that he is withdrawing his name for Fed chair. The latest is from The New York Times' Paul Krugman, who adds a personal note along with some punditry in a post called "Freedom Is Just Another Word For Nothing Left To Lose." First, he says President Obama must now pick Janet Yellen — in his opinion, she is simply the best candidate: "... it’s really, really hard to see how Obama can justify not picking Janet Yellen at this point. Nobody else is as qualified; any other choice would look like spite." He goes on to say that he feels bad for Larry Summers: "Just a personal reaction: I’ve known Larry for all our adult lives, and looking at this sad play I realize how lucky I am to have reached a place where I’m no longer in the rat race. Obviously I’m plenty combative, and in a way still ambitious too; I do track my Twitter followers, wonder how each column will do on the most-emailed list, and all that. But there are no promotions I’m seeking, no honors I desperately desire that I don’t already have." Very Zen of him. FREE AppDownload
