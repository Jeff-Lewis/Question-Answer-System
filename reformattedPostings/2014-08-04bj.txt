The old paper-based tools for making and accepting payments are being swept away by the rise of e-commerce, mobile commerce, smartphone apps, and mobile payment registers.  Recently, BI Intelligence published an 80-slide, 45-chart deck detailing how a wave of innovation is changing the way we pay. These are the five key points from that presentation, which explain the shift away from old payments technology (i.e., cash, checks, and physical card swipes).  Click here to sign up for BI Intelligence trial membership, and download the whole presentation and charts in PowerPoint, Excel, or PDF &gt; &gt;  1. The use of cash and checks is in decline.
