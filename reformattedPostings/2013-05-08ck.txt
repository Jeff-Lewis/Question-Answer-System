Most active managers prove their worth when the market declines.  But what about the other, oh, 75% of the time when the market is rising?  The reality is that being an active manager is incredibly difficult in an environment where the market seems to never go down.  If you’re not leveraged, strategically differentiated, lucky or unusually skilled the odds are heavily against an active manager outperforming a market like the one we’ve seen in 2013 where stocks just don’t go down.  But should the discrepancy look THIS bad?
