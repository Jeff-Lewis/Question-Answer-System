 Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger is the highest-paid president in the Ivy League, according to data compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Bollinger made $3,389,917 in 2012, the most recent year that financial documents are available for nonprofit institutions. The highest-paid college president in the country, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann Jackson, made more than $7 million that year, according to The Chronicle. Student newspaper The Columbia Daily Spectator has a great breakdown of how Bollinger made his more-than-$3,000,000 in 2012, including his $1,012,707 base salary. This year, The Chronicle changed its methodology to include only direct payments to the college presidents — such as their base salary, bonus, nontaxable benefits, and other reportable compensation. Because of the nature of nonprofit financial reports, these numbers are from a few years ago and paint a very different portrait of Ivy League leadership than the current one. Half of the names listed below are no longer president of their respective colleges — we've marked each former president with an asterisk.
