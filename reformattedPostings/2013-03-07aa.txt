Henry Blodget/Business InsiderSheryl Sandberg launched her global book tour tonight in New York City. New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Arianna Huffington threw Sheryl a big bash. And they were kind enough to invite me. So I went. I took some crappy pictures with my iPhone along the way, which I am going to risk assuming you would rather see than not see. (I apologize for their crappiness!)
