Billionaire energy mogul T. Boone Pickens will put your push-up game to shame.  The 86-year-old was the grand marshal at a number of events for Oklahoma State University's homecoming this past weekend. During the morning parade, he was cranking out push-ups while members of the ROTC carried him. It was impressive.  For the past 26 years, Pickens has been working out with his personal trainer every morning at 6:30. He also told us recently that he thought President Obama's workout routine was "pitiful."
