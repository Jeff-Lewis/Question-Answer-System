Oil trading "god" Andrew John Hall is leaving Phibro, a commodities-trading unit Occidental Petroleum purchased from Citigroup in 2009, Bloomberg News reports. According to the Bloomberg report, Hall will focus on his hedge fund, Astenback Capital Management, which he founded in 2010. The fund currently manages about $3 billion in assets.  Hall, a lengedary oil trader, became notorious as the leader of Phibro when he demanded a $100 million pay package from then-owner Citigroup during the financial crisis. Phibro, which has been around since 1901, laid off some of its US-based employees today, Reuters is reporting. The firm is also looking to sell some of its overseas operations. According to Reuters, some of the traders in the company's Westport, Conn. headquarters have been retained to help run Astenback Capital.       FREE AppDownload
