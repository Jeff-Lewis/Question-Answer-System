The first annual list of the best employers in America by PayScale and Business Insider evaluates companies by both pay and happiness. The winner is a company you've probably never heard of: a New Jersey biopharmaceutical company called Celgene Corporation. Many of the best companies were also in the health care industry. The famously indulgent tech industry also did well on this list, including Google (#2), Yahoo (#8), and Microsoft (#14).  Companies in the 2012 Fortune 500 were ranked using PayScale's salary and survey database. Happiness represented 57 percent of the final score and was measured through questions about satisfaction, feelings of meaningfulness, stress, and schedule flexibility. Pay represented 43 percent of the final score and was measured by looking at median pay after five years and pay compared to industry peers. FREE AppDownload
