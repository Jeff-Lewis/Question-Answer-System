Its Jobs Day, and official expectations are for a reading of 200K new jobs in March. But optimism is building that the number could be higher than that — perhaps significantly. @fullcarry on Twitter — who is an absolute must follow if you're on there — has put together a list of 10 reasons to expect a monster number today. Here they are: 10. Gallup's unemployment rate fell substantially between Feb and March. 9. Auto sales in March exceeded a 16 million annual rate. 8. ISM non-manufacturing's employment index made a huge recovery from Feb's below 50 reading. 7. Payroll tax withholding were running 8% higher this March vs March of last year. 6. Four week average of initial claims in March were close to the lowest of the recovery. 5. Yes, of course, weather payback will be a big factor. 4. Rasmussen's employment index reaches 6 year high. 3. Gallup job creation index reaches multi-month highs. 2. My bum of a nephew finally lands a job. And finally the number one reason to expect a blowout payroll number tomorrow is that we deserve it after a brutal Winter. FREE AppDownload
