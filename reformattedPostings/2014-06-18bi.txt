ShutterstockFinancial services professionals appear to be seeking the relative stability of a career in large U.S. institutions, with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and BlackRock topping the ranking of desirable firms to work for, according the results of a recent eFinancialCareers survey on career aspirations. This is not surprising – Goldman and JPMorgan regularly battle for the top spots in the global investment banking league tables, they’re still paying bonuses predominantly in cash (even up to $1m) and are among the few banks not to have retreated from any business areas. Given the option of working for any organisation, financial services professionals responding to the survey chose these two banks over any other firm. BlackRock, meanwhile, is the world’s largest asset management firm, with over $4.4 trillion in assets under management, and has been consistently adding to its headcount over the past couple of years. Less obvious entrants to the top ten are HSBC, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Barclays, however.  This article originally appeared at eFinancial Careers.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
