We've been seeing analysts increasingly talk about a "1994"-style situation playing out in the market. What does that mean? Basically, the market was caught off guard that year by a surprise Fed tightening, and Treasuries got hammered. Nobody expects a real "tightening" soon, but there is more talk about it, and there's a lot of talk about a "Great Rotation" from fixed income back to equity (though that might also be wishful thinking, as opposed to actual prognostication). Anyway, M&amp;G Investments on Twitter has a great few tweets about what happened to other markets in 1994. It's all well and good to talk about a jump in rates and carnage in fixed income, but if your neck of the woods is no better, then it doesn't matter. They observe. Various market commentators: "US treasury bond yields to explode higher. But don't worry, MY asset class will remain immune from this" The lesson of the 1994 bond bear market was that whilst USTs sold off, in many cases (eg Emerging Markets) risk assets sold off more... 1994 returns were: BAML US Treasury index -3.45%, MSCI EM equity index -8.67%, BAML EM Debt index -15.33% UST returns won't be so flattered in sell off this time as yields/income much lower. In 94 capital loss of over 10%, but total return -3.45% As for the S&amp;P 500, it gained 1.3% that year. FREE AppDownload
