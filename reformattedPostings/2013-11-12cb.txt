REUTERS/Neil Hall Last night, David Cameron gave a speech at a banquet calling for permanent austerity. From HuffPo: David Cameron has suggested that public spending should continue to be squeezed in a "fundamental culture change" that would leave the British public sector "permanently" slimmed down. Speaking at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in the City of London, he said the best way to keep the cost of living down was to take "difficult decisions on public spending" to leave "a state we can afford". What everyone is talking about though is the photo of Cameron making this call for lower spending. Among the items featured in the photo: Yay, austerity!
