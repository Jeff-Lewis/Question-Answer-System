Want to start a fight on Wall Street? Don't insult someone's stock tip, insult their steakhouse. It's basically a banker's second office, and the best ones inspire a fierce, unparalleled loyalty. A month ago we asked our readers to vote for their favorite steakhouses in New York City across ten categories including cut of steak, martini, sides, service, and atmosphere. Roughly 650 Business Insider readers took the survey. One restaurant destroyed them all: a decades-old, family-owned-and-operated, no-frills steakhouse in Williamsburg of all places. Do you agree?
