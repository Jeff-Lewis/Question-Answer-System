So, what are the oil market pros predicting for prices after the crash of 2014? Overall, they're expecting prices to go up. However, futures traders are positioned much more conservatively than what the professional oil price forecasters are predicting.

"Many clients share the view priced into the futures market that Brent will remain below $70 by year-end 2015. However, oil producers anticipate a rebound, echoing a Bloomberg survey of professional forecasters that expects Brent to rise by 35% to $82 at year-end 2015 (Exhibit 2)." Goldman's house view is that Brent eventually rallies to $85 a barrel. Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
