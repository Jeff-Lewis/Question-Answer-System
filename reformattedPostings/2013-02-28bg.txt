The Dow closed at an all-time high of 14,164 on October 9, 2007.  It hit an intra-day high of 14,198 on October 11, 2007. The S&amp;P 500 isn't too far from its all-time closing high of 1,565, which it also hit on October 9, 2007. This comes as major U.S. budget cuts loom and political uncertainty returns to Europe.
