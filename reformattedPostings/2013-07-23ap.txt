Apple delivered better than expected earnings results, giving the stock a little bump in after-hours trading.  It sold 31.1 million iPhones, which was well ahead of analyst expectations of 26 million units sold. On the earnings call, company executives attributed the strong iPhone number to accelerated iPhone 4 sales.  The success of the iPhone 4 was reflected in the iPhone's average selling price, which dipped to $581 for the quarter. The iPhone 4 is the three year old iPhone that's sold at a discount.  Despite the fall in the ASP, and the success of the iPhone, execs said the iPhone 5 remains the most popular iPhone by far.  The other number of note was iPad units of 14.6 million, which was below expectations, and represented a 14% unit decline. Execs said that if you look at actually sell through on the product, discounting inventory issues, then iPad sales were down 3%. The decline was due to a lack of new iPad in the quarter. The year prior, Apple released the iPad 3, with a Retina display which drove sales.  Overall, revenue was only up 1% for the quarter, and EPS was down 20% on a year-over-year basis.  In the release, CEO Tim Cook said, "We are laser-focused and working hard on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall and across 2014."

Tim Cook: iPad and iPhone reduced inventory, iPad down 700K. iPhone down 600K. As you know, we typically don't like to have any more inventory than we need. If we can reduce, we do so.&nbsp; Don't subscribe to view that higher end is at its peak. I don't believe that, but we'll see and we'll report out results as we go along.&nbsp; We feel really good about where we are. Incredible quarter in U.S. education. Double digit in china... Happy with what we saw. Tim: From iPhone point of view, we saw strong sales in emerging markets, India was up over 400%, Philipines up 140%, these were, storng in developed markets, iPhone up 50%, Japan 60%, in some cases iPhone acclerated, an unusual pattern for us.&nbsp; Hong Kong down, mainland China up 5%, but lower growth rate. I attribute to many things, including the econmy there doesn't help us or others. In Hong Kng, shopping haven. We saw more dramatic downturn there. Not clear why that occurred. Down on sell thru on 20%, weighed great China.&nbsp; Not opposed to it. I like environmental aspect. That part encouraging to me.&nbsp; More than one tool in the toolbox. It's a great way for a buyer to get into the iOS ecosystem.&nbsp; We start at the product, believe most important customer love product and wants them, if not at that level create things people don't want.&nbsp; During June quarter, we concluded $2 billion ASR program. Final shares in on that. Second ASR of $12 billion started at end of April. Fiscal 14 that will close. Bought $4 billion on open market, about 9 million shares. Impact, 22.9 million shares.
