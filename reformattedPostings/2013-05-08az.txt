He's gave a bullish case on Procter &amp; Gamble.   Pershing Square owns almost 30 million shares of P&amp;G.  He said they think it's one of the "great businesses" in the world. He said it's vastly under-earning relative to its intrinsic earnings power.  Last year at Sohn, Ackman pitched going long JCPenney.  The stock has fallen about 35% since then.   Check here for full conference coverage &gt; FREE AppDownload
