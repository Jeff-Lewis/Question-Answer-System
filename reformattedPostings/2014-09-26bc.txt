Wikimedia Commons Bill Gross is leaving PIMCO for Janus Capital. Gross is leaving the firm after a period of turmoil at PIMCO and will take over the Janus Unconstrained Bond Fund, which currently has about $13 million in assets under management. At PIMCO, Gross managed the Total Return Fund, which has more than $221 billion in assets under management. On Friday following the news, several of PIMCO's closed-end funds were taking it on the chin. US-listed shares of Allianz, which owns PIMCO, were also down more than 6.5% on Friday.  A closed-end bond fund has a few traits that make it vulnerable in a moment like this. For one, closed-end funds can't accept new money after they begin trading on an exchange. Also, they trade on an exchange. Unlike a traditional open-end mutual fund, a closed-end fund is listed on a stock exchange and trades like a stock, trading usually either at a discount or premium to its net asset value.  The drop in PIMCO's closed-end funds also comes after a report from AllianceBernstein said it expected assets under management at PIMCO to fall 10% to 30% in the wake of Gross' departure.  Here is the ugly action in a few of PIMCO's closed-end funds as investors rush for the exits. Here's the PIMCO High Income Fund, down more than 8.5% in trading on Friday.
