Photo courtesy of Sara EisenStar reporter Sara Eisen joined CNBC from Bloomberg TV late last year. She's been crushing it since moving there. Eisen is well-known for her coverage of the foreign exchange. At CNBC, she's a correspondent focusing on the global consumer. She's still really into forex, though. We asked Eisen to take us through her typical day at CNBC. She showed us her routine of what she does when she wakes up and how she gets her hair and make up done.  She even showed us what she does before she goes to bed.  FREE AppDownload
