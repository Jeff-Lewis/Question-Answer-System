New York City is home to 8.4 million waste-producing people; that's a lot of toilets, drains, and sewers. It takes 14 wastewater treatment facilities scattered throughout the five boroughs to clean up all of our dirty water.  We visited the largest facility, the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to see how the water is treated. It's a dirty job that surprisingly smells great.  Produced by Sam Rega. Additional camera by Justin Gmoser. Follow BI Video: On Facebook
