@Carl_C_IcahnOkay, honestly, we don't know what to make of this. Carl Icahn has issued a statement after the 2nd postponement of the Dell shareholder vote (via MarketWatch). "A statement regarding my reaction to the Dell situation can be accessed on my Twitter account: @Carl_C_Icahn. Follow my Twitter account; other Tweets to follow. We will be issuing a comprehensive statement on the Dell situation later today." We're hoping for something with more of Icahn's characteristic dynamism later. He has a lot to be riled up about, after all — it looks like the Dell committee may change voting rules in favor Michael Dell and Silver Lake if the latter up their offer for the company to $14 a share. In the meantime, if you don't have Twitter... get it? FREE AppDownload
