Nothing special is going on today. It's just that markets are gaining all around the world. The global risk-on train continues. Japan more than erased yesterday's losses, with the Nikkei rallying 2.4%. In Europe, markets are up again. France is up 0.7%. Germany is up 1%. Italy is up 1%. US futures are currently doing fine, rising about 0.5%. As noted, there's nothing else special. The big fireworks come tomorrow when we get Bernanke's speech on the history of the Fed.
