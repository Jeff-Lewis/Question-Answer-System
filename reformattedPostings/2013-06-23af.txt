Matonis' bio says he himself is on the board of the Bitcoin foundation. The agency charges the Foundation with allegedly "engaging in the business of money transmission without a license or proper authorization." You can read the full letter here. It's an odd development, since the Foundation doesn't actually perform any wire transfers, but rather serves as a kind of custodian of, or advocate for, the Bitcoin universe. It's also registered in Washington D.C. and has a mailing address in Seattle, Matonis says. Matonis himself serves on the board of the Foundation and says it remains unclear whether other Bitcoin-related firms have received similar letters. The Department is closed Sundays.
