MN Chan / Getty Images Lakeland Industries, which makes hazmat suits and other industrial protective gear, has seen shares gain more than 40% since the first case of Ebola was confirmed in the US last Tuesday. In afternoon trade on Tuesday, the stock was up nearly 20%. Shares of numerous drugmakers, including Tekmira, BioCryst, and Chimerix, have been rallying as the virus has spread throughout the summer. Each of these companies is working on a cure for Ebola, but to date the most popular experimental treatment for the virus is manufactured by privately held Mapp Pharmaceuticals.  Tekmira's TKM-Ebola has been used to treat at least one patient, but according to the Associated Press, the supply of that drug remains limited.  In contrast, shares of some travel-related companies have been hurt by fears that Ebola will hamper international travel, with numerous European airline and cruise stocks falling after officials confirmed that a nurse in Spain contracted the first case of Ebola outside of West Africa.  Here's a chart showing the recent moves in Lakeland stocks as Ebola news has broken over the past week or so.  Google Finance  FREE AppDownload
