For the S&amp;P 500, the forward P/E was at 13.5 on Friday. Monthly data show that the ratio of the forward P/E to consensus expected long-term earnings growth (which tends to have an upwards bias) was 1.26 during February. That’s about the same as the 1.21 average of this PEG ratio since 1985. Another useful valuation measure is the ratio of the market value of all stocks traded in the US to nominal GDP. It is highly correlated with the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 divided by S&amp;P 500 revenues. Both of these measures have recovered from their lows of 2009, but remain well below their previous two cyclical peaks.
