flickr: are you my rik?US home sales rose to an annualized rate of 5.18 million in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. It's the highest reading since Nov. 2009. And it's 12.9 percent above the 4.59 million-unit pace in May 2012. Consensus was for an annualized rate of 5 million. The median price was $208,000, up 15.4% YOY and the sixth-straight month of double-digit increases. It's also the strongest gain since Oct. 2005. "The home price growth is too fast, and only additional supply from new homebuilding can moderate future price growth,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said. The housing numbers are overwhelmingly positive.  However, the number of available homes is unlikely to grow, despite a nice gain in May, unless new home construction ramps up quickly by an additional 50 percent,” he said. Total housing inventory rose 3.3$ to 2.22 million existing homes available for sale, or a 5.1-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 5.2 months in April. Listed inventory is 10.1 percent below a year ago, when there was a 6.5-month supply. Click here for updates &gt; FREE AppDownload
