APDespite growing acceptance of the LGBT community in corporate America, more than 50 Fortune 500 companies scored zero out of a potential 100 points on the Corporate Equality Index 2014 when it came to being LGBT-friendly, according to data from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Here’s how corporate America’s take on LGBT issues has evolved over the past decade:  Each company on the Fortune 500 was given a score based on a survey they took last year, said Deena Fidas, a researcher who worked on this project. For example, a company could gain 10 points by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual discrimination, and another 15 points if they offered same-sex domestic partners health benefits. Companies could also lose 25 points if they had a “large-scale official or anti-LGBT blemish” on their recent records. Two companies — Exelis and MRC Global — on the Fortune 500 list refused to answer the survey that was sent out last year, said Fidas. Exelis is a global aerospace, defense and informations company, and MRC Global a global distributor of pipe, valve and fitting products and services to the energy and industrial markets. “Neither company has filled out the survey despite repeated outreach efforts and invitations,” she wrote in an email.
