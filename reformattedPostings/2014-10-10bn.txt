At an event in Los Angeles on Thursday night, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the new model, which has three settings: Normal, Sport, and Insane. Business Insider's Matthew DeBord has the full report from the event. In response, the market appears to be "selling the news," which followed a cryptic tweet from Musk on October that it was "about time to unveil the D and something else." Tesla shares were trading at about $245 on Friday morning, about $40 below where they were when Musk said the stock was overvalued back in early September.  FREE AppDownload
