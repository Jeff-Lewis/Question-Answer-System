Shake ShackShake Shack just filed for its IPO.  When a company files for an IPO, they give away all kinds of great details not just about how the business is doing, but the philosophy behind the business.  Buried in Shake Shack's filing is a disclosure that it refers to its employees at "51%ers." Here's Shake Shack: We believe that the culture of our team is the single most important factor in our success. We aim to recruit and develop a team with the innate "personality to please" that cannot be taught. We look for people who are warm, friendly, motivated, caring, self-aware and intellectually curious team members, or what we call "51%'ers." We use the term "51%" to describe the emotional skills needed to thrive at the job and "49%" to describe the technical skills needed for the job. Our 51%'ers are excited and committed to championship performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture and actively growing themselves and the brand.  In its filing, the company also touts the "Shack Pact," which it displays in its stores for employees to see and is what the company calls, "the agreement we make with ourselves and with each other to uphold our principles and to hold each other accountable." Here's the "Shack Pact": Shack Shake also pays it employees more than minimum wage (though 1,450 of the company's 1,680 employees are hourly), saying in its filing that in Manhattan, for example, it starts employees at $10 per hour though minimum wage is $8 in New York. In its filing, the company said it believes this allows it "to attract a higher caliber employee and this translates directly to better guest service."  Since 2010, annual revenue has increased from $19.5 million to more than $83 million through just the first nine months of this year.  So it seems like regardless of what Shake Shack is calling its employees, the business is growing.  FREE AppDownload
