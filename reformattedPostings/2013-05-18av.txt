Leroy W. Demery, Jr.Today, we all know Taiwan as a Pacific powerhouse that provides the world with everything from PCs to basic metals to cameras. But for decades after World War II, the country remained something of a backwater, having been founded by refugees from the Chinese Civil War who subsequently imposed de facto martial law for 40 years. Public transit expert Leroy W. Demery Jr. journeyed to Taiwan in 1980 to examine how the country's investments in its rail sector was progressing, and took photos of his visit. We've shown you Demery's work from his visits to Asia previously. These photos show the country in the early stages of its modernization and industrialization campaign — no longer an obscure, undeveloped island, but still not quite the gleaming, skyscraper-boasting megalopolis we know today.   For hardcore Taiwan and/or public transit geeks, here is Leroy's introduction to his photo set:  I arrived at Táibei airport from Hong Kong on 1980 July 18, a Friday afternoon. My primary interest was the then-new electrification of the (<U+81FA><U+5317> / <U+53F0><U+5317>) Táibei - (<U+9AD8><U+96C4>) Gaoxióng railway. Timetable information was scarce, but it appeared that I could circle the island and visit the Alishan Forestry Railway "over the weekend," as we say.
