Corcoran GroupThe 20 villages of the Hamptons have long been a destination for New York's "it" crowd, and there are plenty of historic mansions to prove it.  Southampton's Normandy House, designed in 1923 and constructed over a seven-year period, was just sold to an unknown buyer for $28 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.
