AP ImagesOne of the more popular sports played by finance professionals after work and on the weekends is squash.  Forbes magazine once called the racquet sport the "preferred sport on Wall Street" because it doesn't take long to complete a match.  So we decided to highlight some of the top players on Wall Street. Many of these folks were national champions, All-Americans and internationally ranked.  Some of them are playing professionally still, while others are remembered as legends from their squash days.    If we're missing any big names, please feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com. Please be sure to include a photo of the player, too.   FREE AppDownload
