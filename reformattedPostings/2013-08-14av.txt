APWall Street's chart gurus have spotted the ominous "Hindenburg Omen" in the stock market today. Today's sighting is the sixth one in just eight days, and that's pretty significant for folks who believe history repeats itself. Last week, SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert discussed the clustering of Hindenburg Omens. Here's an excerpt via UBS's Art Cashin (It's still relevant today): With the latest market rally, the Omens are flaring up again.  There have been 5 Omens triggered out of the past 8 trading sessions (your data may vary - we're using the same sources we've always used for historical data).  That's actually the closest-grouped cluster since early November 2007. It's extremely rare to see as many Omens occurring together as we've seen over the past 50 days.  The last time was prior to the bear market in 2007.  The time before that was prior to the bear market in 2000. So, what exactly is the Hindenburg Omen? As Goepfert suggests, not everyone has the same definition.  But here's Wikipedia's criteria: Doomers will argue that this only supports their case for a major 1987-style sell-off. But Art Cashin warns that this obviously isn't a sure thing. "The viewers should be alert to it, but they shouldn't be panicked," said Cashin in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. "It is a signal that says they may have a serious sell-off not they must have a serious sell-off." The Dow is down by around 65 points in early afternoon trading. FREE AppDownload
