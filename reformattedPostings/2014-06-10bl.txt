Wikimedia CommonsRadioShack shares were down as much as 21% in premarket trading after the electronics retailer reported a wider than expected quarterly loss. The company posted a net loss of $98.3 million, or $0.97 a share. Analysts were looking for a loss of $0.52 per share. Revenue fell 13% from a year ago to $736.7 million and on a same-store basis, sales fell 14%, which the company said was driven by traffic declines and poor sales in its mobile business. Analysts were expecting revenue of $767.5 million. The electronics retailer said it ended the quarter with total liquidity of $423.7 million, including $61.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $361.9 million available under a credit agreement.   "Overall, our first quarter performance was challenged by an industry-wide decline in consumer electronics and a soft mobility market which impacted traffic trends throughout the quarter," chief executive Joseph Magnacca said in a statement.  Magnacca added that the company has taken steps to cut costs, including lowering its corporate head count and reducing discretionary expenses.
