Getty Images/Andrew BurtonThe Bureau of Labor Statistics has released its October Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). US companies had 3.925 million jobs openings in October, up from 3.883 million in September. This was a bit higher than the 3.898 million openings estimated by economists. During the month, 4.509 million people were hired, down from 4.632 million the month prior. Also, 4.249 million were separated from their jobs. The quit rate was unchanged at 1.7%. "Job openings, separations, and hirings continue to move sideways," said UBS's Sam Coffin ahead of the report. "Labor market turnover does not appear to have picked up significantly, suggesting continued labor market strains. (For the most part, employees cling to the jobs they have, although the quits rate has risen somewhat.)" FREE AppDownload
