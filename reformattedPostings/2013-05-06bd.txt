Current TVOver the last decade and a half, former Vice President Al Gore has amassed a personal fortune that rivals former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's, Bloomberg's Ken Wells and Ari Levy report. Gore wasn't even a multi-millionaire when he ran for office against George W. Bush in the 2000 election, but several recent moves have put his personal fortune at a point where it "may exceed $200 million," according to Bloomberg: Gore's wealth, according to Bloomberg, approaches that of Romney, who is worth about $250 million.

They have not been able to regulate these phony baloney financial derivatives that caused the financial crisis. They voted to invade Iraq even though Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Unfortunately there are a lot of examples. They can't pass a budget. I can't keep the country from facing financial danger and the main reason is simple, the influence of the money is at un-healthy levels." Read the whole Bloomberg piece here &gt; FREE AppDownload
