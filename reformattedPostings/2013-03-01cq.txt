This Great Graphic was posted on the FT Alphaville, which in turn appears to have gotten it from Credit Suisse, who relied on Thomson Reuters data. A prevalent monetarist argument is that foreign exchange prices should reflect the relative changes in the stock of money.  This is part of the reason why some many expect QE to be negative for a currency.  This is especially true of the US, where many expect the aggressiveness of QE3+ (QE infinity in derision) to have undermined the dollar.  We showed in an earlier post that the actual performance of the dollar since QE3+  was announced in mid-September is not what many would have expected.  And more:  if one ignored QE completely and instead focused on ECB and EU efforts to reduce boost confidence that EMU is not about to implode or cease and the chasing of fund managers who were caught wrong-footed (first being under weight European bonds and stocks then being underweight Japanese equities) one have a better chance of understanding what is driven the dollar.
