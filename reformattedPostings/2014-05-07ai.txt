That also beat forecasts of $53.4 million. The firm raised its full-year 2014 guidance to 500-500 megawatts deployed versus a prior statement of 475-525. And they expect 2015 to basically double that, at 900-1,000 megawatts. They also said they'd set a new quarterly record of booking 136 megawatts-worth of projects, most of it residential, adding 17,664 customers in Q1. They "remain firmly on track to meet [its] one million customer target by mid-2018."  Adjusted earnings missed by a penny at $0.82 net oss-per-share versus $0.81 expected. Management projects a slower Q2, with adjusted loss per share of $0.90-$1.  The company confirmed it had added a 15th state, Nevada, to its coverage area.
