This is a truly amazing chart from Markit, the organization that publishes all of the monthly PMI manufacturing reports. It shows the divergence between the French survey and the German survey. As we've reported, German PMI surged in January, while the French PMI tanked. The trend is extraordinary. Whereas German output is rebounding sharply since the middle of last year, France has gone into flatline. Both countries are the pillars of "core" Europe, but right now they're seeing vastly different fates.  FREE AppDownload
