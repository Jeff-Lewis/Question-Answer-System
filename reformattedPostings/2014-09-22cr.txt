The whole thing seems incredibly suspicious for the world's second-largest retailer (by profits and revenues). Tesco's shares have crashed more than 11%, and here's everything we know so far:  Lewis has been in retail with Unilever and Tesco for nearly three decades, so the fact that he has never seen such an issue is a brutal indictment, confirming that this isn't some sort of run-of-the-mill mistake. The refusal by Broadbent and Lewis to say the £250 million is the final extent of the problem could also give some backing to analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, who said that they think the overstatement might be closer to £300 million.  With more than half a million employees at Tesco, and a new chief executive with a reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, we may be seeing more grim updates from the massive retailer in the near future.     FREE AppDownload
