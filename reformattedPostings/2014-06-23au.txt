Rich people care more about animal welfare than human rights, and about a dozen other important causes, according to a new report from consultancy Capgemini. The firm interviewed more than 4,500 high-net-worth individuals from 23 different markets during Q1 of this year to get their take on a number of subjects, including what social issues they care about most. Besides human rights, the respondents also said they cared more about animal welfare than climate change, poverty alleviation, income inequality and race and gender issues.
