A suspicious package has been found at LaGuardia Airport in New York City, according to Bloomberg News. One terminal was evacuated but the evacuation was later cancelled, Bloomberg reports. NBC New York reports that the airport was given the "all clear" around 15 minutes after it was evacuated. An email from Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the central terminal building (Terminal D) had been evacuated. Coleman says that the Port Authority Police Department’s Emergency Services Unit and the New York City Police Department’s bomb squad went to the scene. NBC New York reports that the package was in a shopping area in the terminal. WABC-TV reports some more details about the package: Sources tell Eyewitness News an electrical device was found at a phone booth on the upper level departure of Terminal B, known as central terminal. Sources add next to the bag is a substance that looks like marijuana. The source adds wires appear to be coming from the bag. According to Huffington Post's Ethan Klapper, the FAA has issued a ground stop (which prohibits all planes from flying) until at least noon EDT.
