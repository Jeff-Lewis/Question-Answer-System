Yesterday, we brought you U-Haul's list of top U.S. destinations for movers. Houston won, followed by Orlando and Chicago. But U-Haul has also put out a list of cities with the largest proportion of inbound moves to outbound moves in 2012. By this count, Pittsburgh saw the most growth, followed by Vegas suburb Henderson and Austin. That compares with 2011's ranking, which saw Nashville, Oakland and Denver on top.  Pittsburgh didn't even make the list that year! Here's the full 2012 list: RANK CITY %GROWTH   1.
