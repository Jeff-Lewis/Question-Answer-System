IMDB / Rambo IIThis is not Jefferies' Sean DarbyNobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller made a name for himself when he predicted the dotcom bubble using his now-famous CAPE ratio. CAPE is short for cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio. It's calculated by taking the S&amp;P 500 and dividing it by the average of ten years worth of earnings.  If the ratio is above the long-term average of around 16, the stock market is considered expensive. Shiller has argued that the CAPE is remarkably good at predicting returns over the period of several years. As the stock market has drifted to all-time highs, prices have outpaced earnings growth and the CAPE his risen to a notable 24 times. Some folks warn that that this means the odds of a crash have risen significantly. Check it out: Jefferies But Jefferies' Sean Darby isn't having this. "There are a number of reasons that investors should be careful relying solely on one valuation model to determine whether the equity market is under or overvalued," said Darby. In a new note to clients, he lays out a five-point takedown of the CAPE-toting crash mongers. From his note (emphasis added): In a nutshell, CAPE doesn't adjust skews, companies have tons of cash, stocks don't have to fall for CAPE to mean-revert, other measures of earnings are more reasonable, and there's hindsight bias. One thing that Darby left out is that the whole principle of CAPE could fall apart. "Things can go for 200 years and then change," warned another CAPE expert. "I even worry about the 10-year P/E — even that relationship could break down." That expert: Robert Shiller. FREE AppDownload
