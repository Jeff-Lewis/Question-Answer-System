Clashes erupted in Istanbul after thousands of police were stationed to block access to Taksim Square in the center of Turkey's largest city, Reuters reports. The barricades were set up to prevent a march organized by trade unions, but protestors began pushing into the square and authorities responded with tear gas and water cannons. Here's the Hurriyet Daily News report. Istanbul is on a citywide shut down as traffic has been restricted and public transportation to the square has been suspended. Reuters notes that May 1, a traditional workers' day holiday across Europe, was canceled as a national holiday in Turkey following a 1980 coup but reinstated in 2010 under pressure from trade unions.
