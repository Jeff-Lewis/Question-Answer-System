Claire P./flickrWe just learned the unemployment rate climbed for the first time in six months, to 6.2%.   This was ostensibly for the "right reasons": More people are joining the labor force, on the assumption that eventually they'll be able to find work.  But the unemployment rate fell for one group, for bad reasons: People with bachelor's degrees. For this cohort, the unemployment rate fell to 3.1% from 3.3%. The labor force participation rate fell back to 74.7%, the lowest level since March; it was 75.2% in June.

And the overall civilian labor force for those with bachelor's fell by 28,000.  For everyone else — those who have or have not completed high school, along with folks with some college — either their total civilian labor force climbed, or their participation rate climbed.
