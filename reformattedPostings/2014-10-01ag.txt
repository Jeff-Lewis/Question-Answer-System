DirecTVThe Sunday Ticket menu. DirecTV and the NFL have reached an agreement on "Sunday Ticket," giving DirecTV the exclusive right to show every NFL game each week.  Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  According to Reuters, citing a source familiar with the agreement, DirecTV will pay the NFL an average of $1.5 billion per year for "Sunday Ticket" over 8 years. Reaching this agreement was a requirement for the completion of AT&amp;T and DirecTV's $48.5 billion merger, which was recently approved by AT&amp;T shareholders and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015.  In a regulatory filing, AT&amp;T included a clause that allowed the company to walk away from its deal to acquire DirecTV if the company could not reach an agreement with the NFL for the "Sunday Ticket" package. In after hours trade, shares of DirecTV were up as much as 2% and AT&amp;T shares were fractionally higher.  Here's the full release from DirecTV and the NFL: NEW YORK &amp; EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The National Football League and DIRECTV have extended and expanded DIRECTV's exclusive rights to carry NFL SUNDAY TICKET and its package of every Sunday afternoon out-of-market game through a new multi-year agreement.
