Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have filed criminal charges against former KPMG partner Scott London. KPMG recently fired London, for allegedly leaking non-public information on Herbalife and Sketchers. London is said to have tipped off a third party, which the SEC alleges is his friend Bryan Shaw. Shaw reportedly made over $1.2 million trading off those tips. Now CNBC has tweeted an image from the SEC complaint that seems to show London  allegedly receiving one of many $5,000 payments for the information from Shaw. CNBC reports that London typically got 10 percent of Shaw's profits. An SEC press release said Shaw gave London at least $50,000 in cash, a Rolex watch, jewelry, meals and tickets to entertainment.
