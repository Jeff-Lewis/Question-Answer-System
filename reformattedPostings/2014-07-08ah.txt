Douglas Elliman/ Evan JosephA penthouse at Skylofts on Hudson Street in TriBeCa that looks like a glass cube has returned to the market with a $48 million listing price, according to The New York Daily News. The  four-bedroom, 4.5 bathroom apartment has 360-degree views of Manhattan and the Hudson River. It's being sold by William Duker, a private investor who did a stint in prison for defrauding the government. He's never lived in the stunning condo, according to the NYDN. It's being marketed by Tal and Oren Alexander of Douglas Elliman. Meredith Galante contributed to this story.
