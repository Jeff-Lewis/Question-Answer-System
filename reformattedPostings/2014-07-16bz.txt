This is also the first time the index climbed above 50 since January. Moreover all three components of the HMI climbed as well. "An improving job market goes hand-in-hand with a rise in builder confidence," NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said in a press release."As employment increases and those with jobs feel more secure about their own economic situation, they are more likely to feel comfortable about buying a home." Homebuilder confidence took a hit early this year on the back of a severe winter. But improving weather and pent-up demand has helped boost homebuilder confidence. A reading over 50 shows that more builders view conditions as good than poor. Pantheon Macroeconomics FREE AppDownload
