REUTERS/ Mike SegarA great commencement or class-day speech sticks with you forever. You remember it when you accept for your first job, and when you quit it. Too many, unfortunately, offer the same warmed-over clichés, like "dream big," "work hard," or "follow your passion."  But there are some lessons that are truly worth remembering, or so well-said that they stick in the memory longer than just about anything else.  We've collected some of the greatest speeches and pieces of advice, worth reading and listening to for any grad, or anyone looking for guidance.  Links to the full speeches and transcripts are provided, when available.
