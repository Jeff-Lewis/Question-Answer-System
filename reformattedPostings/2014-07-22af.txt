Electronic ArtsSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc reported higher revenue and profit for the first quarter, driven by robust sales of its "Titanfall" game, digital sales and cost control. For the three months ended June 30, the company posted non-GAAP revenue of $775 million, compared with $495 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income rose to $61 million, or 19 cents per share, from a loss of $121 million, or 40 cents per share, a year ago. "It was a strong start to the year for Electronic Arts. We are committed to putting our players first and delivering the entertainment, innovation and creativity that our players want," said Chief Executive OfficerAndrew Wilson. "Through exciting new titles and fresh content in our live services, we are well-positioned to deliver on that commitment in FY15 and beyond." Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a note before the earnings that EA has a good lineup this year, but that "quality issues remain a concern," referring to flailing games, such as "Medal of Honor" and "NBA Live."
