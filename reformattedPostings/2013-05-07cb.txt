Tech pundits are still weighing in on Google's computerized glasses, Google Glass. Assessments are all over the map. But getting a free version of a new gadget, or being rich enough that you can plunk down $1,500 for one, is very different from actually choosing to buy one as a normal person. And that, for any new gadget, is where the rubber meets the road. So what's the current consensus for future Google Glass sales? According to a poll we ran over the weekend, the consensus is that there really isn't a consensus. The assessments, again, are all over the map. If there is a bias, though, it's to the negative. More people think Google Glass is going to flop that think it's going to be a runaway hit. Specifically, more than a quarter of people expect Google to sell less than a million units of Glass (or equivalent) in three years. More than half expect Google to sell less than 8 million units a year. Given the early excitement around the technology, both of those outcomes would be considered a flop. Meanwhile, 14% of people think Google will sell more than 80 million units a year in three years. That sales level would be a massive home run.
