Japan's third-biggest automaker by revenue booked 164.4 billion yen ($1.52 billion) in operating profit for July-September, compared with a 184.1 billion yen mean estimate of 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The automaker also kept its forecast for the full year ending March 31 at 770 billion yen. The result comes as U.S. consumers announced a lawsuit against Honda in relation to its recall of over 5 million cars carrying potentially defective airbags from Takata Corp . Last week, Honda also apologized for the fifth domestic recall of its Fit hybrid subcompact and said it would re-examine its process for developing cars. Shares of Honda closed 0.7 percent lower before the earnings release, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index .
