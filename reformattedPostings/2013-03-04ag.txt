Gurdonark via FlickrNational home prices are expected to climb 0.6 percent in the next year, according to the latest home price report by Fiserv Case-Shiller. But over the next five years, home prices are expected to rise 3.3 percent. We drew on Fiserv Case-Shiller's latest data to identify the best housing markets for the next five years. The top 15 cities are ranked by the projected annualized change in home prices between Q3 2012 and Q3 2017. We also included the median home price, median household income, unemployment rate, and the change in home prices since their peak, to offer a broader view of the local economy and housing market. Note: The median family income and home price is for Q3 2012. Unemployment data is as of December 2012, and population data for the metros is for 2011. Correction: The Norwich-New London data was corrected to reflect  7.1% increase in home prices in the next five years. FREE AppDownload
