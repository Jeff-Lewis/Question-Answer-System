Goldman Sachs is the biggest employer of the Yale University Class of 2014 — aside from the university itself — hiring 23 new graduates of the Ivy League school, The Yale Daily News reports. The data comes from an annual survey of Yale seniors put together by the university's Office of Career Strategy. According to the YDN, 1,225 of the 1,298 Class of 2014 members have responded — almost 95% of students. According to the OCS survey, the YDN reports, "73.3 percent of the class currently holds a full-time, part-time or short-term position, while others are conducting independent research, traveling, volunteering or performing military service or care work ... Taking 16.6 percent of the class, financial services was once again the most popular industry for Yale graduates." Goldman Sachs hired the most Yale graduates, 23, while McKinsey &amp; Company hired 21, Bain &amp; Company hired 18, and Microsoft hired 13. One Yale junior — who interned for Goldman Sachs after her freshman year — told the YDN that "she thinks Yalies are drawn to Goldman Sachs because of its intellectually stimulating environment." "[Working at Goldman Sachs] is high-reward and relatively low-risk," the student said.
