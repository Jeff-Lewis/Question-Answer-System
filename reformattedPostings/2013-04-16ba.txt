Flickr/Paul BeattieThe New Yorker has an awesome interactive infographic showing the median income of New York's 21 subway lines based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The wealthiest subway stops are all in one census tract downtown: Park Place on the 123 line, Chambers Street on the 123 and ACE, and the World Trade Center on the E line. These three stops all have median incomes of $205,192. The next stops with the highest median incomes include 5th Avenue-59th Street on the NQR ($171,000), Williamsburg's York Street on the F line ($167,737), and Canal Street on the ACE line ($164,656). Some of the poorest subway stops include 125th on the 456 ($15,625) and Marcy Avenue on the M, J, and Z lines ($16,139). The infographic does an excellent job of demonstrating how dramatically income changes in New York City between neighborhoods.
