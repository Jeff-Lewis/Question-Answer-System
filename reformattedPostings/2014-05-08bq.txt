Once it has made the latest payment in June, it will have returned $126.8 billion to taxpayers in return for the $116.1 billion in taxpayer aid it received after being placed under the government's wing at the height of the financial crisis. The company, the nation's largest source of mortgage funds, earned a net income of $5.3 billion during the first three months of the year. It cited revenue from litigation related to private-label securities and fees they charge lenders to guarantee loans for the performance.
