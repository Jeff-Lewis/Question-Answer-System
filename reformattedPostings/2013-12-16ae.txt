The Federal Reserve will hold it's next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting from December 16-17. Among other things, they will decide whether or not to begin tapering quantitative easing, the monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of bonds. This program was launched to stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates low and credit markets liquid. The incoming economic data has been good. However, economists aren't sure the Fed will announce tapering this week. (Although they will acknowledge that the odds of a Dec-taper are up.) "The best argument for a December taper is the risk that economic data weaken before the January 28-29 FOMC meeting, closing what is now an open window for scaling back QE," wrote Neal Soss in his FOMC preview. "The best argument against a December taper is the reduced market participation and liquidity around the holidays, which pose an extra hurdle to significant year-end policy changes." "Our assumption remains that the next monetary policy move will be toward fewer asset purchases balanced by strengthened forward guidance on retaining low policy interest rates," he added. "And the likely timing of such a decision now appears to be practically a toss-up between December and January." A "toss-up."  That's not very satisfying. But Soss's reasons for and against a Dec-taper are evenly split. From his note (verbatim): More reasons to taper in December. More reasons not to taper in December... For now, the consensus continues to bet on a taper announcement occurring some time in early 2014. FREE AppDownload
