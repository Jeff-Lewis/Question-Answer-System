Thomson ReutersZuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, gestures during his conference at Seminar "Mexico Siglo XXI", organized by Telmex foundation, in Mexico CityBy Christine Murray MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Facebook Inc  is prepared to spend billions of dollars to reach its goal of bringing the Internet to everyone on the planet, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday. "What we really care about is connecting everyone in the world," Zuckerberg said at an event in Mexico City hosted by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. "Even if it means that Facebook has to spend billions of dollars over the next decade making this happen, I believe that over the long term its gonna be a good thing for us and for the world." Around 3 billion people will have access to the Internet by the end of 2014, according to International Telecommunications Union (ITU) statistics. Almost half that, 1.3 billion people, use Facebook. Facebook, the world's largest social networking company, launched its Internet.org project last year to connect billions of people without Internet access in places such as Africa and Asia by working with phone operators. "I believe that ... when everyone is on the Internet all of our businesses and economies will be better," Zuckerberg said.  (Editing by Simon Gardner and Richard Chang) FREE AppDownload
