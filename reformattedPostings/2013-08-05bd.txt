REUTERS/Rick WilkingBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett pauses during a bridge game in Omaha May 5, 2013 the day after the company's annual meeting.Last week was incredibly busy for economic events, and it ended with a disappointing jobs report and the stock market closing at an all-time high. This week will be far less busy. Perhaps this is a good time for investors to look over the economic data and consider the positioning of their portfolios. One thing's for sure: It has been paying off to be a long-term bull. On Friday, we learned that Berkshire Hathaway's Q2 financial results were better than expected. The results included $390 million in unrealized gains on Warren Buffett's massive long-term derivative bet on the global stock markets. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Citi's Tobias Levkovich is concerned about a worrisome trend developing in the stock market: "Intra-stock correlation of the top 50 market cap names has plunged in the past month. Investors look to be at risk given the collapse of intra-stock correlation from 66% at the end of June to just 18% at the month's end in July which suggests that investors might be overly focused on stock picking and have begun to ignore broader influences such as Fed policy, market valuation, European growth trends, economic surprise indices and the like. Very high readings on intra-stock correlation tend to generate an intriguing buy signal as seen in September 2011, while low levels suggest a degree of complacency that puts fund managers at risk for a correction."
