eBay has responded to investor Carl Icahn's second letter shredding the company's board of directors, saying that Icahn's claims against Marc Andreessen and others are "dead wrong." For context, Icahn has been waging a written war against eBay's board of directors this week, especially slamming Andreessen (a board member and co-founder of the huge VC firm Andreessen Horowitz). Icahn is accusing Andreessen of failing to have the company's best interests in mind in two past deals involving Skype and Keynetic. He claims that Andreessen essentially cost eBay shareholders $4 billion for his own personal profit through the Skype deal, because his firm bought a portion of the company, instead of letting it IPO, which would have brought more money for eBay.    Icahn is also demanding that PayPal be spun-off from eBay.  eBay is calling his accusations against Andreessen and others "blatantly false." Here's the full letter: Carl Icahn doesn’t let the truth get in the way of a good story. And while his letters and media interviews may be entertaining, they are not factually accurate. In fact, Mr. Icahn seems to be deliberately disseminating claims that are dead wrong. The claims against Mr. Cook and Mr. Andreessen, in particular, are blatantly false. We challenge Mr. Icahn to end his own charade with our shareholders. Let’s focus on honest, accurate debate. Here are the facts: FREE AppDownload
