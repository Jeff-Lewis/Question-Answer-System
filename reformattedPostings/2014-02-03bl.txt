Today's ISM manufacturing report was almost unbelievably disappointing. The headline index dropped to 51.3 in January from 56.5 in December. Economists were expecting 56.0. Many of the companies surveyed by the ISM blamed poor weather. But why were economists so far off with their estimates? For one thing, many of these economists model their numbers off of the regional surveys. This brings us to this colorful chart from Bloomberg LP chief economist Michael McDonough. It's of the progression of the national and various regional manufacturing survey indexes. McDonough notes that the ISM index — the national index — is the closest to breakeven. This is in contrast to the regional surveys, which are much farther away.   @M_McDonough Sure, the methodologies and samples for these surveys may vary. Still, it's weird to see the parts (the colored lines) doing better than the whole (the black line). "It's hard to believe that weather was the whole or even most of the story, but it's not clear what else triggered the suddenly much slower growth these results point to," said Morgan Stanley's Ted Wiesman. "Domestic demand growth saw some moderation late last year, but that followed very strong growth through most of the second half, and the report didn't indicate respondents were seeing a worse outlook for domestic activity. EM strains are certainly a risk for the export-oriented manufacturing sector, but the export orders index hasn't weakened too much so far. It fell from a multi-year high of 59.5 in November to 55.0 in December and 54.5 in January, so some slowing in export growth is indicated, but that's still well above last year's low of 51.0 in May or a run of sub- 50 readings during the global trade weakening in 2012. We'll see in coming months if Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the survey for ISM, ends up being right in predicting that the January ISM results would end up just being a "blip." FREE AppDownload
