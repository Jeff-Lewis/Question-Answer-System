The New York Fed just published its latest Quarterly Report On Household Debt And Credit. "In Q1 2013 total household indebtedness fell to $11.23 trillion; 1.0% lower than the previous quarter and considerably below the peak of $12.68 trillion in Q3 2008," said the New York Fed in a statement. This suggests the deleveraging process that has been slamming the economy may not be over. On the plus side, more Americans are staying current on their obligations. "[D]elinquency rates for each form of household debt declined, with about 8.1% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, compared with 8.6% the previous quarter," they add.
