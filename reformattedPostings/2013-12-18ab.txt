When Business Insider asked Stovall for his best chart of the year, he submitted this pattern that basically predicted this year's huge returns. It comes from a March 25 presentation that his team gave to clients. It illustrates the annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 during years when it closed positively during the first two months of the year. On average, the S&amp;P gains 24%. So far this year, it's up 27%. That's a breath-takingly small margin of error. "As always, remember history is a guide, but never gospel," says Stovall. Check it out. Business Insider FREE AppDownload
