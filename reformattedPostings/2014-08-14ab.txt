REUTERS/Mike Segar David EinhornDavid Einhorn trimmed his stake in Apple, bringing his total holdings in the iPhone maker to about 9.4 million shares on a split-adjusted basis, according to his latest 13F filing with the SEC.  In June, Apple executed a 7-for-1 stock split, and Einhorn's holdings in the company are worth about $878 million.  Einhorn also added substantially to his holding in Sunedison, adding more than 9 million shares to bring his take to above 21 million shares worth more than $480 million.  A 13F requires hedge funds to disclose their long positions within 45 days after a quarter ends, and so Thursday's filing represents Einhorn's holdings as of June 30. Einhorn also initiated new stakes in AerCap holdings and the recently-public Time Inc., which houses the print assets formerly bundled under Time Warner.  Among the stakes Einhorn reduced were his holdings in Anadarko Petroleum, which he sold down by 50% leaving him with a stake of 1.1 million shares worth $122 million. Einhorn also pared his holdings in Micron Technology, selling 3.6 million shares worth, though he still holds more than 40 million shares worth $1.3 billion in the semiconductor manufacturer.  Einhorn also sold out of his stake in Nokia and Rite Aid.  (Update: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated at Greenlight added to its stake in Apple.)
