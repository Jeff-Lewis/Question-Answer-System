Claims climbed to 336,000 from 323,000 a week ago. This was a tad higher than the 330,000 expected by economists. Despite the uptick, the level of claims still remain at pre-recession levels. The 4-week moving average was 330,500, down from last week's average of 332,750. This is the lowest level since November 2007. Markets are doing little in the wake of the report. Dow futures are up by 48 points. FREE AppDownload
