"India and the United States have resolved their differences on public stockholding of food," Nirmala Sithamaran said. "This opens the way for implementation of the WTO trade facilitation deal." The proposals will be reviewed by the World Trade Organization's General Council, she added, expressing the hope that approval would clear the way for India to sign a protocol enabling implementation of the trade accord.
