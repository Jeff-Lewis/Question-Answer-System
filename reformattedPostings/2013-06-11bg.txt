Wikimedia CommonsQuick heads up: The market is open and it's not pretty. The Dow is off 151. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are both off about 1.2%. This comes amid some serious weakness in Europe (Italy off 2.4%). Emerging markets are getting hammered. Japan fell 1.5% after no more action from the Bank of Japan. In general, ugly day on pretty much every front. For a good background on the factors driving the market lower, see Mohamed El-Erian on the sucking sounds that are getting louder and louder.
