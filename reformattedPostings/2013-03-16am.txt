The big news today is that to bailout Cyprus, the country will impose a 10 percent tax on people with over 100K EUR in Cypriot bank accounts. Those with less than 100K will pay less of a tax. Banks are closed until Tuesday (there's a holiday on Monday) but people are already lining up at ATMs, trying to take money out.

Many rushed to cooperative banks which are open Saturdays in Cyprus after learning that the terms of a bailout deal that the cash-strapped country hammered out with international lenders includes a one-time levy on bank deposits. The move, decided in an extraordinary meeting of the finance ministers of the 17-nation eurozone in the early hours Saturday, is a major departure from established policies. Analysts have warned that making depositors take a hit threatens to undermine investors' confidence in other weaker eurozone economies and might possibly lead to bank runs.
