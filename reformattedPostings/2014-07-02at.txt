REUTERS/Brendan McDermidSince 2010, a group of women have been suing Goldman Sachs for discrimination during their time as employees there. A complaint filed by Cristina Chen-Oster, Shana Orlich, and Lisa Parisi back in 2010 alleges that their male peers were paid up to 100% more than they were, experienced sexual harassment, and were forced to perform menial tasks like making photo copies and answering phone calls. On Tuesday, they filed with the Court to turn their case into a class action suit. “This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not change the case’s lack of merit," said David Wells, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs. It doesn't mean Goldman did anything wrong necessarily, it just means that, if U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres decides to grant class certification, any women who worked at Goldman during the statute of limitations of the case and feel they experienced this same treatment could jump in and make this very complicated for Goldman. Last year, the Court forced the bank to cough up all of its gender-bias complaints from female employees. A source close to the situation told Business Insider that Goldman plans to vigorously defend its position in the coming weeks, challenging the plaintiffs on their allegations that the bank's promotion, pay and performance review practices favor men. Here's what kind of behavior the Court will be looking for in order to grant class-action certification: Pretty heavy stuff. If the Judge allows this case to become a class action, there could be stories like these spilling all over the place. That's the last thing Goldman wants.
