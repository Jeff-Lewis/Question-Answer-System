WTI crude oil futures are getting slammed in today's session. Right now, they're down over 2.2 percent, and a big part of the drop came in just the last 20 minutes. Metals like gold, silver, palladium, copper, aluminum, etc. are all tanking today as well. Bloomberg's Moming Zhou reports: West Texas Intermediate tumbled more than $2 a barrel following declines in metals on rumors that a commodity fund is liquidating. WTI dropped as much as 2.8 percent as silver and platinum tumbled. Oil also decreased as gasoline futures slid for a second day from the highest level since September. “There is a rumor that a fund is blowing up,” said Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “Metals are getting hit and it’s spreading over to oil.” Below is a chart showing the move in oil, including the spike in volume in the light blue bars below the price graph: Thinkorswim And here is a chart of silver, which is off more than 3 percent today: Thinkorswim FREE AppDownload
