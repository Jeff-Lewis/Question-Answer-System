ShutterstockThe Ivy League may claim to be cracking down on fraternity and sorority hazing, but the practice appears to be alive and well on Columbia University's campus. Bwog, the online version of Columbia's monthly undergrad magazine, claims to have obtained a copy of one fraternity's scavenger hunt, which a tipster supposedly found in a printer. The frat in question wasn't dumb enough to include its name on the print-out, but New York Magazine points to Pi Kappa Alpha as the culprit. The scavenger hunt includes some silly tasks (Picture in front of Mei Dick barber shop: 5 pts) and some that are totally awful: Piss on Church of Scientology (minimum 1 picture): 15 pts Panties from XXL girl: 5 pts Video of motor-boating a girl: 10 pts Think it all sounds like harmless fun? Scavenger hunts are considered hazing on college campuses. The Fraternal Information Programming Group (via StopHazing.org) defines hazing as: Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol; paddling in any form; creation of excessive fatigue; physical and psychological shocks; quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste; engaging in public stunts and buffoonery; morally degrading or humiliating games and activities; and any other activities which are not consistent with fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution."
