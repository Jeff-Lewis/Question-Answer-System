Gold is getting smoked this morning and its fall has added to the already bearish Aussie dollar outlook as global investors and traders re-rate the prospects of the economy, interest rates and dollar.

So maybe, just maybe, the Aussie will find some support down here. BI Australia This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
