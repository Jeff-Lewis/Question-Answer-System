Markit's Purchasing Managers Index measures American manufacturing activity. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion; below, contraction. Output ticked upward to 53.9 from 52.7, the greatest increase since March, though weaker than Q1 figures. Here's the comment from Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson: The U.S. manufacturing sector appears to have remained stuck in a low gear in June, rounding off the weakest quarter since the third quarter of last year. With the average PMI reading down to 52.2 (compared to 54.9 in the first three months of the year), slower growth in the goods-producing sector looks likely to have acted as a drag on the wider economy, pulling GDP growth down from the annualised rate of 2.4% seen in the first quarter.
