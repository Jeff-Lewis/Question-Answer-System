The number was largely driven by sales of goods, with catering sales staying flat. Economists attribute the jump in retail sales to the "amazing online sales on China’s Singles’ Day (11 November) – the equivalent of Cyber Monday in the US," writes Wei Yao Societe Generale. Bank of America's Ting Lu also points out that retail stores also offered strong discounts at the time to compete with online retailers.  Chinese consumers spent a record $5.7 billion in sales at Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company. This compares with $1.9 billion that American consumers spent online during Black Friday. Here's a quick breakdown of retail sales: Yao thinks that if this was driven by a one-off event, then December retail sales should return to the trend growth of 13.3% YoY, seen before November.
