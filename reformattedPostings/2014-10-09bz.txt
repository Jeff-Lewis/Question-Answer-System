Bill Gross just wrapped up his first webcast since joining Janus, where he will manage the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund. Gross talked about how the last couple weeks have certainly been rough, both for PIMCO and Janus investors, and said he looks forward to focusing on investing and not dealing with some of the executive responsibilities he had at PIMCO.  On investing, Gross said he sees a slow-growth mode for the global economy, and said that this will reduce returns across all asset classes going forward. Gross also said that he looks forward to enjoying the flexibility provided by managing less money. This was Gross' first webcast since leaving PIMCO, the firm he founded in 1971, in late September, and follows his interview with Barron's over the weekend.  Following the webcast, Gross also released his first investment letter since joining Janus.    FREE AppDownload
