Oxford Said Business SchoolActivist investor Bill Ackman said that on Tuesday he would give "the most important presentation" of his career. "You're going to learn why Herbalife is going to collapse. And that's a pretty strong statement. But this is the largest fraud – public fraud in terms of scale, of countries involved, harm to people," he said on CNBC's "Halftime Report." Ackman has been short Herbalife — a maker of health shakes — since late 2012. Since that time, Ackman has waged a constant campaign against the company, arguing that it's an illegal pyramid scheme. Now he's claiming that he's ready to deliver a final deathblow against the company. Ackman will be unveiling an investigation into Herbalife's nutrition clubs. He says he has hundreds of hours of video, audio, and internal documents to support his claims.  "This will be the most important presentation that I have made in my career. So how's that for raising expectations? But we won't disappoint."  The presentation will be at 9:15 a.m. EDT.  He added that Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson, and his team are invited to the event.  "I want to make it very clear that Michael Johnson and his senior management team are welcome to come to the presentation. We'll be happy to sit them in the front row if they would like. We're happy to let them answer questions or even ask questions during the presentation," Ackman said. We'll be covering it live.
