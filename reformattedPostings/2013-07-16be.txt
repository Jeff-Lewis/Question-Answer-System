Tesla is now down 14%. Earlier today it was down 8.5% to $116. The stock has surged ever since the company reported its first quarterly profit back in May. Today's sell-off comes after a note by Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs who wrote that in the worst case the stock would be worth $58. In the mid-case scenario he sees the stock at $84, and in the bull case scenario he sees a stock price of $113. In the mid-case scenario, Archambault expects Tesla will sell 150,000 units and an operating margin of 14.8%. Goldman Sachs has a price target of $84 which they arrive at by taking an average of all three scenarios. They also have a neutral rating on the stock. Here's a look at how the stock is doing today.
