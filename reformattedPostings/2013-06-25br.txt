REUTERSThe Richmond Federal Reserve manufacturing index is out and it looks strong. The headline index jumped to +8 from last month's reading of -2. Economists expected the number to improve to just +2. From the Richmond Fed: Manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region advanced moderately in June after contracting at a less pronounced rate in May, according to the Richmond Fed’s latest survey. All broad indicators — shipments, new orders and employment — landed in positive territory. Most other indicators showed similar notable improvement. District contacts reported that backlogs were down but just barely, whereas capital utilization improved from May readings. The gauge for delivery times was little changed and finished goods inventories continued to grow, though at a slightly slower rate. Looking forward, assessments of business prospects for the next six months were generally in line with last month's expectations. Contacts anticipated continued growth in shipments, new orders, and capacity utilization in the months ahead while they anticipated backlogs would grow more slowly. Survey participants indicated that both raw materials and finished goods prices grew at a somewhat quicker rate than a month ago. Respondents expected raw materials to grow at a somewhat quicker pace in the next six months than they had anticipated last month, while they expected finished goods prices to grow at a slightly slower rate than last month's outlook. These regional Fed index offer great anecdotal information about what's going on in local economies. "Philadelphia Fed and Markit manufacturing surveys improved in June, suggesting, on balance, some slight expansion in factory activity," noted UBS's Sam Coffin. "The NY Fed survey was weaker. Although the headline current activity index rose sharply, details of the survey were weak and on an ISM- equivalent basis fell further into contractionary territory." FREE AppDownload
