YahooCiti's chief commodities analyst Ed Morse says oil prices have peaked for the year. In a taped segment with Yahoo finance today, he also reiterates his call that the "peak oil" theory is dead.

WTI currently sits at $104.64, while Brent is about $107. Brent is up about $7 since mid-June but has subsided in recent days as Middle East unrest subsided.  WTI has surged about $10 over the past few weeks, and Morse explained why.

So our prices have gone up; world prices have been steady or are actually going down.
