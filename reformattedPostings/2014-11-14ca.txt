REUTERS/Andrew WinningEurozone growth came in higher than expected, at 0.2% for Q3, and inflation came in at 0.4%, bang on what was expected by analysts.

French GDP beat expectations, rising 0.3%, the fastest of the three (which says a lot).  Italian GDP dropped another 0.1%, keeping the country in recession. According to the Guardian's Graeme Wearden, Italy has now had stagnant or falling GDP for 13 quarters. FREE AppDownload
