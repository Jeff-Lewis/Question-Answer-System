Germany released retail sales data for the month of December this morning, and the numbers came in much worse than expected. Sales fell 1.7 percent in December from the previous month. Economists were expecting a smaller loss of 0.1 percent after sales expanded 0.6 percent in November. Year-over-year, December retail sales were down 4.7 percent – well below the 1.5 percent decline predicted by economists and last month's -0.6 percent figure. Deutsche Bank economists Oliver Rakau and Stefan Schneider suggest that the recent uptick in consumer confidence could see these retail sales figures revised up: Destatis, European Commission, Gfk, DB Research The Deutsche Bank economists write, "The same happened recently with sales in October which were revised from an initial -2.8% mom to currently -0.9%."
