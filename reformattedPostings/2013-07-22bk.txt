REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiExisting home sales fell 1.2% month-over-month to an annualized rate of 5.08 million units. Economists polled by Bloomberg were looking for a 1.5% month-over-month rise to an annualized rate of 5.26 million units.  May's number was revised down to reflect a 3.4% rise to 5.14 million units. This is down from a previous reading of 4.2% rise to 5.18 million in May. Housing inventory ticked higher rose 1.9% to 2.19 million, which represents a 5.2-month supply. This is up from 5 months' supply. Tight supply of housing had previously weighed on existing home sales. The median time on market for all homes was 37 days in June. This is down from 41 days in May, and is 47% faster a year ago. The national median existing-home price was up for the sixteenth straight month, rising 13.5% year-over-year to $214,200. Decline in sales &amp; rise in inventory shows supply of existing homes is the loosest they've been this year, in keeping with slowdown in home price gains, according to Paul Diggle at Capital Economics. Here's a look at the regional breakdown: Economists have worried about the impact of rising mortgage rates on home sales. But Bank of America's Michelle Meyer points out that that existing home sales track closed contracts and "are indicative of market conditions one to two months prior, which was before the spike in interest rates." Meanwhile, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR said affordability continues to be  favorable. "However, higher mortgage interest rates will bite into high-cost regions of California, Hawaii and the New York City metro area market." Existing home sales account for a larger share of the market than new homes. FREE AppDownload
