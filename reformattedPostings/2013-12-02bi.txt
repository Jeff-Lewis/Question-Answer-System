Spain grew 0.1% in the third quarter, emerging from a two-year-long recession. But the country still has an impossibly high unemployment rate of 26%. Earlier this year, the European Court of Justice ruled against Spain's eviction laws that make it hard for homeowners to oppose an eviction by a bank. Soaring unemployment and a housing bust has seen a surge in evictions as borrowers are unable to pay their mortgages. Over 350,000 families have reportedly been evicted since the housing bust. Reuters photographer Susana Vera documented the eviction of Carmen Carmona and her family. Carmona was in a social rent flat — a place in which a homeowner who has defaulted on mortgages in the past can stay in the homes for a social rent of 30% of their salary.
