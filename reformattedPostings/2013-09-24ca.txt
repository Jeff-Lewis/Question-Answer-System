REUTERS/Mike BlakeFrom Calculated Risk, here's a quick look at the data that's coming out today. The housing-related data at 9 AM should be particularly interesting. • 9:00 AM ET, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for July. Although this is the July report, it is really a 3 month average for closings in May, June and July. The consensus is for a 12.4% year-over-year increase in the Composite 20 index (NSA).  • Also at 9:00 AM, the FHFA House Price Index for July 2013. The consensus is for a 0.7% increase.  • 10:00 AM, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index for September. The consensus is for the index to decrease to 80.0 from 81.5. • Also at 10:00 AM, the Richmond Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity for September. The consensus is for a reading of 10.5 for this survey, down from 14 in August (Above zero is expansion). We'll be covering them all, LIVE. FREE AppDownload
