BofA Merrill Lynch just released the results of its July Fund Manager Survey, which polls 238 fundies around the world responsible for a combined $643 billion in assets under management on various topics. One of the most striking results of the survey is how investor perceptions toward China can completely turn on a dime. "China is the biggest area of concern for investors," says BAML Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. "[The] number of investors expecting stronger China growth collapsed to a net -65%, a massive reversal from 67% in December 2012." All it takes is two quarters of slowing economic growth, and sentiment among fund managers toward China is now at the lowest level since January 2009, during the height of the global financial crisis.

The percentage of survey respondents that view China as the biggest tail risk nearly doubled just from June to July. "Investors continue to view a China hard landing and commodity collapse (56%) as the biggest tail risk," says Hartnett. "In fact, they view [emerging markets] as the greatest potential threat to Financial Market Stability." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Research FREE AppDownload
