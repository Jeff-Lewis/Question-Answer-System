REUTERS/Adrees LatifJob openings grew to 4.67 million in June, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, or JOLTS report, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Expectations were for the report to show 4.6 million job openings as of the end of June, down slightly from the 4.635 million openings that existed at the end of May. The June report showed that the hires rate was up 0.1% to 3.5% in June, while the separations rate was unchanged at 3.3%.  The quits rate was unchanged at 1.8% in June. Commentary from Bloomberg's Chris Middleton following the report indicated that there are about 2 unemployed job seekers for each available job in the economy.  The JOLTS report is one of Janet Yellen's preferred economic indicators, and will be watched closely ahead of next week's Jackson Hole symposium, which is being held under the title "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics."
