YouTube/SodaStreamSodaStream spokesperson Scarlett Johansson. "We are very disappointed in our recent performance," CEO Daniel Birnbaum said. Management said revenue unexpectedly dropped to $125 million from $144 million a year ago; this was far below analysts' expectation for $154.4 million. Operating earnings were $8.5 million, which compares with analysts' expectations for $17.6 million. "Our US business underperformed due to lower than expected demand for our soda makers and flavors which was the primary driver of the overall shortfall in the third quarter," Birnbaum said. "While we were successful over the last few years in establishing a solid base of repeat users in the US, we have not succeeded in attracting new consumers to our home carbonation system at the rate we believe should be achieved.
