Screenshot/Harrison JacobsProcter &amp; Gamble Co is getting ready to release a new Gillette razor in the battle for men's faces. Their newest innovation, according to marketing documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal, is a swiveling-ball hinge that allows the blade to pivot. The new ProGlide Flexball is aimed at the high-end market, with the company looking to charge a premium for a complex razor that can supposedly cut hairs 23 microns shorter and miss 20% fewer hairs. The new razor will come in manual and battery-powered versions for $11.49 and $12.59, respectively.  Kyle Stock at Bloomberg Businessweek explains why the new razor is so important.  "Gillette’s new razor will use P&amp;G’s current blades, a total departure from the notorious razors-and-blades model that has characterized the segment since Civil War beards went out of style the first time," Stock writes.  The new product could boost razor sales.  In January, P&amp;G revealed that razors weren't selling as well because of a secular decline in facial shaving.  Gillette plans to ship the razor June 9.
