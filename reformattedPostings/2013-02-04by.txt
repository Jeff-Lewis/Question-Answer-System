WikipediWall Street has often been referred to as a casino, but one bank actually owns a Las Vegas casino. Deutsche Bank's portfolio includes the $3.9 billion Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, which the bank finished building after the developer defaulted on their loans. During Super Bowl weekend, everyone from Wall Street to Main Street flocked to Sin City to engage in the sports betting scene and celebrate the biggest football game of the year. And this gorgeous casino Deutsche bank owns looks like an awesome place to do just that. (Corey Deshon shared his photos with us.)
