REUTERS/Richard ClementPending home sales missed expectations falling 1.3% month-over-month in July. This was worse than expectations for pending home sales to stay flat. On the year pending home sales to were up 8.6%, better than expectations for a 7.9% rise. This compares with a 0.4% month-over-month decline, and a 9.1% YoY rise in June. "The modest decline in sales is not yet concerning, and contract activity remains elevated, with the South and Midwest showing no measurable slowdown," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. "However, higher mortgage interest rates and rising home prices are impacting monthly contract activity in the high-cost regions of the Northeast and the West." Here's a look at the regional breakdown: Of course this isn't the only disappointing data we've seen. There's been a string os such data.  New home sales plunged 13.4% in July to an annualized pace of 394,000 units. Meanwhile, S&amp;P Case-Shiller home prices slowed to 12.07% YoY in July, compared with 12.2% in May. Housing starts missed expectations as well coming in at annualized rate of 896,00 units in July. Economists have been watching for the impact of higher mortgage rates on pending home sales activity and other housing data. The 30-year mortgage rate hit a new two-year high of 4.58% in the week ending August 22. Investors watch this number because it is considered a leading indicator of the housing market.
