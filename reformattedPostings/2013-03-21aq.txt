The figure was revealed after a judge ordered the terms of the settlement unsealed Wednesday. The AP reports Stephanie and Chris Hallowich also agreed there was no medical evidence that drilling harmed their health or their children's health, and that they'd received royalty payments from Range.  The Post-Gazette and the Washington Observer-Reporter had filed suit to have the settlement opened, although Reed Ward only obtained a summary of it.   In a 2010 National Geographic story by Marianne Lavelle, the Hallowiches said they'd "[suffered] burning eyes, sore throats and other symptoms when gas was released several times" after drilling equipment malfunctioned. Range's wells also disturbed their property, Lavelle reported:  “It’s ruined our lives. That’s what it comes down to,”  Chris Hallowich told Lavelle. “It’s ruined our plans that we had for the kids. It’s ruined what we thought was our perfect ten acres.” The family initiated a case against Range Resources, MarkWest Energy Partners and Williams Gas/Laurel Mountain Midstream Partners on May 27, 2010, according to the Post-Gazette. The dispute was settled by the parties in July 2011.   Range has 30 days to appeal the judge's decision to unseal the settlement. But the company issued a statement yesterday saying they "do not have concerns" and "greatly respect" the decision, according to Reed Ward.
