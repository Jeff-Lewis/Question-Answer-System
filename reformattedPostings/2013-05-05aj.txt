There's been an incredible collapse in the last month of the pro-austerity movement. The U.K. has been rebuked by IMF officials. Reinhart and Rogoff have imploded publicly. Niall Ferguson stuck his foot in his mouth equating Keynes' economic philosophy with his sexual orientation. Bill Gross has blasted the U.K. The new Italian Prime Minister has said austerity is over.
