"We still expect a last minute deal to avoid a U.S. default, but this will most likely be a temporary solution. A short-term deal to raise the debt-ceiling by 4-6 weeks could pass soon and will provide markets with some relief. However, as long as part of the U.S. government remains closed, the economy will increasingly feel the pain. A temporary agreement that also includes the continuing resolution would be a positive surprise. But even in this case, the time that such a deal would buy could be wasted without a permanent solution. Although markets remain calm for now, as indeed our latest flow analysis suggests, we are getting increasingly concerned about a tipping point where markets lose confidence. It may take such a moment for the U.S. politicians to reach an agreement, but the damage to the real economy could be notable."—BofA Merrill Lynch strategists Ralf Preusser and Athanasios Vamvakidis FREE AppDownload
