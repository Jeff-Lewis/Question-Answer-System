Two big reports that will gauge the health of the labor market come out today. From Calculated Risk: • At 8:15 AM, The ADP Employment Report for December will be released. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 150,000 payroll jobs added in December. This is the third report using the new methodology, and the report last month (118,000) was somewhat close to the BLS report for private employment (the BLS reported 147,000 private sector jobs added in November). • At 8:30 AM, the initial weekly unemployment claims report will be released. The consensus is for claims to increase to 363 thousand from 350 thousand last week. On Friday we get the Non-Farm Payrolls report (the jobs report) and perhaps most surprisingly, there seems to be zero interested in it, publicly, perhaps due to the end of the election, the focus on the Fiscal Cliff, and the fact that the economy seems to be on a more stable footing.
