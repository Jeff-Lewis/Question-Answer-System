Patrick Hoesly on FlickrMarkets around the world are in the red today. U.S. markets were down over 0.9% earlier today, but have since recovered some of those losses in the wake of a string of good economic news.  The S&amp;P is now down just 0.3%. However, Europe is still near its lows of the day. England's FTSE is down 2.1%. France's CAC 40 is down 2.5%. Germany's DAX is down 2.7%. Spain's IBEX is down 1.9%. Italy's FTSE MIB is down 2.8%. This follows sell-offs across Asia. Japan's Nikkei fell by a stunning 7.3%. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the Fed could start tapering its quantitative easing (QE) program during one of its next few FOMC meetings depending on economic data. QE is one of the Fed's economic stimulus programs, which is intended to lower interest rates through bond purchases. Over in China, the Flash Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly plunged to 49.6 from 50.4 a month ago.  A reading below 50 represents contraction, and this is the first sub-50 reading in seven months. Eurozone, German, and French Flash PMI numbers all showed improvement in May, however, all of the numbers continued to be under 50. FREE AppDownload
