He will be replaced by current President Robin Hayes, who has been at JetBlue since 2008.  Prior to that, Hayes spent almost two decades at British Airways. In recent months, reports had emerged of Barger being out of step with trends in the airline industry.  Fortune's Cyrus Sanati wrote that JetBlue's investors considered Barger to "overly concerned" with passenger comfort. Following its founding in 1998 by David Neeleman (who moved on in 2008 and started an airline, Azul, in his native Brazil), JetBlue established itself as a sort of low-cost boutique alternative to the major carriers, providing passengers with comfortable leather seats and individual TV monitors.  As Sanati noted, however, competitors such as Spirit Airlines have boosted investor returns in recent years by cutting back on types of perks that were JetBlue's calling card. Nonetheless, JetBlue's stock is up almost 50% this year. In June, the airline introduced Mint, a first-class option on flights between New York's JFK and Los Angeles' LAX, going counter to its longtime one-class-only ticketing. Expanded first- and business-class service has become increasingly attractive to airlines as they seek to earn higher profits. In after hours trading on Thursday, Jet Blue's stock was up 5%. Here's JetBlue's official statement about Barger's departure: NEW YORK, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 09/18/14 -- JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) today announced that Robin Hayes, the company's current President, will succeed Dave Barger as Chief Executive Officer, effective February 16, 2015.
