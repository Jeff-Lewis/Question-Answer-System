Gold has erased 5 percent of its value today. It just took another big leg down after getting hit several times this morning and trading sideways for most of the afternoon. However, it's just come into some renewed selling pressure late in the day, and is now trading around $1487 (it started the day around $1560). Technically, gold is now in a bear market thanks to today's massive decline. ThinkorswimClick to enlarge FREE AppDownload
