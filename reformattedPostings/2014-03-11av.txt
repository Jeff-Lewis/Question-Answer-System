After Seagram billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr. passed away, the family listed his penthouse at 960 Fifth Avenue for $65 million in February, The Wall Street Journal reported.  But it wasn't until recently that Brown Harris Stevens, the firm handling the sale, released interior photos of the 16-room property, according to Curbed NY. Bronfman, who sold his family's spirits empire for $34 billion in 2000, had lived in the prewar co-op for the past 40 years. The full-floor residence has five bedrooms, eight and a half baths, a library and a wrap-around terrace.    The official listing comes on the heels of Bronfman's younger brother Charles selling his own Fifth Avenue apartment a few blocks south.
