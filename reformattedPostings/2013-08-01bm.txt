Warren Buffett dropped in on the New York premiere of Breaking Bad's final season last night, walking the red carpet and posing for photos with actor Aaron Paul. Buffett told a Buzzfeed reporter that it's his "number one show, by far." "Not only is the story compelling — it’s a really an interesting story — but the acting is superb," he told BuzzFeed. And the 82-year-old billionaire even binge-watches the series on Netflix, just like you. This isn't the first time Buffett has hung out with Paul and his co-star Bryan Cranston. Earlier this year, he filmed a sketch with the duo that was used at the yearly Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting.
