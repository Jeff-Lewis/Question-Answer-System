In announcing a new budget today, George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister), said the U.K. needs a new £1 coin "to help reduce counterfeiting and ensure the integrity of the United Kingdom’s currency." Here are some details on the prototype from the Royal Mint: "The proposed £1 coin design is distinctly British, with a twelve-sided shape which evokes memories of the pre-decimalization threepence piece. "It will be constructed from two different colored metals and contain an iSIS security feature — a revolutionary new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint." There will be a public design competition for the reverse side of the coin, which the U.K. hopes to introduce in 2017. So shiny:  FREE AppDownload
