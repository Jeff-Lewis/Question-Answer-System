JP Morgan's PR team is heading "back to the drawing board" after feeling Twitter's sweet trollish justice for six hilarious hours. Wednesday afternoon, JP Morgan's "Ask JPM" hashtag — which the bank thought would make for a good live Q&amp;A session — was hijacked by reporters, pundits, and the bank's many critics. "Do you like puppies? If you had a puppy, what would you name him? #AskJPM," joked Bloomberg's Matt Levine. "What's it like working with Mexican drug cartels? Do they tip? #AskJPM," asked Salon's David Dayen. "Who does #2 work for?! #AskJPM," wondered Twitter user Rob Bartenstein. Answer, JP Morgan: Tomorrow's Q&amp;A is cancelled. Bad Idea.
