The police told Reuters that there were fatalities but did not say how many. Bloomberg reports that Brazilian Socialist Party presidential candidate Eduardo Campos died and that his aides say they lost contact with his plane. Seven people were on the plane, the Associated Press reports. Local media had reported earlier that Campos' wife and son were also on the plane, but that appears to be unconfirmed. In addition to Campos, two pilots, a campaign photographer, and a press advisor were also on the plane. Campos was 49 years old. He was third in the polls, according to Bloomberg. The election is set for October. Campos' plane reportedly lost contact with air traffic control as it was preparing to land, according to Reuters citing an Air Force statement. The Associated Press reports that the plane was trying to land in bad weather.
