"The Wolf of Wall Street" may not have used special effects to the same scale as, say, "Life of Pi" or "The Hunger Games," but the Martin Scorsese-directed, Oscar nominated film subtly used VFX to add that extra pizzazz to Jordan Belfort's colorful life. Brainstorm Digital recently released a video showing the before-and-after "of the more challenging shots we put together" from the film, so we broke it down below. Remember that wild party scene in the Hamptons where Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, first met his future second wife? Here's what it looked like in the final cut of the film audiences saw in theaters:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" But here's what the house and surroundings looked like originally:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" Special effects were used to replace the trees and parking lot...Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" ... with a neighborhood of houses:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" So that it ended up looking like this from afar:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" Then there's this scene in which a real lion parades through the office:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" No people were actually in the room at the same time as the lion, who was escorted on a leash by a trained professional during filming:BrainstormDigital/Vimo/"Wolf of Wall Street" The people were placed in the shot in the editing room, and the lion trainer removed:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" In the film, Jordan Belfort marries his second wife Naomi on a beautiful tropical island:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" But here's what the property actually looked like during filming:Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" The wedding set-up was later cut out...Vimeo/Brainstorm Digital/"Wolf of Wall Street" ...
