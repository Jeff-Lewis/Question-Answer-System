Please see my previous post New Highs in the Dow Part I – Indifference and Inevitability The Dow is going to 36,000. “What?” you say. “How could you make that prediction?  How could you embrace the kind of crazy-headline-grabbing assertion that made fools of earlier market prognosticators?  How dare you!”[1] “You’re just shilling like all those other stock market bulls!” Now wait a minute.  How dare I? Ok.  You want to play games?  You want to play rough? Say hello to my little friend, “Compound Interest.” [2] Remember the formula to convert today’s present value (PV) into tomorrow’s future value (FV), through an assumed annual return (Y) and a number of compounding years (N)? FV = PV * (1+Y)N If the Dow is roughly 14,000 today, it’s only a matter of time and an assumed annual return before we hit Dow 36,000.  Or 21,000.  Or 57,000. I mean, seriously folks.  Plug in an annual return and a time horizon, and I’ll tell you when we’re hitting that Dow target. 6% annual return, 14 years? Boom!  Dow 21,000! 2% annual return, 6 years?  Boom! Dow 15,700! 12% annual return, 17 years?  Boom! Dow 96,000![3] I mean, ultimately, who knows, and who cares? But here’s what I do know:   Please see my previous post,  New Highs in the Dow Part I – Indifference and Inevitability And my next post New Highs in the Dow Part III – What should I do? [1] Like these poor fools with their 1999 best seller: Dow 36,000: The New Strategy For Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.  And no, I haven’t read it and probably won’t, as again, it came out in 1999.  Which made them look foolish.  And yet also perhaps wise, as long as they allowed for a long enough time horizon. [2] You’re supposed to imagine me saying all this with Al Pacino’s Cuban accent in Scarface. [3] Admittedly, this last scenario isn’t likely.  But if we get 10% annual inflation, a 12% return on stocks seems reasonable.  And yes the returns will be largely nominal, with a huge reduction in purchasing power.  But, hey!  96,000 Baby! [4] Of course we should be empirical skeptics, cognizant of black swans in any particular scenario.  Species-ending meteors do impact the Earth, periodically.  So allocate 5% of your portfolio to Taleb’s Universa or whatever.  But with 95% of your long-term investment capital, just try to do the simple, boring, thing.  Trust me and embrace the sophistication that exists beyond complexity. [5] In the short run (&lt; 3 years), and possibly the medium run (5-10 years) risk-less assets beat stocks – occasionally.  Not in the long run.
