A new report from CoreLogic shows that the shadow inventory of homes fell 12.3 percent in October from a year ago.  Also known as pending supply, shadow inventory represents the houses that are intended for sale but aren't yet on the market. There are 2.3 million units in the shadows, which represent a seven month supply. “The size of the shadow inventory continues to shrink from peak levels in terms of numbers of units and the dollars they represent,” said Anand Nallathambi, president and CEO of CoreLogic. “We expect a gradual and progressive contraction in the shadow inventory in 2013 as investors continue to snap up foreclosed and REO properties and the broader recovery in housing market fundamentals takes hold.” Here are some key points from the report.
