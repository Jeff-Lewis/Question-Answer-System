People who attend Comic Con events in cities around the country dress as their favorite television, film, comic, video game costumes, and more. It's not just students dressing up and going to the Con.  We asked costumed attendees at New York's Comic Con last year what they did for a living. NYCC was filled with martial arts teachers, artists, accountants, and one guy who couldn't tell us what he did.
