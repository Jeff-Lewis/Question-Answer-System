Melia Robinson/BIJulian Marchese. Julian Marchese was 9 years old when he made his first trade. In high school, he skipped class on Fed Days. When the Canadian finance wunderkind was just a teenager, he developed a quantitative, long-short equity strategy that runs on an automated basis on his computer. Investing his parents' money, he saw returns that would make any amateur day trader jealous. Now a freshman student at NYU's Stern School of Business, Marchese and a partner at Yale are trying to launch a hedge fund out of their dorm rooms. Somehow, Marchese makes juggling school work with a social life and fledgling career as a hedge fund manager look attainable by anyone.
