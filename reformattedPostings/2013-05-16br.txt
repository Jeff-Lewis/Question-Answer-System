Today we get more evidence that growth is sputtering. Initial jobless claims jumped from 328,000 to 360,000, a number that was far worse than the 330,000 that economists were expecting. Housing starts missed big, in part thanks to a huge drop in multi-family. The total sequential drop was 16.5%. And then finally we got a soft CPI report, which is a double-edge sword. It's good in that drops in food and gas prices are great for consumers, and are indeed one of the big economic tailwinds.

The dollar is weakening on this news. FREE AppDownload
