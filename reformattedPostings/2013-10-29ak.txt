REUTERS/Jason ReedAt least as we know it. Tyler Cowen on how it ends (read the whole thing): – The exchanges will be mostly working by March 2014, but by then the risk pool will be dysfunctional.  In the meantime, real net prices will creep up, if only through implicit rationing and restrictions on provider networks.  The Obama administration will attempt to address this problem — unsuccessfully — through additional regulation. – By October 2014, no one will think the exchanges are a satisfactory solution, except for 17 state exchanges which will be running reasonably well.  Some of the state-level exchanges, by the way, will have more serious problems than is currently evident, mostly on the back end. – Chris Christie will campaign against ACA and beat Hillary Clinton in the general election.  Upon assuming office he will place price controls on the insurance plans in the individual market, repeal much but not all of the federal financial support for the Medicaid expansion, and keep many other parts of ACA, while claiming to have repealed the whole thing.  Enough Democrats will go along with this, as public opinion will have shifted toward the Republican side on this issue.  The individual market still won’t be working very well.  The exchanges will be working fine in the technical sense, but skittishness, political risk, and the adverse selection death spiral will have led the insurance companies to withhold high quality policies from that side of the market. An interesting scenario. So even a President Christie would initially keep the likely popular parts of Obamacare — such as community rating, guaranteed issue, adult kids staying on parents health plan, maybe even the premium subsidies. This hardly seems like a sustainable status quo. I urge Team Christie (or Team Rubio, or Team Cruz) to have a look at Seizing the ACA for other reform ideas and how think about healthcare reform from an innovation perspective. FREE AppDownload
