Google FinanceMarkets are falling early in the U.S. trading session. Earlier this morning, we learned that initial weekly jobless claims fell slightly from a week ago.  However, the level was still higher than what most economists were looking for. Still, markets are pretty close to an all-time high. The Dow closed at an all-time high of 14,164 on October 9, 2007. The S&amp;P 500 hit its all-time high of 1,565 on the same day.
