Gold prices are in meltdown mode today and gold stocks are also getting crushed. The precious metal fell below $1,300 an ounce, the lowest level in two years.  Let's do a quick scoreboard check of closely-followed billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, who has been long a bunch of gold stocks.      Here's a rundown of his gold stock holdings based on the most recent securities filing for the first quarter ended March 31.  Keep in mind, it is possible that he could have pared back some of his stakes in these stocks.    Based on our calculations, Paulson could have lost about $129,368,198 on these holdings so far today.  Paulson, who famously bet against the subprime housing market, has had a rough go of it during the last two years.  His big bet on gold has not come to fruition, yet.  Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Paulson's gold fund down 54%, according to an investor letter.   FREE AppDownload
