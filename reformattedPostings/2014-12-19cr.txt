REUTERS/Neil HallEuropean shares are climbing on most of the major indices after an extremely strong day for equities worldwide on Thursday. Here's the scorecard: France's CAC 40: +0.73% Germany's DAX: +0.51% UK's FTSE 100: +0.70% Spain's IBEX: +0.45% Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.30% Asian markets closed up too. Japan's Nikkei ended up 2.39%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.25% and China's Shanghai Composite ended 1.67% higher.  US futures are nudging higher too: The Dow is up 74 points and the S&amp;P 500 is 7.25 points higher.  There's no major data out today, but UK public finances at 9:30 a.m. GMT will offer a signal of whether the Treasury can reach its borrowing targets this fiscal year. To manage that, borrowing needs to fall by 25% over the next five months in comparison to the same period last year, according to Lloyds.  FREE AppDownload
