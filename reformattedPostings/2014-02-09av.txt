REUTERS/Laszlo BaloghTeam USA women's ice hockey coach Katey Stone talks to her team during a practice session in the Shayba Arena ahead of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics February 7, 2014.Building a successful Winter Olympics team is expensive. It takes top athletes, training, and equipment that tends to be pricier than in the Summer Games. "The Winter Olympics are a useful backdrop for case studies on the relationship between athletic performance and economic progress in emerging markets around the world," writes ConvergEx's Nick Colas. "We’ve analyzed the medal count by country since the inaugural Winter Games in 1924, and indeed the results show that athletes rarely make it to the podium until their respective countries experience economic progress and stability."   "Furthermore, consistent podium-worthy performances in subsequent years are typically correlated with GDP growth," he writes. Colas provides some case studies. From the note: Even the U.S.'s Olympic prowess is linked with the economy, Colas notes. "In the earlier years of the Winter Olympics, the United States lagged the likes of Finland and Norway in the medal count," he writes. "Later on in the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviet Union/Russia and Germany also topped the U.S. in trips to the podium.  And though the United States continued to improve throughout the latter half of the 20th century, it actually wasn’t until 2010 that American athletes won more medals than any other nationality."
