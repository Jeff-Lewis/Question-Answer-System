YouTube Everyone has been talking about the hedge fund war over Herbalife — a multi-level marketing firm that sells weight loss and nutrition products. One one side we have hedge fund titan Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, who is shorting the stock. After Ackman publicly declared his short, hedge fund heavyweight Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, took out a 8.24% stake in the company on the long side.  Some other fund managers have also gone long Herbalife after disagreeing with Ackman's short case. Ackman's rival Carl Icahn hasn't publicly said if he's long Herbalife or not, but he slammed him on Bloomberg TV for his "holier than thou" short calling him "disingenuous." It's definitely been a real-life clash of the titans. The most important thing you have to realize is that Herbalife itself is just the "McGuffin" in this story. It's a plot device that moves the story along, but in itself means very little. A classic McGuffin was the unidentified glowing item in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, which Marcellus Wallace was so eager to have returned to him. What was it? Nobody knew or cared. But a fabulous story hinged on it. So, if you're just coming into this story, we've put together a comprehensive guide of everything you need to know about the Herbalife hedge fund war:  We'll keep following this story as it develops.  SEE ALSO: The contract that started a huge feud between Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn &gt; FREE AppDownload
