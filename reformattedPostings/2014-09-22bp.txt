AP ImagesInside a clean room at Sigma-AldrichGerman pharmaceutical and chemical giant Merck announced today that it has agreed to buy Sigma-Aldrich, a US life sciences company for $17 billion. Merck will pay $140 per share in cash - a 37% premium to Friday closing price of $102.37. This type of transaction is not a first for Sigma-Aldrich. As the name suggests, it was formed when Sigma Chemical Company and Aldrich Chemical Company merged in 1975. The combined publicly-traded company has acquired at least six other biochemical and research companies since 2001. However, Sigma-Aldrich isn't exactly a household name outside of St. Louis, Missouri. In presentations given in May and June, Sigma-Aldrich detailed the scope of its operations and revenue.  FREE AppDownload
