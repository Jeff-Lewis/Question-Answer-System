REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThis week, the Federal Reserve will be holding its regular Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting where it will update the world on the direction of its ultra-easy monetary policy. This is without question the marquee event of the week, and the whole world will be watching. After the meeting, the Fed will release its FOMC statement which will be followed by its updated economic forecasts. And that will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Lately, investors have been speculating that the Fed could soon begin tightening its monetary policy, first by tapering its current bond-buying program. Some believe this is behind volatility in the markets where stocks have fallen, U.S. interest rates have rallied, and emerging market bonds have crumbled. Traders and investors around the world will watch the Fed very closely and scrutinize every breath for clues as to, if and when, the Fed is considering tightening monetary policy. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary There seems to be little consensus on what'll happen to stocks from now to the end of the year. But longer-term, the consensus seems to be that stocks will be heading up. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco recently said he expects the S&amp;P 500 to hit 2,000 by 2015. "Reduced recession risks and S&amp;P EPS grinding higher despite macro challenges has increased investor confidence in EPS sustainability and shifted the debate from normalized EPS to normalized long-term interest rates," he said. "Interest rates staying lower than history, even after the Fed stops purchases, as moderate growth persists making for an extended cycle, should drive the PE higher." In other words, all of this talk of tapering and tighter monetary policy may cause short-term volatility, but in the long-run it won't slam stocks. FREE AppDownload
