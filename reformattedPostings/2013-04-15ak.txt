In addition to providing a person finder to people impacted by the attacks at the Boston Marathon, Google helped compile a public spreadsheet of magnanimous Bostonians making their homes and living rooms open to stranded people.  It's quite a document, and one of several moving  actions by well-meaning people in the wake of the attack that left more than one hundred injured and at least two dead.  If you need a pick-me-up, check out the spreadsheet — which gathered more than 3,000 offers in less than two hours — to see how good people are handling the incident: Google FREE AppDownload
