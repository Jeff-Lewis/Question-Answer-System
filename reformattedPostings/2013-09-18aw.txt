Wikimedia CommonsThe Federal Reserve's FOMC statement is out, and it's a shocker! The Fed is NOT TAPERING its massive $85 billion large-scale asset purchase program. Almost no one expected this. The Dow went from -40 to +63 in the blink of an eye. And as Bernanke began the Q&amp;A of his press conference, the Dow surged +178 to an all-time high of 15,708! Also, the S&amp;P 500 is at 1,728, an all-time record high. The U.S. dollar tanked, and gold spiked. The 10-year Treasury note yield tanked to 2.76% from around 2.86% before the announcement.
