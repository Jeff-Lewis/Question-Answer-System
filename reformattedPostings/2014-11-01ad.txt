Gary Kaminsky Early mornings, high-powered meetings, and and peanut butter oatmeal, it's all par for the course in the life of Gary Kaminsky, Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of wealth management and former capital markets editor at CNBC. Kaminsky left CNBC for Morgan Stanley last year, joining the ranks of one of the hottest teams on The Street. It's an increasingly demanding business — wealth management has become one of finance's most profitable sectors — but Kaminsky remains energetic as ever, preparing for his sixth New York City Marathon and putting in those long hours with style.
