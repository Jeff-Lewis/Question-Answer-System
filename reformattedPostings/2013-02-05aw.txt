CorcoranInvestor Sagi Genger expected to have a big family, so not only did he buy a Park Avenue townhouse, but he and his wife also added a floor — making it 5 stories high (h/t WSJ). The 5200 square foot house has 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, a library, exercise room and three separate outdoor areas. The top floor is the master suite complete with private outdoor space, dressing room and entertainment center. Beth Benalloul of Corcoran has the listing.
