Weeks after a glitch at Goldman Sachs caused a bevy of erroneous options trade, the New York Federal Reserve has returned the favor to the firm. The Financial Times reports that a clerical error at the Fed left Goldman Sachs without any of the three-month Treasury bills it ordered at a government debt auction. According to the report, a computer bug at the New York Fed meant an actual human being had to manually record treasury orders. That Treasury official, the FT reports, gave Goldman more six-month bills than it had ordered but none of the three-month bills. From the FT: As a result of the over-allotment of the six-month bills, Goldman went over the 35 per cent Treasury limit that a bidder can acquire in an auction. The Treasury waived that rule while letting the results of the auction stand, and there will likely be no additional remedies for the bank, a person familiar with the matter said. Keep the change, Goldman! The Fed has had four glitch-free debt auctions since the incident. Read the full report at the FT » FREE AppDownload
