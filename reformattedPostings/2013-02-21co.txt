However, this may be one of the most closely followed Wal-Mart earnings announcements in a while. Last week, Bloomberg reported that emails exchanged by Wal-Mart executives suggested that February sales so far were a "total disaster."  Blaming the recent payroll tax hike, among other things, at least one exec reportedly wrote that this was the "worst start to a month I have seen in my ~7 years with the company." A spokesperson for Walmart told Bloomberg that the emails "lack the proper context." Hopefully, any discussion of outlook will provide some context. The earnings announcement is scheduled for release at 7:00 AM ET.  We'll be covering it live at BusinessInsider.com. FREE AppDownload
