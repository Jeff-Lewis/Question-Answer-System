DoubleLine FundsJeffrey Gundlach, the bond god of DoubleLine Funds, just wrapped up a presentation at the New York Yacht Club. The title: "Why Own Any Bonds At All?" Gundlach has long been correctly bullish on Treasuries.  And he reiterated his position that anyone predicting a bond market collapse is "dead wrong." Among other things, he's convinced that the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy easy for a very long time. "There's a better chance Bernanke buys every Treasury bond in existence before he ever sells a single one," quipped Gundlach according to Josh Brown. The presentation included must-see charts on the states of global debt, government finances, unemployment, and Japan. He also provided an update on some big trade recommendations including his call to buy natural gas and short Apple.
