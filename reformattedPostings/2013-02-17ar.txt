Steven Gresser / FlickrNational foreclosures fell 7 percent month-over-month in January and were down 28 percent on the year, according to RealtyTrac's latest foreclosure report.  This was in large part due to a California legislation called the California Homeowner Bill of Rights that came into effect on January 1. But large parts of the country continue to see a rise in foreclosure rate. We drew on RealtyTrac's latest foreclosure report to highlight the 17 metros with the highest foreclosure rate. Note: The metros are ranked by foreclosure rate i.e. 1in every X homes received a foreclosure filing. We picked the 17 metros with the highest foreclosure rate from all the metros measured by RealtyTrac. FREE AppDownload
