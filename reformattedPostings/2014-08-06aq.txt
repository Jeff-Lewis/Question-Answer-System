REUTERS/Jason Reed21st Century Fox reported fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.42 on revenue $8.42 billion.  Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 on revenue of $8 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.  In immediate reaction to the news, shares were up 1.6%. By segment, Fox reported cable network revenue of $3.35 billion, up from $2.95 billion a year ago, with TV revenue coming in at $1.03 billion and filmed entertainment revenue coming in at $2.8 billion.  Fox's filmed entertainment revenue grew 38% in the fourth quarter, with the company attributing this growth in part to the success of "X-Men: Days of Future Past," which has grossed $740 million to date.  In its TV segment, however, Fox's operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, fell to $145 million from $213 million the prior year, with the company saying that increased retransmission consent revenues were more than offset by lower advertising revenues. Ad revenues in the TV segment fell 11% from the prior year led by declines in "American Idol" ratings. Fox also reported its annual results, with revenues increasing 15% over the prior year to $31.87 billion. Fox's earnings announcement comes one day after the company said it had withdrawn its offer to acquire Time Warner. Concurrent with that announcement, the company also authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program, which it expects to complete in the next year.  On the company's earnings conference call, CEO Rupert Murdoch called the company's decision to walk away from the Time Warner deal its "resolute" decision.  FREE AppDownload
