Markets tanked in Europe yesterday after Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup Chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that Cyprus could be used as a template for future bank resolutions. Suddenly  markets got spooked. Wasn't Cyprus supposed to be a one off? Later in the day the Eurogroup had to put out a statement saying that Cyprus was unique. Anyway, Dijsselbloem made a funny excuse yesterday on Dutch TV. On Dutch TV last night: "Dijselbloem said he didn’t even know the English word “template” so he maintains he couldn’t have used it".
