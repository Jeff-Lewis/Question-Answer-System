International business travel is often a necessary part of remaining globally competitive, but paying for transportation, lodging, dining, and entertainment can be expensive for companies. Concur, a provider of travel and expense management solutions for businesses, recently released their "Expense IQ Report," which looks at the habits of business travelers. To determine how businesses are spending money on travel, Concur processed $50 billion in expense reports last year. Among other factors, it ranked the most expensive international cities for  business travelers, and Brisbane, Australia, ranked as the most expensive city for business travelers, with an average spending cost of $547.53 per person. Lodging in Brisbane alone costs an average of $305 per night.  Other Australian cities, including Sydney (#3), Perth (#4), and Melbourne (#7), also made the top 10 list.  London, which took the #5 spot with an average cost of $516, also ranked as the #1 most visited international city by business travelers, proving that cost is no deterrent for business travel.  The list only looked at international cities, but had it included U.S. Cities, New York would have ranked ninth on the list, with an average spending cost of $476.
