"Although the survey says 'long,' the outcome feels more like an absence of shorts rather than a statement of conviction for lower yields. One way to interpret last week’s survey results is that being short rates is a bit like a waiting taxi with a running meter. It’s costly, and if you’re unsure how long you’ll be waiting, you’re probably better off letting this cab go and flagging another one later. It is the same with interest rates right now, and we suspect market participants may be waiting a while before they’re ready to resume their journey to higher yields."—JPMorgan strategists Alex Roever and Kimberly Harano   FREE AppDownload
