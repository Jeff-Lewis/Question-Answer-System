Charles W. Cushman Photography Collection / Indiana University ArchivesAmateur photographer Charles W. Cushman traveled extensively in the U.S. and abroad capturing daily life from 1938 to 1969. His works have been donated to and maintained by Cushman's alma mater Indiana University, which has kindly given us permission to publish his gallery of New York City photos taken in 1941 and 1942. They give a great impression of what Chinatown, the Financial District, and Midtown looked like 70 years ago. FREE AppDownload
