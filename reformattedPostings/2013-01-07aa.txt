Business Insider"Political risk has entered our vocabulary," writes Ian Bremmer pointing to the fiscal cliff, the eurozone crisis, and the turmoil in the Middle East. Every year, Bremmer, the head of Eurasia Group, publishes a list of the top 10 risks the world faces.  He also includes a couple of red herrings of which we should be mindful. Believe it or not, Bremmer actually thinks that the world may be a little too worried about what's going on in geopolitics. "Looking to 2013, political risk in the developed world is now overstated," he writes. "Despite the chaos in Congress--which we'll surely see much more of in the coming year--concerns about the fiscal cliff in the United States have been overplayed. So too the fragmentation of the eurozone.  And the impact of continued zero growth in Japan." But this doesn't mean we should be dismissive of the risks. What follows are Bremmer's top 10 risks for 2013, key excerpts from his report, and a list of the red herrings. Follow the Eurasia Group on Twitter: @EurasiaGroup. FREE AppDownload
