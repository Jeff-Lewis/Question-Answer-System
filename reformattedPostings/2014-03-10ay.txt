We came across this adorable photo of Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charlie Gasparino that was taken when he was five years-old.  The future Wall Street reporter, who was rocking some black socks, already looked ready to hunt down a scoop. Then again, this picture was taken in Bronx, where Gasparino spent some of his childhood, so you have to have a little attitude. Enjoy!
