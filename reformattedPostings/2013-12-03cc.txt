Here's a great little Black Friday nugget. Wal-Mart's #1 seller was a washcloth. From NBCNews: The retailer announced it had sold 2.8 million towels during the shopping event, which this year started even earlier at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. The textile sales outpaced the 300,000 bicycles, 1.4 million tablets, and 2 million televisions sold during the period, and also beat last year's towel sales by 1 million. For $1.74, bath towels and six packs of washcloths were available. That breaks down to $.29 per washcloth. And there's video of people going nuts for the washcloth:  FREE AppDownload
