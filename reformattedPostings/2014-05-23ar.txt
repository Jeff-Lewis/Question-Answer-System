15 Central Park WestA duplex condominium at 15 Central Park West sold last week for $48 million, despite clearing about $15 million less than the original asking price, today’s property records show. The 5,610-square-foot apartment spanning the 18th and 19th floors at the Zeckendorfs’ luxury tower sold to an LLC represented by a Chicago law firm, according to records that became public today. The four-bedroom, seven-bath apartment featuring a park-facing terrace, staff room and internal elevator was listed for $62.5 million when it hit the market in October. Listing agent Kyle Blackmon of Brown Harris Stevens could not immediately be reached for comment. The sale marks the second-priciest in the 202-unit building to date, topped only by the $88 million sale of former Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill’s 6,744-square-foot home in 2012, which set a Manhattan residential record. Blackmon was the listing broker on that deal, as well as the $29 million sale of a 33rd-floor apartment in August. Seller the Ullman Family Partnership bought the apartment that hit public records today for $23.9 million in March 2008, according to city filings. FREE AppDownload
