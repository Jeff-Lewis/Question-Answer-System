andrijbulba via Compfight ccWhole Foods is down as much as 6% after hours, to $52.10. The retailer reported Q1 earnings of $0.42 per share, missing expectations for $0.44 per share. Q1 comp sales were up 5.4%, missing expectations for a 5.7% rise. The company also lowered guidance and now sees full-year EPS of $1.58-$1.65 per share, from $1.65-$.169 per share. This was also below expectations for $1.68 per share. It expects full-year comp sales up 5.5-6.2%, compared with expectations for 6.2% rise. This is lower than its prior outlook for 5.5-7%. The one positive from the earnings report was that the comps for the youngest stores were strong. "Comps for stores &lt;2 years old were +19.5%, the best since 2Q12. Comps for older stores continued to erode," writes Ken Goldman at JP Morgan. "The question we ask, though, is how poor investor sentiment was entering the print. If most investors were expecting comps below 5.4% -- and we think many were – then perhaps a small relief rally is in store tomorrow for the stock. But this is a tough one to call in terms of the stock reaction, and overall we have little doubt at this point that fundamentals are decelerating. We expect sell side numbers to drop tomorrow."
