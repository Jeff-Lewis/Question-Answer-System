Flickr/Eva the WeaverThe NASDAQ is falling again. It's already down over 1% in the early going. This comes on top of yesterday's big losses. In addition to the index losses, there are some big notable drops. AOL is down 18% after beating on revenue but missing on earnings. Twitter is down 3.5%. That stock got clobbered yesterday on the lockup expiration, and obviously the selling isn't over yet. Yahoo is down 5.6%. This is ominous since the world just got a look yesterday at the Alibaba S-1, which Yahoo owns a big part of. King, the maker of Candy Crush, is down nearly 10% after earnings this morning.. Whole Foods is down 21.5% after the company warned on weak same-store sales numbers, which was the result of bigger competition. So yeah, it's a really ugly day for some big names. Ominously, Yellen just came out and said that more accommodative policy wouldn't be warranted for awhile. That was no help. Tune in for details throughout the day. FREE AppDownload
