Wikimedia CommonsYesterday was a total bloodbath in the market. Today, markets are generally green. The difference: The People's Bank of China reportedly stepped in and eased the massive liquidity crunch in the Chinese banking market that was sending China's version of LIBOR (SHIBOR) higher.

Incidentally, Chinese stocks fell another 0.5%, hitting brand new lows. FREE AppDownload
