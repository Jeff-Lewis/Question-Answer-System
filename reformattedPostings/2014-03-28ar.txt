This video is sponsored by OppenheimerFunds.   The traditional ways of saving for retirement just aren't measuring up anymore. As people live longer, markets continue to underperform, and Social Security becomes uncertain — experts say it will become insolvent by 2035 — investors will have to be even more proactive if they want to secure their financial futures. OppenheimerFunds has created a video (that's also an infographic!) explaining why investors and advisers need to start a new conversation about growth, income, and protection against certain risks. Watch it (above) to find out more. Learn more at GrowthIncomeProtection.com. * Protection is positioned as an investment goal. Investing in certain securities may help to hedge against certain risks, but does not imply any guarantee from loss. Mutual funds are subject to market risk and volatility. Shares may gain or lose value. Oppenheimer funds are distributed by OppenheimerFunds Distributor, Inc. OppenheimerFunds Distributor, Inc. is not affiliated with Business Insider.
