The Japanese stock market is standing out as the ugliest market in the world right now. The Nikkei fell 2.1% in Wednesday trading. It's now tumbled significantly for three straight days, even as the other global markets have seen some stabilization. One factor weighing on Japan was a major Toyota recall affecting 6.4 million vehicles. The company says it is aware of no deaths associated with the mechanical issues. The stock dropped 3%. Other than tht, markets are mostly quiet. US futures are totally flat. German stocks and the UK are up a little bit. The big event in the US today will be the FOMC, which will shed more light on the first meeting under Janet Yellen.  FREE AppDownload
