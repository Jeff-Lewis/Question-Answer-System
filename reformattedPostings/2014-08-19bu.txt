Dead RabbitThe "Goin' Ballistic in the Financial District" cocktail competition at Dead Rabbit in May.Every year the New Orleans Culinary and Cultural Preservation Society holds a premier cocktail festival — called the "Tales of the Cocktail" — to determine the best bars, bartenders, and products in the business. It's basically a five-day schmooze-fest, "education event," and showcase for the brightest minds in the business, from bar owners to mixologists. So they know their stuff. This year they handed out awards for categories ranging from World's Best Drink Selection to Best American Hotel Bar.
