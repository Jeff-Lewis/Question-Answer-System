Parents in developed markets overwhelmingly believe their children will be worse off financially than they were, according to a recent chart from Citi.   France is the gloomiest by a wide margin, with 90% of adults saying their children will face greater hardships than they did. Israel and Australia were the least pessimistic. In the U.S., 62% said their children's fortunes will have deteriorated.   Fewer emerging market parents are as glum about their kids' future — though here the lowest "worse off" ratings are in places, like China and Russia, that barely made it out of the 20th century alive.   CIti FREE AppDownload
