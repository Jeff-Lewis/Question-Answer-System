APKentucky Senator Rand Paul went on a great rant during today's Senate subcommittee hearing on Apple's offshore tax practices, slamming his Congressional colleagues for even holding the hearing in the first place.  "Frankly, I'm offended by the tone and tenor of this hearing," Paul said, laying into those who take issue with Apple's tax policies.  "I'm offended by the spectacle of dragging in executives from an American company that is not doing anything illegal," he added. "If anyone should be on trial, it should be Congress."  Apple CEO Tim Cook is testifying before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations this morning to defend the company from accusations that it avoids tax payments by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries in Ireland.  Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, the chair of the subcommittee, said Monday that he has "never seen anything like" Apple's tax "gimmickry." Paul took issue with the premise of Tuesday's hearing, however, and called on the Senate to stop "harassing" Apple, which he called one of "America's greatest success stories." "Instead of doing the right thing, we drag businessmen and women in here to berate them for trying to maximize their profits for shareholders," Paul said. "Apple has done more to enrich people's lives than politicians will ever do."  Watch the video below:   FREE AppDownload
