The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the SEC has opened an inquiry in Herbalife. Following the news, Herbalife sold down sharply, more than $3 to hit a low of $36.28 after trading at $40.58. Since then, it has bounced to above $40 a share. Hedge fund titan Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, revealed last month that he has a massive short position in Herbalife -- a multi-level marketing company he says is a pyramid scheme.  Today, Dan Loeb, the founder of Third Point, disclosed a massive long position in Herbalife.  Third Point has 8,900,000 shares, or an 8.24% stake in the company.  Check out the chart: CQG FREE AppDownload
