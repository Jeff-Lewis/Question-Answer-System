REUTERS/Andreas ManolisWorkers queue to register for unemployment benefits.Jobless claims rose to 283,000 last week. Expectations were for claims to rise some from last week, to 281,000 from 264,000. Last week's number was the lowest reading for the indicator since the week of April 15, 2000.  That report was also revised up to 266,000. The four-week moving average of initial claims, however, fell further to 281,000 from 284,000 last week, the lowest level for this average since May 6, 2000. Thursday's report contained no special factors, according to the Department of Labor. In a note to clients following the report, Chris Rupkey at MUFG said, "Unemployment claims, the timeliest indicators as Bernanke once dubbed them rose 17K to 283K... If there are global risks, Europe is slowing, the commodity-cycle boom-bust cycle is looking more bust like by the day,  war and terrorism, if companies were concerned enough perhaps seeing a drop in sales that they actually started firing workers, it would show up here first in the weekly unemployment claims data. Well, it’s not happening. The labor market is still strong and any slack remaining is just a figment of the Federal Reserve’s imagination." FREE AppDownload
