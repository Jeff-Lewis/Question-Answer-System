Jobless claims missed, coming in at 326,000. Consensus was for an increase to 310,000, from a revised 298,000 prior. But, continuing claims fell to 2.653 million, beating expectations for 2.675 million and down from a revised 2.666 million. Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson says the broader trend continues to move in the right direction: This is superficially disappointing but the seasonal adjustment for last week's very low number was always a bit suspect. Taking the two weeks together, though, claims have averaged 314K, well below the pre-Easter trend. The eight-week moving average - our preferred measure of the trend - nudged up a touch but at 319.8K it has dropped significantly from 328.5K at the end of the first quarter, and 339.9K at the end of the fourth.
