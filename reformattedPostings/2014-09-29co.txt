Expectations were for personal income to rise 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.4% month-over-month. "Core" PCE, which excludes the cost of food and energy and is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month, better than expectations for "core" PCE to be flat.  On a year-over-year basis, "core" PCE rose 1.5%.  The report showed that private wages and salaries rose by $30.4 billion in August, more than the $17.4 billion increase in private wages and salaries in July, while supplements to wages and salaries rose $4.7 billion August against a $3.8 billion increase in July.  In a note to clients following Monday's report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Autos drive August spending up, but Q3 will look pedestrian... Assuming no revisions, that implies Q3 consumption will rise by only 1.6% annualized, down from 2.5% in Q2." Last month, personal spending unexpectedly declined 0.1%.  FREE AppDownload
