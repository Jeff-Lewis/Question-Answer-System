Calculated Risk has the preview: • At 9:00 AM ET, S&amp;P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for November. Although this is the November report, it is really a 3 month average of September, October and November. The consensus is for a 5.8% year-over-year increase in the Composite 20 index (NSA) for November. The Zillow forecast is for the Composite 20 to increase 5.3% year-over-year, and for prices to increase 0.4% month-to-month seasonally adjusted. FREE AppDownload
