Shares of Netflix are soaring in after-hours trading after the company released an earnings announcement that crushed analysts' expectations.   Netflix posted a profit of 13 cents earnings per share in the fourth-quarter.  Analysts were looking for a net loss of 13 cents. The stock was last up more than 24 percent in the after-hours session.  This is also a big win for billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  On November 19, 2012, Icahn Associates disclosed that owned 4,291,066 shares, or a 9.98 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "Carl Icahn became a 10 percent investor last quarter at approximately $58 per share.  We have no further news about his intentions, but have had constructive conversations with him about building a more valuable company," Netflix said in its 8K filing with the SEC.  FREE AppDownload
