Even after 2013's massive 30% rally, the stock market continues to grind higher. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average booked a record-high close. Meanwhile, market bears are convinced things could soon turn south. They argue that elevated stock market valuations (for example, high price earnings multiples) and record-high profit margins have increased the risk of a disorderly sell-off. Or perhaps even a crash. "People could be right that the market multiple will contract, but we doubt they can provide empirical evidence to support this claim," said Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker. "The part of the argument we really don’t like is the part where people say that the multiple expanded a lot last year, so that increases the odds of less or no multiple expansion or even contraction this year. That’s baloney." In a recent research note, Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg notes that stocks don't fall just because they've gone up a lot. "We go into fundamental bear markets either when the Fed overtightens, when the economy heads into recession, or both," he said. Rosenberg presented this chart showing 12-month returns in the S&amp;P 500 since 1969. As you can see, downturns typically coincide with recessions (shaded area). It's particularly interesting to see that 30%-plus rallies over 12-month periods — like what we saw last year — happen pretty regularly. Gluskin Sheff FREE AppDownload
