The month-over-month gain of 1.72% was also nicely ahead of expectations. "The 10- and 20-City Composites posted their highest monthly gains in the history of S&amp;P/Case- Shiller Home Price Indices," David M. Blitzer chairman of the S&amp;P index committee said in a press release. "Thirteen cities posted monthly increases of over two percentage points, with San Francisco leading at 4.9%.The earlier preview is below." Home prices are back to their 2004 levels. And both composites are down 26 - 27% from their June/July 2006 peaks. There was some concern that rising mortgage rates would hurt the housing recovery, but Blitzer said "home buyers have survived rising mortgage rates in the past, often by shifting from fixed rate to adjustable rate loans." Paul Diggle at Capital Economics expects the pace of home price growth to decline in coming months. Here's a chart of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index: S&P/Case-Shiller --------------------------------------- The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index for April is out at 9 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Bloomberg are looking for the 20-city Case Shiller to rise 10.6% year-over-year, and 1.2% MoM. The 20-city index was up 1.1% on the month, and 10.9% on the year in March. While home prices have shown double digit growth in recent months, the pace of home price growth is expected to slow in coming months. A bottom in housing inventory, the return of sellers, the inability of investors to find bargains, and rising mortgage rates are all expected to take the steam out of rising home prices.
