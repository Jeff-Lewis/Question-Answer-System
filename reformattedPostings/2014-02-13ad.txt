Unfortunately, forward revenues isn't as upbeat. It’s been falling over the past year in the UK. Furthermore, the UK's forward profit margin has declined sharply over the past three years, which has depressed forward earnings over that period. That might explain why the forward P/E is relatively low at 12.5, which is a 7% discount to the world.

The only good news is that the forward profit margin seems to have bottomed early last year and is recovering slowly. With the forward P/E at 12.9, the region is selling at a 4% discount to the world.
