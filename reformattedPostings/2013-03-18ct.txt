On Saturday morning, Cyprus and the EU announced a plan to tax depositors' bank accounts at 6.5 percent up to 100K eur and 9.9 percent over that.

But the outcry has been so loud, that the country is busily working to revise the schedule. The incomparable Matina Stevis has the current planned tax schedule, which is being discussed today.
