That's in addition to the 34,000 jobs it officially confirmed in December.  So we're now talking 45,000 to 50,000 jobs cut. HP CEO Meg Whitman told analysts on the quarterly conference call that these cuts will come from all business units, and in all geogrpaphies. Analysts asked a lot of questions about this revised layoff plan, noting how HP keeps increasing the layoff targets. One even pressed Whitman to promise that this was the final number.  She replied, "I don't anticipate an additional program after this." Whitman insisted that it wasn't a lack of confidence in HP's ability to grow revenue that is causing the bigger layoff. She just keeps seeing more areas where HP needs to trim. "The longer I’m here, the more opportunties we see. We think that’s a goodness," she said. By trimming the workforce, she feels HP becomes "easier" to work with, while reducing its costs. CFO Cathie Lesjak told analysts that these cuts will save HP about another $1 billion, in addition to the $3 - $4 billion HP expected to save by cutting 34,000 jobs. Here's what HP said in its press release: In May 2012, HP adopted a multi-year restructuring plan designed to simplify business processes, accelerate innovation, lower costs and deliver better results. HP previously estimated that 34,000 positions would be eliminated in connection with the plan. As HP continues to reengineer the workforce to be more competitive and meet its objectives, the previously estimated number of eliminated positions will increase by between 11,000 to 16,000. To recap: in December, it officially increased the layoff by 5,000 jobs above the 29,000 jobs it had previously announced. (It had already warned it might shed more than 29,000 jobs. But in December, it made that number official).  And that was an increase from the 27,000 jobs it announced in May 2012, as first reported by Business Insider. In October, 2013, HP CEO Meg Whitman also said that the company would not do another big layoff once this round was over. She promised, "After 2014, we are not going to do another big restructuring." This layoff, whatever its final number, is supposed to be completed by October 2014, the end of HP's fiscal 2014 year, HP said when it first announced the job cuts in 2012. HP says it currently has 331,000 employees. FREE AppDownload
