 Today’s strong market rally seems to us to be based on false hope and wishful thinking.  After years of sharp disagreement, it appears highly improbable that a deal can be worked out under the pressure of six-week timeframe.  If anything, the two parties seem further apart than they were a year ago when neither the budget super committee nor various congressional working groups were able to hammer out an agreement.  The result was the sequester that still continues to put a damper on economic growth.  The stock market and the economy, therefore, will probably continue to be under pressure for some time to come.
