The Fed Model actually worked quite well in the late 1990s. It showed that the S&amp;P 500 was 21% overvalued during the week of July 4, 1997. It was then undervalued by 16% during the week of October 9, 1998 as a result of the meltdown of LTCM. It didn’t take long after that for the market to be overvalued by a record 69% during the week of January 14, 2000. Greenspan got his answer. The bubble burst, and so did the usefulness of the Fed Model. Since the start of the previous decade, the Fed Model has signaled that stocks were cheap relative to bonds. They got much cheaper during the last bear market from October 2007 through March 2009. Currently, the model shows that stocks are 63% undervalued relative to bonds. Or is it that bonds are overvalued relative to stocks because the Fed is keeping yields artificially low with its ultra-easy monetary policies?
