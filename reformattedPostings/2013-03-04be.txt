In 2012, the U.S. exported a $2.2 trillion worth of goods.  According to a new report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is an all-time high. This is also a huge improvement from 2011 when the U.S. exported $1.5 trillion worth of goods. Exports grew in 35 U.S. states, with 29 states setting new records for export sales, said the report. "Nationally, jobs supported by exports increased to 9.8 million in 2012," added the Commerce Department. So, anyone who says America doesn't make anything anymore is wrong. So who's buying all this stuff? Sales grew the most in countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. According to the report: Nationwide, 2012 U.S. merchandise exports to countries with which the United States has a trade agreement outpaced other markets nearly two to one. This included exports to: Oman (+22 percent); Panama (+20 percent); Costa Rica (+19 percent); Chile (+18 percent); Jordan (+18 percent); Colombia (+14 percent); Australia (+13 percent); Peru (+12 percent) and Mexico (+9 percent).
