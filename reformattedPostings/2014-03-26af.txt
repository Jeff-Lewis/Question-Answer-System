You get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS. The person probably uses a very common surname, making it harder to identify who he or she actually is. The caller knows the last four digits of your Social Security Number, and your caller ID will probably read as an IRS toll-free number. You even hear a call center in the background. The caller will threaten you with jail time and the loss of your driver's license before hanging up on you. You'll then get a call from the local police department, or the DMV, again citing numbers squaring with that claim. Unsurprisingly, the caller will demand that you pay immediately with a pre-loaded debit card that is, more or less, untraceable. It's a scam, and it mostly targets recent immigrants and people with a prior history of owing the IRS. So be careful when you answer the phone: the IRS reports that this is the biggest year for phone scams yet. All told, the scam described above has snared 20,000 taxpayers already to the tune of $1 million... and it's not even April. J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for the Tax Administration is calling it "the largest scam of its kind that we've ever seen." If you get a call from the IRS and you know or suspect that you owe taxes, call the agency at 800-829-1040. The IRS has among some of the best trained customer service people out there. If you have no reason to suspect that you owe, call the Federal Trade Commission immediately at 800-366-4484. FREE AppDownload
