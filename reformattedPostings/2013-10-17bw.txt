(NYSE: GS) today reported net revenues of $6.72 billion and net earnings of $1.52 billion for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013.

Highlights “The third quarter’s results reflected a period of slow client activity,” said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Still, we saw various signs that our clients are prepared to act on significant transactions and we believe that the firm is well positioned to help our clients accomplish their objectives. As longer term U.S. budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a more sustained recovery.” Net Revenues Investment Banking Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.17 billion, essentially unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2012 and 25% lower than the second quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $423 million, 17% lower than the third quarter of 2012, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm’s Underwriting business were $743 million, 13% higher than the third quarter of 2012. This increase reflected significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily due to higher net revenues from initial public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2012. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013. (7) Institutional Client Services Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $2.86 billion, 32% lower than the third quarter of 2012 and 34% lower than the second quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.25 billion, 44% lower than the third quarter of 2012, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and interest rate products, as well as in currencies. In addition, net revenues in credit products were lower, while net revenues in commodities were higher compared with the third quarter of 2012. During the third quarter of 2013, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment, which was characterized by economic uncertainty, difficult market-making conditions in certain businesses and lower levels of activity. Net revenues in Equities were $1.62 billion, 18% lower than the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business (8). Net revenues in equities client execution (excluding net revenues from the firm’s Americas reinsurance business) and commissions and fees were both essentially unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2012. In addition, securities services net revenues were lower compared with the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to the sale of the firm’s hedge fund administration business in 2012. Although global equity prices increased during the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by lower levels of activity and volatility. The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm’s own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $72 million ($47 million and $25 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the third quarter of 2013, compared with a net loss of $370 million ($225 million and $145 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the third quarter of 2012. Investing &amp; Lending Net revenues in Investing &amp; Lending were $1.48 billion for the third quarter of 2013. Results for the third quarter of 2013 included net gains of $938 million from investments in equities, primarily in private equities, driven by strong corporate performance and company-specific events. In addition, Investing &amp; Lending net revenues included net interest income and net gains of $300 million from debt securities and loans, and other net revenues of $237 million related to the firm’s consolidated investments. Investment Management Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.22 billion, 2% higher than the third quarter of 2012 and 9% lower than the second quarter of 2013. The increase in net revenues compared with the third quarter of 2012 reflected higher management and other fees, primarily due to higher average assets under supervision and favorable changes in the mix of assets under supervision, partially offset by lower transaction revenues. During the quarter, total assets under supervision (3) increased $36 billion to $991 billion. Long-term assets under supervision (3)increased $35 billion, reflecting market appreciation of $19 billion, primarily in equity assets, and net inflows of $16 billion, primarily in fixed income assets. In addition, liquidity products (3) increased $1 billion. Expenses Operating expenses were $4.56 billion, 25% lower than the third quarter of 2012 and 24% lower than the second quarter of 2013. Compensation and Benefits The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $2.38 billion for the third quarter of 2013, 35% lower than the third quarter of 2012. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first nine months of 2013 was 41.0%, compared with 43.0% for the first six months of 2013 and 44.0% for the first nine months of 2012. Total staff (9) increased 3% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013. Non-Compensation Expenses Non-compensation expenses were $2.17 billion, 9% lower than the third quarter of 2012 and 4% lower than the second quarter of 2013. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2012 included a decline in insurance reserves, reflecting the sale of the firm’s Americas reinsurance business, and lower depreciation and amortization expense, primarily reflecting lower expenses related to consolidated investments. These decreases were partially offset by increased net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. The third quarter of 2013 included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $142 million. Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2013 was 30.3%, essentially unchanged compared with 30.4% for the first half of 2013. Capital As of September 30, 2013, total capital was $245.70 billion, consisting of $77.62 billion in total shareholders’ equity (common shareholders’ equity of $70.42 billion and preferred stock of $7.20 billion) and $168.08 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $153.58 and tangible book value per common share (10) was $143.86, both approximately 2% higher compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 458.5 million as of September 30, 2013. During the quarter, the firm repurchased 10.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $161.59, for a total cost of $1.65 billion.

The warrant agreement required net share settlement and the firm delivered 13.1 million shares of common stock to Berkshire Hathaway on October 4, 2013. The impact to both the firm’s book value per common share and tangible book value per common share was a reduction of approximately 3% in October. Under the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies, the firm’s Tier 1 capital ratio (6) was 16.3% (5) and the firm’s Tier 1 common ratio (6) was 14.2% (5) as of September 30, 2013, up from 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively, as of June 30, 2013 (in each case under Basel 1 and reflecting the revised market risk regulatory capital requirements which became effective on January 1, 2013).
