Morgan Stanley is out with its latest retail "Atlas" which shows the breakdown of various retailers by geography. Here's the one for Starbucks: Morgan Stanley As you can see, Starbucks are absolutely everywhere. California has 2468. The state with the fewest is Vermont, which just has four. To really get something out of the map, you should compare it to this "heat map" which shows the average retailer's breakdown by region. Morgan Stanley You can see that Starbucks is overrepresented in the Northwest, as 6% of its locations are in the region, compared to just 3% for the average retailer. That's not surprising, given that Starbucks was started in Seattle. On the flipside, Starbucks is drastically under-represented in the Southeast (11% of its locations are in the region vs. 24% for the average retailer). Again, this is not all that surprising as the Southeast not a region you'd normally associate with yuppie coffee culture.   FREE AppDownload
