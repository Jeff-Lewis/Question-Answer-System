This gave Americans time to think about the economy, which has been showing signs of slowing in Q2, and the stock market, which is just off of its all-time high. Last week saw the stock market's first three-day losing streak of the year.  It's worth noting this streak started when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that the Fed could soon start to "taper" its quantitative easing (QE) program.
