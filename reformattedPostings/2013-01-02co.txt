BloombergSean West is the Eurasia Group analyst who nailed the Fiscal Cliff fight, putting 2-1 odds of there being a deal as late as December 31, when many people were concerned that it was all over. So we asked him for his take on the Debt Ceiling fight, which will be coming up in the next couple of months. As a refresher, a whole bunch of stuff is coming up over the next two months, as the debt ceiling, the sequester, and the end of the current budget are all happening around the same time. Suffice it to say, he is not as optimistic that things will go as smoothly, and that's saying something! The main difference: In the Fiscal Cliff fight, there was an alignment of incentives to get a deal. In the debt ceiling? Sharply different incentives. Here's what he told us via email: While Congress and the President averted the fiscal cliff, it provided little reason to believe the debt ceiling battle will be anything but another round of brinksmanship — and potentially an even nastier fight. On the fiscal cliff, everyone in Washington had a shared incentive to avoid an across the board tax increase and sequestration --and the pathway to a deal was still so ugly that most folks thought they would never get there. On the debt ceiling, incentives are not at all aligned. The President has an incentive to take the debt ceiling off the table for good as a Republican leverage point by refusing to negotiate on it; Republicans have an incentive to get the most out of Obama on spending cuts as possible while they have the leverage. It's too early to know exactly how it will shape up, but it's safe to say the cliff negotiation did not establish a new method of politics conducive to bipartisan deal making. Should be interesting!
