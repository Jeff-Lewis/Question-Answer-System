REUTERS/Eric ThayerThe NASDAQ MarketSite in New York's Times Square.Nasdaq appears to be having another tech issue. The exchange says that it has halted trading in its Nasdaq Options Market.  That options market will remain halted through today's close.   Here's a timeline of events from today courtesy of Nasdaq. From Nasdaq Trader:  14:06 ET: On Friday, November 1st at 10:36:57 a.m. ET, NASDAQ OMX halted trading on the NASDAQ Options Market (NOM), one of the exchange group’s three U.S. options markets. A significant increase in order entries inhibited the system’s ability to accept orders and disseminate quotes on a subset of symbols, which resulted in the NOM halt. As equities options trading continues on eleven other venues, including NASDAQ OMX PHLX and BX Options, NASDAQ OMX has determined it is in the best interest of market participants and investors to cancel all open orders on the NOM book at 10:36:57 a.m. ET, and to continue the market halt through the close.
