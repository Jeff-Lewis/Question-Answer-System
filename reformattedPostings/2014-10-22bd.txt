"Critical-thinking skills" are frequently listed in the requirements of job postings advertised by top companies, but it's a talent that is often hard to define. The Wall Street Journal reports that hiring managers at Goldman Sachs, recently ranked by LinkedIn as one of the world's 100 most in-demand employers, are looking for someone who is able to "make use of information that's available in their journey to arrive at a conclusion or decision." The investment bank's global head of recruiting Michael Desmarais tells The Journal that to determine whether a job candidate is in fact a critical thinker, the company likes to ask interviewees to evaluate a company's market valuation or a stock pitch. By explaining how applicants arrived at their conclusion about the worth of a company's stock, Desmarais says, the applicants reveal their critical-thinking processes. Goldman explains in a 2011 post on its company blog that it also likes to judge creativity and problem-solving in its prospective employees. It does this by asking brain-teasers like, "How many manhole covers there are in New York City?" and requiring interviewees to design a procedure for finding a solution. "This answer may or may not be correct, but the important thing is to demonstrate one's approach to problem-solving," the company writes.  FREE AppDownload
