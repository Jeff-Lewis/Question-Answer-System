ReutersWhile most hedge funds are struggling in 2014, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square is having a spectacular year. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ackman's $13.7 billion Pershing Square Capital is up 18.7% for the year through the end of April. To put that in perspective, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 1.6% year to date. According to HFR's HFRX Equity Hedge Index, the average equity hedge fund is down -0.31% year to date. Ackman is known for being a mostly long-only fund manager. The activist investor takes large positions in a handful of companies.  His portfolio includes Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Beam, Burger King, Canadian Pacific, Howard Hughes, General Growth, and Procter &amp; Gamble, his latest 13F filing shows. Ackman recently disclosed massive stakes in pharmaceutical companies Valeant and Allergan. He's partnered with Valeant to pursue a takeover of Allergan. This investment helped his fund rise 7.3% in April, the WSJ noted. Ackman is also notoriously short Herbalife, a multilevel marketing company that sells weight-loss shakes. He rarely shorts companies. Ackman believes Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" and that regulators will shut it down. The FTC and a number of attorneys general are investigating the company. He has yet to break even on that short bet. FREE AppDownload
