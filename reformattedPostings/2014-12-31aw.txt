RexThe next James Bond movie — "Spectre" — was announced back in December. The bad news is: the movie won't be out until the fall of 2015.  But the good news is: you can still get some Bond in your life while you wait. We've put together a style guide based on Daniel Craig's James Bond: edgier and darker, but still maintaining that smart-elegant vibe.  Whether you want to go full-on Bond, or just add an accessory or two, you'll find it here.   Sony Pictures Entertainment/Youtube You just couldn't have a Bond without a suit. Usually, he's sports a gray one, ranging from light to charcoal tones. We recommend erring on the darker side — not everyone can pull off a heather gray. For the shirt and tie — choose a light blue shirt and navy tie. They're warmer than white and black, respectively, but still convey a serious vibe. Investment: Burberry London grey slim-fit wool suit — $1,395 Deal: Salvatore Exte Men's two button charcoal gray suit — $449.00 $95.86 to $109.86  Investment: Brioni blue striped cotton shirt — £310 ($482) Deal: Bloomingdale's Houndstooth Check Dress Shirt — $449.00 $49.77  Investement: Turnbull &amp; Asser ribbed silk tie — £95 ($147) Deal: Calvin Klein men's silver spun solid tie — $65.00 $33.14     Omega For almost two decades Bond's been wearing the Omega "Seamaster watch," which you can get yourself as well. Or you can find yourself a better deal on a lookalike. Investment: The Omega "Seamaster" 300 Chrono Diver watch — $3,640 Deal: SO&amp;CO "Monticello" stainless steel watch — $325.00 $43.99     Sony Pictures Entertainment But sometimes, Bond is running around in a more casual look, typically rocking a leather jacket. (Which is pretty much the cool-guy staple.) We recommend combining 2014's biggest trend in menswear with the classic James Bond style staple by getting yourself a leather bomber jacket. It's pretty much a win-win. Investment: Schott slim-fit leather jacket — £775 £387.49 ($1206 $603) Deal: Navy A-1 Leather Flight Bomber Jacket — $299.99 $149.99  YoutubeArguably the best scene in Casino Royale is the whole poker sequence. Scratch that — there's no debate. If you ever find yourself invited to a black (or white tie) setting like this high-stakes poker game, you better have that real bow tie ready. Investment: Turnbull &amp; Asser Silk Bow Tie — £55 ($86) Deal: Silk Bow Tie — $15.99 $9.50   A Martini Glass YoutubeAnd of course, James Bond's martini. Have a couple of glasses on hand so that you, too, can prepare a strong cocktail. Especially if you'd like to impress a date. Investment: Luigi Bormioli martini glasses (set of 4) — $37.00 Deal: Libbey martini glasses (set of 4) — $39.99 $17.01  Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
