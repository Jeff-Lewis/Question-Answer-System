Entertaining and eating with clients is a big deal on Wall Street, and for the most part, no amount of money is too large for top notch food and top notch service. That said: Wall Street's favorite restaurants aren't always the most expensive, or even the top rated. In a great city like NYC, you can find excellent food basically anywhere — that means huge debates on what's really good and what really matters. And there's another element — being seen by people who really matter. Mix all that together and you can come up with a pretty solid list of Wall Street's most beloved restaurants. Only one, however, can be crowned Wall Street's favorite. Have your say in the survey below and we'll let you know which restaurant takes all.   FREE AppDownload
