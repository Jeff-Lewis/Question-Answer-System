Other markets are falling as well. US futures are modestly lower, while Italy is down by 0.75%, France is off by 0.75%, and Germany is lower by 0.73%. Shanghai remains closed for Holiday, but for a reflection of sentiment towards China (which came out with bad data over the weekend) the Aussie dollar continues to sink like a song, falling below 94 cents against the dollar.
