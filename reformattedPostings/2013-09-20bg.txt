en.wikipedia.org Do you work in finance? Are you tall, green-eyed and of above average intelligence? If so, you may want to donate your gametes. You would not be the first. Data from the London Sperm Bank (LSB) reveals that finance workers are some of the most prolific spreaders of their seed. On average, 36 finance professionals visit the bank every month. This puts them on a par with students, and compares to donations from just three chefs and six film makers. Only IT managers are more keen (45 a month, on average). Dr. Kamal Ahuja, managing director of the LSB says finance professionals are frequent visitors to the Bridge Centre near London’s Tower Bridge. Sperm donors aren’t paid in the UK, but the clinic offers £35 ($56) to cover any costs. Ahuja says a lot of the bankers who visit refuse the payment. “They want to donate and to make a gesture – like blood donors. Some of them have seen the effects of infertility and want to help.” Ahuja cites one particular investment banking donor who has made ten separate donations (the maximum allowed under British rules) and has consistently declined to be compensated. “Because of his personal wealth, he doesn’t care for the money. He has helped to create ten families.” This article originally appeared at eFinancial Careers.  Copyright 2013. FREE AppDownload
