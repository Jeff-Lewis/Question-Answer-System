Via Wikimedia CommonsIt's consumer confidence Friday. Preliminary results from the University of Michigan's July consumer confidence survey indicated that confidence dipped slightly in July, defying consensus expectations for an increase to new five-year highs. Against that backdrop, ConvergEx Group Chief Market Strategist Nick Colas highlights a few eye-opening statistics on bottled water consumption in the United States this morning. Perhaps the most incredible number: at an average cost of $1.22 per gallon, consumers are spending 300 times the cost of tap water to drink bottled water. In fact, that number could be even higher, writes Colas in a note to clients. "The [bottled water] industry grossed a total of $11.8 billion on those 9.7 billion gallons in 2012, making bottled water about $1.22/gallon nationwide and 300x the cost of a gallon of tap water," Colas says. "If we take into account the fact that almost 2/3 of all bottled water sales are single 16.9oz (500 mL) bottles, though, this cost is much, much higher: about $7.50 per gallon, according to the American Water Works Association. That’s almost 2,000x the cost of a gallon of tap water and twice the cost of a gallon of regular gasoline." A few more stats, via Colas: "What’s most remarkable about this data, though, is what it says about the American consumer: that despite the (debatably) excessively high cost of bottled water when compared to its tap equivalent, we continue to buy it – even during an economic downturn," writes Colas. "While Americans did cut back slightly on bottled water during the recession about -3% over the course of 2008-2009 consumption hit a new all-time high in 2012 and shows no sign of stopping."
