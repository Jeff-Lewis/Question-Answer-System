Reports have just broken that a 7.9 magnitude earthquake just occured off the cost of Costa Rica. In an eery coincidence, Art Cashin dedicated a huge chunk of his note this morning to increased earthquake activity. From Cashin's Comments (emphasis ours): Empty Plates – A few weeks back, I noted that a friend had come across a hypothesis that earthquake activity might pick-up on the short run.  The hypothesis was based on the fact that several planetary and solar angles were to occur almost simultaneously. That, in turn, was a twist on tidal theory.  Just as positions of the sun and moon influence, the slower more persistent angular relationships of sun and planets might put lingering pressure on some of the earth's tectonic plates – thus increasing the potential for earthquakes and even volcanoes. While I don't actually have an Acme Seismograph at home, with the help of Wonder Woman, I have monitored and reviewed seismic activity since the call.  There have been a couple of whoppers, luckily not in heavily populated areas, but overall, the number of quakes at 6 or over did not appear to increase materially. What did seem to increase (at least from a layman's perspective) were the number of solar storms.  A quick check indicted the original angle charts were heliocentric – as viewed from the sun's surface.  That would likely put the tidal pressure on the sun – thus solar storms. We'll check back with our pal to see if the original source of the theory intends to recalculate those influences (mass, distance, angle, etc.) for a more geocentric impact. Until he get backs to me, I'll just reread Copernicus. FREE AppDownload
