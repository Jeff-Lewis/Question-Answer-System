REUTERS/Lukas BarthPeople gather around a bonfire and watch the 2014 World Cup match between Germany and Ghana on an outdoor film projector, during the Sonnwendfeuer (Midsummer) Festival at Mt. Kampenwand in Bavarian Alps, Aschau, June 21, 2014.Lately, everything seems pretty great. Summer has begun, the World Cup is on, stocks are at all-time highs, and market volatility is at a historic low. Investors seem unfazed by turmoil in Iraq and rising oil prices. However, we can't ignore the fact that inflation is becoming an increasingly problematic issue. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary Citi's Tobias Levkovich published his mid-year U.S. equity strategy report, which included his initial forecast for the S&amp;P 500 in 2015. From the report: "Higher profits compel a modest pickup to the 2014 S&amp;P 500 year-end objective and a mid-2015 target is being introduced. Given index appreciation thus far this year and better earnings, the 2014 year-end S&amp;P 500 target was just edged up to 2,000 from 1,975 while a more detailed analysis generated a mid-2015 objective within the 2,040-2,060 range (or a single point figure of 2,050). The bigger challenges facing investors in 2015 might involve a significant change from the Fed and Chinese economic trends. It is reasonable to wonder about a forthcoming tightening in monetary policy once tapering is completed and the focus shifts to rate hikes. The timing and intensity of such moves will be somewhat dependent on inflation pressures but there is also concern about the impact of any rate hikes on emerging economies."
