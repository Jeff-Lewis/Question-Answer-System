With the Dow hitting brand new all-time highs yesterday, there's a lot of discussion about what's next. We've already seen a long-term take from Jeremy Siegel, who argues that Dow 18,000 is reasonably likely by the end of next year. For a more short-term, trading-oriented look, here's some analysis from BTIG's Dan Greenhaus, writing in his "Bedtime With BTIG" note last night.  What matters for our clients though is not some numerical level (ignoring that the real price is ~10% below current levels) or an analysis of realized/unrealized gains but solely whether further gains lay ahead. On that front, the table below is a bit interesting. We took a look at previous instances in which new highs were made and what kind of performance immediately ensued. As you can see, it’s not always good and in fact, nearly two months later, equities are, on average, only barely higher, taken nearly nowhere. History doesn’t repeat but it does rhyme and after rallying 15% from November’s low, is a flat-to-down two months really so bad? We don’t think so.             					                                                                                                                                            facebook                                                                        linkedin                                                                        twitter                                                                        google+                                                                        email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                email                                                                                        share                                                                         share                                                                         tweet                                                                         share                                                                         email                                                                                        Share on Facebook                                                                         Share on Twitter                                                                         Share on Linkedin                                                                         Share on Google Plus                                                                         email                                                            Recommended For You                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];                                    _taboola.push({mode:'thumbs-1r', container:'taboola-below-main-column', placement:'below-main-column'});                                                                                                                        Comments             Comments on this post are now closed.
