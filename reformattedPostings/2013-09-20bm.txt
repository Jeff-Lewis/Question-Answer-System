St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard just hinted on BloombergTV that an October taper (reduction in the pace of bond purchases) is possible. From Dave Lutz at Stifel, Nicolaus: James Bullard, a  Centrist – is out speaking right now, saying that a October taper is possible – We are seeing Gold, Equities and Bonds getting hit – and the rhetoric today may intensify as we have 2 big hawks scheduled to speak today as well (Details in WTAW) - EEM, Gold, Bonds, equities not very happy right now.  Couple that with DC Rhetoric on Food Stamps and Debt votes - and the tape has a few headwinds to deal with. One interesting comment from Bullard is that if they want they can have a press conference after the October meeting, even though that's not scheduled. FREE AppDownload
