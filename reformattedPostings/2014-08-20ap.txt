Hewlett-Packard just reported its third-quarter earnings and we're sifting through them now. It hit $27.6 billion in revenue, a much-needed beat, and hit 89 cents earnings per share, that's right in line. Analysts were expecting 89 cents earnings per share on $27.01 billion in revenue. That's an increase over the 86 cents EPS reported last year. They were also expecting a small decline in revenue, which was $27.23 billion a year ago. When Whitman was new to the CEO job, she told investors to look for sales growth to happen in 2014, then told them growth wouldn't happen until 2015 or beyond. So this is a very good sign. Investors also wanted HP to confirm it will hit EPS of $3.72, and it did. It projects it will achieve $3.70 - $3.74 EPS. And they are looking for $1.05 EPS on $28.62 billion in sales next quarter. HP confirmed guidance of $1.03 - $1.07 for next quarter, too. But investors are not exactly tickled. Stock is down slightly, about 1%, in after-hours trading. Analysts expect HP to finish the year with on about $110 billion in sales for the year. That would mean ending the year almost flat on revenues, down just over 1% from 2013. Whitman has trimmed debt and expenses and increase profits, not including expenses from extraordinary items like HP's ever-expanding layoffs. Earlier this year, HP said it will cut another 11,000-16,000 people from its payroll, cutting a total of 45,000-50,000 people, instead of the 27,000 it originally targeted. It also bumped back the completion date of the layoff.
