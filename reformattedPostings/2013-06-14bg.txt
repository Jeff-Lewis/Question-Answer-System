Out on the golf course, I've overheard some of the game’s greatest myths. How about: ”Watch out, I just bought a set of clubs like the ones Tiger Woods uses.” Allow me to do some myth busting: Tiger doesn't actually show up to play — you still have to do that yourself. Or, “Hit it harder, son, it will go further.” Nope. If it did, all baseball players would be great golfers. Myths endure even though they fly in face of logic, yet people still believe them. The same pitfall plagues retirement planning. For many, it’s easier to believe in myths than to face reality. But it’s not good to stick your head in the sand, so let’s do some more myth busting there as well: You can’t rely on myths, not to improve your golf game and certainly not to improve your retirement outlook. But with planning and focus, you can be well on your way to achieving the retirement of your dreams.
