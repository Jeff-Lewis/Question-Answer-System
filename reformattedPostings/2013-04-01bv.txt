Flickr.com/I.GoussIn the spirit of April Fools' Day we are sharing some of the best trading floor pranks of all time.   "Every joke was invented down there," a retired NYSE specialist told Business Insider.   The thing is the trading humor has subsided in recent years. "Fortunately, or unfortunately, you don't see those pranks anymore," said another veteran trader.  He explained that in the past, traders played pranks on the floor to help everyone "blow off steam."   "You can't be running at 100 percent all the time," he said. "You need to break the tension and that's why on the floor, every floor, they'd have some sort of prank or joke." Veteran traders both in New York and Chicago from the NYSE, CBOT, NYMEX and AMEX told us about some of the classic pranks and jokes they used to pull back in the day.  * If you have another trading floor prank, joke or story you would like to share, please send Julia an email at jlaroche@businessinsider.com.   FREE AppDownload
