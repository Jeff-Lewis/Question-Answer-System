REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschNovember durable goods orders data are out. Total orders rose 3.5% in November, surpassing expectations for a 2.0% rise. October's 2.0% decline was revised down to a 0.7% loss. Orders of durable goods excluding transportation rose 1.2%, besting expectations for a 0.7% gain. The October rate of growth was revised up to 0.7% from -0.1%. Orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft (a.k.a. "core capex") surged 4.5%, well above the 0.7% consensus estimate. October's number was revised to -0.7% from -1.2%. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 2.8%, above the 1.0% consensus estimate, with October data revised down to -0.4% from -0.2%. "With the market seeking evidence of a broadening economy since business investments has been one of the main missing components, November durable goods data provided such evidence," says Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.
