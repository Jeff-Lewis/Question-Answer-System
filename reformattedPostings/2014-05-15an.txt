Wal-Mart's sales unexpectedly fell today.  But while overall foot traffic and sales were down, there was one bright spot—Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market concept.  Sales at the markets were up an impressive 5%.  Wal-Mart has about 400 Neighborhood Markets, compared with more than 3,300 Supercenters, notes Kyle Stock at Bloomberg Businessweek. The average store is about 20% the size of a Supercenter.  Big box stores are becoming irrelevant as Americans downsize and purchase big-ticket items like furniture and televisions online.  Wal-Mart's marketplace concept focuses heavily on fresh produce and groceries. While traditional Wal-Mart stores are situated on large patches of land, the Neighborhood Markets are primarily in urban areas.  Wal-Mart shared some photos of its new concept. Chances are, one will be coming to a neighborhood near you in the future.  Here's a Neighborhood Market in California.
