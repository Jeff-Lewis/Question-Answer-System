The MacallanThe last time The Macallan released a limited edition scotch whisky (sold only at its distillery in Speyside, Scotland) the line outside the door was long enough to disrupt the distillery's day to day activities. "The workers were both amused and a little annoyed because it made it difficult for them to get to work in the morning," said Craig Bridger, The Macallan's brand ambassador. It was alarming how quickly the release sold out.  This latest release, The Macallan Rare Cask, will only be sold in the United States, so Speyside's distillers are free to go about their business in peace. Lucky for them, and lucky for us. Instead, all the chaos will ensue around liquor stories down by Wall Street and up to Midtown. Here's why. What makes The Macallan Rare Cask so rare goes back to the casks The Macallan uses to age the whisky, Bridger explained. A team led by The Macallan's master distiller goes to Spain pick the sherry casks — made of oak, of course. That takes 24 months. Those casks are "seasoned" sherry for 18 months, are then dried and sent to Scotland.  "This is really an homage to our wood program," said Bridger. "We're one of a small handful of whisky producers, and certainly the biggest one, that doesn't use artificial coloring." That's right, he said "wood program." They even have a Master of Wood. His name is Stuart MacPherson, in case you were wondering. After the team finds 100 casks that are up to snuff, they fill them with some The Macallan's aging stock.  Only the whisky in casks that survive that test get bottled. Inside the bottle is a scotch that manages that starts out with a bold, spicy taste and leaves your tongue with a light citrus taste. Share this only if you must. FREE AppDownload
