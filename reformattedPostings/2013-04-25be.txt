Bloomberg made the relationship between Wall Street and Twitter official when it added a Twitter application to its ubiquitous terminal. Earlier this week, we saw how important Twitter is to markets too, when a false AP Tweet claiming the White House had been attacked and that President Obama was injured sent the market into a tailspin. And just as quickly as the market sold off, it stabilized when the truth was discovered. So our questions is: Are traders using Bloomberg's Twitter platform for those crazy rides? Or are they still getting their information from trader chats, or using other Twitter clients to keep track of what people are talking about? You tell us. FREE AppDownload
