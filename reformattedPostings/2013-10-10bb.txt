Henry Blodget / Business InsiderI've been working in and around the tech industry for about two decades, and I had never seen Apple's headquarters. I figured it was time to change that. So the other day, after taking an early flight to San Francisco, I drove down to Cupertino. I tweeted about this adventure as it unfolded, and lots of you asked for pictures. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't allow you to take pictures within the "mothership," as the global headquarters is known, but there's plenty to see on the outside. So here we go... (I'm not going to pretend I wasn't excited to visit Apple, by the way. I was. This was a pilgrimage to the heart of a legendary company that continues to make history. If I hadn't been excited, there would have been something wrong with me.) FREE AppDownload
