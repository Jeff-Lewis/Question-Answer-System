The company said the offering of 140 million shares was expected to be priced at between $23 and $25 each. At the top end of the range the company will be valued at $14 billion. (http://1.usa.gov/1tlcS0t) All the shares in the offering are being sold by RBS. RBS said last year it would sell 20-25 percent of Citizens by the end of 2014 through a U.S. IPO as the bank faces pressure from British regulators to bolster its capital and sell off non-core assets. Citizens, which provides retail and commercial banking services to about 5 million customers in the United States, intends to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CFG". Citizens had $130.3 billion of total assets and more than 1,200 branches in 11 states across the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions as of June 30. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and JPMorgan are the lead underwriters for the IPO.  (Reporting By Neha Dimri in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) FREE AppDownload
