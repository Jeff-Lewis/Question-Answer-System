Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne took out a full-page ad in this morning's Wall Street Journal shredding billionaire Steven Cohen for his hedge fund's indictment by a Federal Grand Jury earlier this week. The firm, SAC Capital, has been charged with insider trading. Byrne's animosity didn't come out of nowhere — on a 20o5 conference call the CEO of Overstock.com said that "Sith Lords" were naked short-selling his stock and destroying the company. He later identified them to be SAC's Steve Cohen and Michael Milken. And indeed, last year a bunch of lawyers for major banks accidentally leaked emails describing how they allegedly short-sold the stock and leaked techniques to hedge fund clients. Now that you know where all the hate comes from, check out the ad below (via Instagram: ognjenglisic) "Congratulations on the indictment, Stevie, and remember: roll early, roll often. You friend Patrick M. Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com," it reads. Major schadenfreude.             					                                                                                                                                            facebook                                                                        linkedin                                                                        twitter                                                                        google+                                                                        email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                email                                                                                        share                                                                         share                                                                         tweet                                                                         share                                                                         email                                                                                        Share on Facebook                                                                         Share on Twitter                                                                         Share on Linkedin                                                                         Share on Google Plus                                                                         email                                                            Recommended For You                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];                                    _taboola.push({mode:'thumbs-1r', container:'taboola-below-main-column', placement:'below-main-column'});                                                                                                                        Comments             Comments on this post are now closed.
