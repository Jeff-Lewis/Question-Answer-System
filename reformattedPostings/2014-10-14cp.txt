The Financial Conduct Authority said that 9,858 cases had been settled by Barclays , HSBC , Lloyds Banking Group  and Royal Bank of Scotland . The products were supposed to protect smaller companies against rising interest rates but, when rates fell, the companies had to pay large bills, typically running to tens of thousands of pounds. Companies also faced penalties to get out of the deals, which many said they had not been told about.  (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Laura Noonan) FREE AppDownload
