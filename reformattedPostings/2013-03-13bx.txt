Another awful European economic datapoint. Industrial production fell 0.4% in January. It was expected to decline by just 0.1%. From the report: In January 2013 compared with December 2012, seasonally adjusted industrial production fell by 0.4% in both the euro area (EA17) and the EU272, according to estimates released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. In December 20123 production grew by 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. In January 2013 compared with January 20124, industrial production decreased by 1.3% in the euro area and by 1.7% in the EU27. Ultimately not much new. The economy is bad. Eurostat
