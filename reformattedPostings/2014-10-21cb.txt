Lockheed posted third quarter profit of $888 million for the third quarter, or $2.76 per diluted share, as revenues fell two percent to $11.1 billion. This was ahead of the $2.72 per share expected by economists. Operating margins edged lower at each of the company's five divisions in the quarter, with the trend most noticeable in the aeronautics sector, which builds the F-35 fighter jet. The division reported a 12 percent drop in earnings to $362 million, and its operating margin fell to 10.2 percent from 11.3 percent.   (Reporting by Andrea Shalal Editing by W Simon) FREE AppDownload
