REUTERS/ Lucas JacksonU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara — the "Sheriff of Wall Street" — sat down with Bloomberg Businessweek for its annual interview issue. Bharara is known for his biting sense of humor and ruthless pursuit of insider trading cases. So how does the man who threatens to take down SAC Capital start his day?

Raw meat, OK.And when raw meat is unavailable, I eat a granola bar every morning and a Diet Coke. Bharara did strike a more serious tone too.
