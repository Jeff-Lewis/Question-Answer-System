The complaint about the restrictions on the highly prized commodities was made by the United States, European Union and Japan two years ago. "This victory shows that we stand prepared to take action whenever necessary to protect the high-quality middle class American jobs that trade supports," U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in an emailed statement. The WTO is expected to publish its ruling in the case later on Wednesday. Any of the parties in the case can appeal within 60 days. China produces more than 90 percent of the world's rare earth elements, which are used in a wide range of applications in sectors like renewable energy, telecommunications and defense. The United States, Europe and Japan complained export restrictions, including duties and quotas, gave Chinese companies in key high-tech sectors an unfair competitive edge. "China's decision to promote its own industry and discriminate against U.S. companies has caused U.S. manufacturers to pay as much as three times more than what their Chinese competitors pay for the exact same rare earths," Froman said. "WTO rules prohibit this kind of discriminatory export restraint." For its part, China has said rampant overmining has caused ecological damage and that it no longer wants to pay the environmental costs of supplying the vast bulk of the world's rare earths. In 2013, it capped rare earth production at 93,800 tones. Chinese officials were not immediately available for comment.
