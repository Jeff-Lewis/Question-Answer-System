Flickr/Julie FalkThousands of ambitious financial analysts around the world will sit for one of the three the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams this weekend. The very few candidates who are taking the level III exam will be tested on a fun topic: behavioral finance. "Investors are 'normal,' not rational," says Meir Statman, one of the leading thinkers in behavioral finance. Behavioral finance reconciles the discrepancy between rational valuation and irrational market pricing. It's a booming field of study.  Top behavioral finance gurus include Yale's Robert Shiller and GMO's James Montier. We compiled a list of the seven common behavioral biases that drive investor decisions.  Read through them, and you'll quickly realize why you make such terrible financial decisions. NOTE: These definitions are derived from Hersh Shefrin's Beyond Greed And Fear, which was required reading in the CFA Institute's Level III curriculum in 2009. FREE AppDownload
