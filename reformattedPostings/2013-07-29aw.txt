REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschThat didn't take long. After ditching junk bonds at a record pace in June on the news that the Federal Reserve might slow its asset purchasing program soon, investors are buying them back up at a record pace. Junk bonds netted a record $5.4 billion of deposits last week while investors pulled $1.8 billion from investment grade, according to Bloomberg. We broke down the week's flows into junk bonds last week. It's an indication that investors are preferring higher-yield junk bonds over the stability of corporate or municipal bonds. From Bloomberg: Relative yields on high-yield bonds globally were 511 basis points on July 26 compared with the all-time low of 233 in June 2007, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Spreads on investment-grade notes of 150 basis points are up from this year’s low of 132 on May 28. The so-called Great Rotation — a concept that came to vogue earlier this year when investors poured money into equity funds stoking fears that bonds would see a mass exodus — has yet to materialize.
