Another analyst told Reuters that the news was totally unexpected.  "There did not appear to be any sign of impending change when management openly interacted with investors last week," Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said.  Hanson also appears to have been popular with associates.  One excited worker excitedly tweeted after he received a shout-out in a company memo:  Currently cannot hold in my joy due to the fact that @AEO 's CEO, Robert Hanson, gave me a shoutout!!! Aahhh!!! pic.twitter.com/IESeMsUJuv Sozzi notes that the company has a new chief merchant starting in February, and has considered spinning off its Aerie lingerie business.  We contacted the company for additional comments about Hanson's departure, but haven't heard back.  FREE AppDownload
