FlickrHousing starts plummeted in August. Starts fell 14.4% to an annualized rate of 956,000. This is the biggest drop since April 2013. Economists were expecting the pace of starts to decline 5.2% to 1.04 milion. Building permits dropped 5.6% to an annualized rate of 998,000, which was worse than the 1.04 million rate expected. Economists warn we shouldn't freak out about this report. "In one line: Less bad than the grim headlines, but still soft," Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson said. "The trend, as far as we can tell, is about flat following the winter plunge and spring rebound." "Because the housing starts data are volatile on a monthly basis, these data do not change our view that a moderate housing recovery remains on track," Barclays' Dean Maki said. "One way to see this is by looking at y/y changes; single-family starts rose 4.2% y/y in August, while multifamily starts rose 16.8%."
