Business InsiderThis sign is in Amazon's main building. It tells you all you need to know about the company. After last night's earnings report, investors were fleeing Amazon on Friday morning.  The stock was down 11.2% to start the day.  Amazon's earnings report fit a familiar pattern: Revenue met expectations growing 23% on a year-over-year basis, but it had a $126 million loss, which was much worse than expected.  On top of that, it forecast a gargantuan loss of $410 million to $810 million for the next quarter. Analysts were only expecting a $10 million loss next quarter, according to Bloomberg terminal information.  For years Amazon has grown sales at the expense of the bottom line, and for years investors have been OK with it. It seems like their patience is currently running out.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions. FREE AppDownload
