William Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, spoke yesterday about the state of the New York, New Jersey, and U.S. economies.  The quote you need to know: "There have been significant and long-lasting changes to the nature of work," he said. That's true, both in the Empire State and nationwide. And though the changes began prior to the Great Recession, they have accelerated since its end. New York Fed senior economist Jaison Abel then gave a follow-up presentation that pinpointed what Dudley was referring to: middle-skill jobs are vaporizing.

First, they show that the decades-long process of job polarization—that is, a loss in middle-skill jobs combined with job growth at the upper and lower ends of the skills distribution—has continued through the latest business cycle. Second, ongoing weakness in housing has meant that there has been little bounceback in construction jobs. Finally, fiscal pressures in the public sector, which accelerated after the recession as stimulus spending wound down, have resulted in fewer teachers and cuts in state and local government jobs.  So while a growing number of places in the region have gained back the number of jobs lost during the Great Recession, the types of jobs in the region have changed: job growth has been geared toward higher- and lower-skilled workers, with job opportunities in the middle continuing to shrink.  This is the death of the middle class in real time.  (Via Delong) FREE AppDownload
