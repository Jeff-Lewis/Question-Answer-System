Margin Call screenshotWeekly initial jobless claims totaled 302,000. Expectations were for claims to total 310,000. Continuing jobless claims totaled 2,507,000, up/down from last week's 2,584,000. According to the Department of Labor, the 4-week moving average of initial claims fell to its lowest level since June 2007. "The 4-week moving average was 309,000, a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week's revised average. This is the lowest level for this average since June 2, 2007 when it was 307,500. The previous week's average was revised up by 500 from 311,500 to 312,000," the report said." The 4-week average for continuing claims also fell to 2,559,000, the lowest level for the average since October 2007. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Claims are still trending downwards; a much better guide to the economy right now than housing starts... This time last year, the trend is claims was about 345K, so the improvement has been substantial, and more than enough to support a clear acceleration in payroll growth from last year's average 194K average."  Last week, jobless claims came in at 304,000, but were revised up to 305,000 with the latest report.  FREE AppDownload
