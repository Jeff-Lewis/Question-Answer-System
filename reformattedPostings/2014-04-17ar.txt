REUTERS/Brendan McDermidIllinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan is probing Herbalife, CNBC's Scott Wapner reported. Herbalife issued the following statement: "We have more than 15,000 members and many more thousands of satisfied customers in Illinois.  We will continue to provide the outstanding products and services that they have come to expect from Herbalife over the past three decades. We will always support the good work of our members" "We are confident in the integrity of our longstanding business and the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We look forward to working with the Illinois Attorney General’s office to resolve the consumer complaints it has received."  Herbalife is a multi-level marketing company that sells weight loss shakes and nutritional supplements. The stock fell about 2 percent following the news. It was last off about 0.5%. Herbalife has been at the cross-hairs of a nasty battle between hedge fund billionaires.  Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, is shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife. Ackman believes the company operates as a "pyramid scheme". He has a price target of $0. In other words, it's Ackman's contention that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will shut the company down.  Ackman's arch-nemesis, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, snapped up a large position in the stock shortly after Ackman publicly revealed his short position. He owns 16.8% of Herbalife's shares. Last month, Herbalife confirmed last month that it's under investigation by the FTC. The Financial Times reported last Friday that the company was being probed by the DOJ and the FBI. The company said in statement that they had no knowledge of any ongoing investigation by the DOJ or the FBI.  The New York Post also reported this week that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office is probing Herbalife.  FREE AppDownload
