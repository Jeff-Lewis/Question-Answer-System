They have some pretty sweet amenities, too.   Many of these clubs prohibit business meetings and the use of cellphones, offering a reprieve from the work day. Others aren't as strict on conducting business.      We've selected 10 of the city's most exclusive clubs and detailed why they would be ideal for the Wall Street crowd.
