Last night, Obama called for Congress to enact a $9 minimum wage. It's a controversial call (some people argue that a minimum wage destroys low-end jobs), and it's unlikely to come to pass in this Congress. But in 2014, it's conceivable. Anyway, the fast food companies (Burger King, Wendy's, McDonald's) are all down today. And it seems possible there's a connection, though it's impossible to know. McDonald's is getting hit the most.
