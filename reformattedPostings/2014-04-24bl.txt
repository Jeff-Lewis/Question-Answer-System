Wikimedia CommonsUPS just announced its Q1 financial results, and at first glance it doesn't look great. Q1 earnings fell to $0.98 per share, missing analysts' expectation for $1.08. Operating profit fell $106 million year-over-year to $1.5 billion. The stock is down by 1.2% in pre-market trading. Because it ships stuff all over the world, UPS is considered a reliable bellwether of the economy. But in big bold letters, UPS blames the weather. In fact, the title of the company's earnings announcement was "Weather Impacts UPS 1Q Results." "Unusually harsh weather weighed on operating profit by approximately $200 million, due to increased expenses and slower revenue growth," said management. Here are some operating stats: “During the quarter, the momentum of the underlying business was masked by the disruption of inclement weather,” said CFO Kurt Kuehn. “We are encouraged by the positive trends in our business and expect the remainder of the year to perform as we originally guided. However, due to the challenging start to 2014, we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be at the low end of our full-year guidance range of $5.05 to $5.30.” Analysts have been expecting the company to earn $5.19.
