Stephen L. Weiss“The trading room fell quiet as Vernon Albright stormed across the <U+FB02>oor, the thick carpet doing little to mute the anger evident in each step. The traders had seen him this way before and feared the worst…” So begins UNHEDGED, the newest book by renowned hedge fund manager Stephen Weiss. Weiss has a storied career on Wall Street, and has been an executive at Salomon Brothers, SAC Capital, and Lehman Brothers while also contributing to CNBC’s Fast Money. He’s written two books before – The Billion Dollar Mistake and The Big Win – but while those were investment books, his latest work is a financial thriller. UNHEDGED chronicles the tale of billionaire hedge fund manager Vernon Albright, who has struck a deal with the devil – shady oilman Buck Hendricks – to enhance his riches and avoid jail time. We’ve got a sneak peek of the first two chapters, published below. You can find copies of UNHEDGED available at Amazon. The trading room fell quiet as Vernon Albright stormedacross the <U+FB02>oor, the thick carpet doing little to mute theanger evident in each step. The traders had seen him thisway before and feared the worst. They tried hard to fadeinto the background, averting their eyes and punchingphantom stock symbols into their keyboards. As Albrightpassed each desk, the dread of being his next victim gaveway to barely contained sighs of relief.Albright stopped at the desk of Parthenon’s newest em-ployee, towering over his target. His booming voice echoedo<U+FB00> the walls. “Sell the fucking stock.”“But the shares are only down a quarter. I know they’llgo higher.”The portfolio manager’s <U+FB01>rst mistake was putting on thetwo-hundred-million-dollar position but that was, after all,what he was hired to do. His second misstep, perhaps themore egregious error in judgment, was talking back to Ver-non Albright. Freedom of speech was an unknown conceptat Parthenon Capital, where only one opinion mattered.That and bottom line results. He had been at Parthenon forall of three weeks, but it was not the <U+FB01>rst time he regrettedleaving his highly paid position at Morgan Stanley.“What don’t you understand? This isn’t open to a vote. Isaid to sell the fucking position. And by the way, you moron,on twenty million shares, that quarter is costing me <U+FB01>vemillion.”The man was dazed; he felt like he had just beensmacked across the back of his head with a two by four.He knew Albright’s reputation for churning employees and had aired it as a concern during the recruiting process. Al-bright’s response now echoed in his mind. “I never shouldhave hired those people; they didn’t have your experience.You’re di<U+FB00>erent, much more accomplished, someone I cantrust and give complete autonomy.” He took the job. What’smy downside? Even if I get <U+FB01>red after a year, I’ll have mademore money than I earned the last <U+FB01>ve. Against the advice ofmany, he rejected a substantial counter bid from Morganand accepted Albright’s more generous o<U+FB00>er.“This isn’t what we agreed upon. You said I could tradewithout your supervision.”“Tell you what, genius,” Albright responded in his mostcondescending tone, “going forward you can trade all youlike without my supervision because we’re done. Actually,you’re done. Down <U+FB01>ve million in less than one month is arecord. I have no intention of letting you pad your legacy.”He knew it wasn’t unusual for tempers to <U+FB02>are whenthe market got hit although he had never witnessed, norbeen the victim of, such a public <U+FB02>ogging. He also realizedthat o<U+FB00>ering further rebuttal was senseless. Composurebarely intact, the best defense at this point was to grab acup of co<U+FB00>ee and hope the incident would die down untilit could be discussed in more private surroundings. Hepushed his chair away from the desk, gaining distance fromAlbright’s menacing glare. As beaten down as a chastisedpuppy, he rose from his seat and started toward the pantry.From Master of the Universe to poor bastard in less than aminute.“You’re going in the wrong direction, just like the stocksyou buy,” Albright bellowed as a wry smile spread acrosshis lips. “The elevators are that way.” He extended his armand pointed toward the reception area.Joseph, Albright’s personal bodyguard and head ofParthenon’s small security detail stepped in. “It’s probablybest to do as Mr. Albright suggests,” he advised in a voicethat was slightly above a whisper. “He doesn’t usuallychange his mind. Your personal items will be sent to your home.”His humiliation was pushed aside by anger, rage evidentin his eyes and the clenching of his <U+FB01>sts. He took a steptoward Albright but Joseph’s vise-like grip caught his arm,holding him in place.“Time to go,” Joseph said while placing his other handon the man’s back, directing him toward the exit.“Parthenon isn’t for the weak or the stupid,” Albrightremarked for all to hear as the latest casualty exited throughthe glass doors.And so ended another “career” at Parthenon. It wasn’tthe shortest tenure on record. That distinction belongedto a portfolio manager who lasted all of three days. Hismistake? He went out to lunch and returned an hour later.The markets didn’t take time o<U+FB00> during the trading dayand neither did Parthenon. He didn’t even make it past thelobby when he returned. His electronic building pass hadalready been voided.Albright was still incensed as he returned to his o<U+FB03>ce.He was tired of these high priced hires squandering theopportunity he had given them and damn tired of havingto go through the inconvenience of bringing in someonenew. He sat at his desk and mentally ran through a listof ten potential replacements, portfolio managers at other<U+FB01>rms he had met with in the event the inevitable occurred.Almost out of re<U+FB02>ex, the process of compiling a list ofcandidates began immediately upon the <U+FB01>rst misstep of thelatest hire. After a few minutes of deliberation, he settledupon a name.“Get me Jeremy Cranford.” Albright barked to his secre-tary.Incredibly, and in de<U+FB01>ance of all precedent, that wasthree years ago; Cranford had survived the odds but hewould soon have to outlive more severe threats than thoseto his career.
