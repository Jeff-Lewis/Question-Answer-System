Stocks aren't doing much Friday, but one asset is having a huge day: gold. In afternoon trade Friday, the precious metal was up more than 2.5%, or about $25 an ounce, to about $1,192. This is the highest level gold has traded at since the metal broke below $1,200 late last month. Overall, gold is still near multiyear lows, but on a day when there is a bit of a "flight to safety" feel in the market, with US Treasury yields falling a bit and precious metals rallying, gold is ending the week on a positive note.   Here's the chart of gold's rally Friday.
