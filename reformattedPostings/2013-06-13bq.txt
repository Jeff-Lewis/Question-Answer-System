At 8:30 AM, we got a weekly report on initial jobless claims and an advance retail sales report for May, and both beat consensus expectations. Following the releases, stocks are rallying, and the dollar is surging against the yen. Meanwhile, gold and Treasuries are getting slammed. S&amp;P 500 futures are trading at 1613, up 0.2%, versus levels around 1605 prior to the release. The dollar-yen exchange rate is ¥94.54 versus levels around ¥94 before the reports. Gold is at $1377 an ounce, down 1.1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is still 1 basis point lower, at 2.22%, but it's rising following the reports. The dominant story in global markets has been the rise in Treasury yields since May 3, when the April employment report was released. Because the Federal Reserve has tied the timetable for tapering back monetary stimulus directly to specific economic data thresholds, improving economic data is helping to fuel fears that the pace of bond purchases the Fed makes could slow sooner than expected.
