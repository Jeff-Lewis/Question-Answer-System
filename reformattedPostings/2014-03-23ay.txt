Stephanie Abrams FacebookThe Weather Channel's Stephanie AbramsToday, March 23, is World Meteorological Day. To celebrate the occasion, we've rounded up a fun group of weather experts and climate reporters who are active on social media and helping to make normally complicated data accessible to the general public.  They use terms that everyone can understand and push out maps that make snowstorms, hurricanes, and other weather-related happenings interesting. Below is a list of the some best weather people to follow on Twitter. You might even learn some meteorology.
