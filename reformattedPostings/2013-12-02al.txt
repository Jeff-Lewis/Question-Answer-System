LinkUpToby Dayton is the CEO of LinkUp, an online job search engine that only indexes listings posted directly on company websites. LinkUp data are being used by major investment banks on Wall Street to forecast job growth. The rationale is that a rise in job openings should naturally presage a rise in hiring. In a recent blog post, Dayton posted the map at right, which shows growth in job openings by state over the first nine months of 2013. The first thing that jumps out from the map is that the Pacific Northwest region is looking pretty hot compared to the rest of the country.
