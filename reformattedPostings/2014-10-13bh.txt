REUTERS/Shannon StapletonNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson speaks during a news conference on the plans for Super Bowl XLVIII, at New York City Hall January 24, 2013. Super Bowl XLVIII will be held on February 2, 2014 at Meadowlands Sports Complex's MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, making it the first Super Bowl to be played outdoors. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who has been quietly shopping around his 834 Fifth Avenue co-op, has reportedly accepted a record-breaking $80 million offer.  Should the deal for the 14-room duplex close for that amount, it would set a new record for the most expensive co-op ever sold in New York City.  Currently, that title is held by Israel Englander’s $71.3 million purchase of the French ambassador to the United Nations’ 18-room duplex at 740 Park Avenue in June. Prior to that deal, Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris briefly held the record following his $70 million purchase of the Bronfman penthouse at 960 Fifth Avenue, as The Real Deal reported at the time. The billionaire, who is also heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, listed the 11th- and 12th-floor unit for $75 million earlier this month. The pad boasts five-and-a-half bathrooms and three maids’ rooms, and is located in a 16-story Art Deco building designed by Rosario Candela. Johnson reportedly never actually lived in the apartment, and now resides at One Central Park West. [NYP] and [Curbed] FREE AppDownload
