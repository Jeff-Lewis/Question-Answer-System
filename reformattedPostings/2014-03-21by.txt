Seven of the 10 carload commodity groups posted increases compared with the same week in 2013, led by grain with 21,045 carloads, up 21 percent. Commodities showing a decrease compared with the same week last year were led by motor vehicles and parts with 17,936 carloads, down 8 percent. For the first 11 weeks of 2014, U.S. railroads reported cumulative volume of 3,009,897 carloads, even compared with the same point last year, and 2,677,098 intermodal units, up 2.3 percent from last year. Total combined U.S. traffic for the first 11 weeks of 2014 was 5,686,995 carloads and intermodal units, up 1.1 percent from last year.&#8221;   Muddle through will not be enough to justify the expectations built into equities now. 1. Significant service issues at one of the western railroads has forced some Agricultural commodity shippers to ship via intermodal rather than in traditional shuttle covered hopper service. This &#8220;Ag in a box&#8221; is a  mix phenomenon and does not indicate economic expansion.   2. There is a moderate trend increase in railroad market share vs. long haul trucking which makes this measure look more favorable. Again, not an indicator of economy wide expansion Back in the day, Cullen posted all RR traffic. But that was being skewed by the rapid growth of crude by rail and so he switched to just intermodal. But similar problems are still imbedded.
