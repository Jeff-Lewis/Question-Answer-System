ShutterstockGoldman Sachs recently released its "Hedge Fund Trend Monitor," a massive report detailing the fourth quarter investment moves made by the world's biggest hedge funds. The report included a list of "most concentrated" stocks.  These are the companies for which huge shares of their outstanding stocks are owned by hedge funds. Goldman found that these stocks tend to do very well in upward trending markets, but they also do poorly in downward trending ones. From the report: The “most concentrated” stocks lagged for most of 2007 and 2008, but significantly outperformed in 2009 (81.4% vs. 26.5%) and 2010 (15.9% vs. 15.1%). Our “most concentrated” basket underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 391 bp in 2011 (-1.8% vs. 2.1%) but outperformed by 814 bp in 2012 (24.1% vs. 16.0%). We pulled the 20 stocks with the largest hedge fund ownership stakes according to Goldman's report. All stocks listed have between 19-36% of their outstanding shares owned by hedge funds. We also included the names of the five hedge funds with the largest stakes. FREE AppDownload
