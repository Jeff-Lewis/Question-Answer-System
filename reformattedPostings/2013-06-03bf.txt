There's not much to say about what happened to the Istanbul stock exchange today. Following a week of brutal riots, the market got destroyed to the tune of 10%. Meanwhile, for some great financial market/econ perspective on Turkey, go read @pawelmorski, who makes the important observation that you can't just analogize Turkey to some other "revolution" in the world. Inequality hasn't been a huge problem, and jobs have been plentiful. And of course, up until recently financial markets have been on a gigantic tear.
