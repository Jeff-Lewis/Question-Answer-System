But the stock markets will be open. There isn't too much major economic data to follow. But it'll arguably be the beginning of the Janet Yellen era of monetary policy. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Yellen heads to Washington Thursday for her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary All-time highs and stretched valuations have some people freaked out that we may be doomed for a stock market crash. Societe Generale's Alain Bokobza is concerned, but he isn't quite so dramatic:  "Further S&amp;P 500 progression from current level is unlikely as U.S. government bond yields head higher in 2014. We expect U.S. government bond yields to approach 4% by Dec. 2014. At that level of yield, and with the normalisation of the risk premiums from rather cheap today (4.65%) to their long-term average (3.9%, which is an optimistic assumption), this would leave no room for U.S. equities to continue progressing after already five years of sustained equity index rise (+51% total return since the Lehman crisis). "Potential for a near-term correction in U.S. equities can’t be ruled out. The FED will eventually bring tapering back on the agenda in 2014. After all, does real GDP growth of 2.8% in the last quarter really deserve not only zero rates but also active monetary injection? Our analysis suggests that a U.S. government bond yield between 3% and 3.5% could trigger a correction of between -12% and -22% on the current ERP."  FREE AppDownload
