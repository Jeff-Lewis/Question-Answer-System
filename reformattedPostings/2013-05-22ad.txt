ND Strupler via FlickrThe housing market has been showing signs of strength. Economists expect home prices to rise 8% this year and then grow at a more modest pace beyond that.  Over the next five years, national home prices are projected to rise at an average 3.5% rate, according to the latest CoreLogic Case-Shiller report. Of course, there will be laggards. We drew on the latest data to identify the worst housing markets for the next five years — the markets with the lowest home price growth. The 15 cities are ranked by the projected annualized change in home prices between Q4 2012 and Q4 2017. Note: The median family income and home price is for Q4 2012. Unemployment data is as of February 2013, and population data for the metros is for 2011. FREE AppDownload
