Wikimedia CommonsOn Friday, everyone across Wall Street was absolutely transfixed when hedge fund titans Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn, who have been notoriously feuding for a decade now, went head-to-head on CNBC's "Halftime Report." The insults were flying with Icahn calling Ackman a "crybaby in the schoolyard" and dropping curse words left and right.  Ackman, who refrained from using profanity, mostly called Icahn dishonest and not a nice person. The best part, though, was that you could hear the floor brokers and market-makers at the New York Stock Exchange oohing in the background as the epic battle of the billionaires played out.   Of course, Icahn and Ackman aren't the first to fight on Wall Street.
