There were huge pro-Democracy protests in Hong Kong this week, and as we already noted, state media in China reacted pretty awkwardly, describing the event as a big chance for everyone to exercise and have a jolly old time. That wasn't the only hilarious response to the protests, however. The media also tried to depict a massive pro-mainland demonstration. Except as internet sleuths quickly observed (via @cloudyip) the propagandists failed Photoshop 101. This was supposedly a photo of a 500,000 strong pro-mainland protest, except even in a tiny crowd, you can see the same faces used multiple times.
