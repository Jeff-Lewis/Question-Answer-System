Running a startup is difficult. It's hard to meet the right people. It can be lonely at times. It's tough to get attention for your fledgling venture. Money is tight, and sometimes that prevents young companies from participating at events that would help them solve these challenges. Business Insider's STARTUP 2013 conference knows this and is here to help.  "Startup Row" exhibits are available for $999.  This specially-priced event sponsorship is for startups that are under 2 years old and have raised less then $2 million in funding. Exhibiting on Startup Row is a great way to get your product or app noticed, network, and learn how to take your company to the next level at NYC's premier entrepreneurship conference. Sponsorship includes: There are a limited number of startup row exhibits available, so register today! Startup offers a jam-packed agenda with a morning full of classes from General Assembly -- you'll have the opportunity to select your own curriculum from 15+ carefully-curated classes -- and an afternoon of insights from top entrepreneurs and VCs, including:  If you have questions about Startup Row or other sponsorship opportunities at Startup 2013, please contact events@businessinsider.com.
