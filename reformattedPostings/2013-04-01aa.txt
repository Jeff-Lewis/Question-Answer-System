The 65-year-old Pegasus pipeline remained shut off on Monday as emergency crews continue to contain the spill, Exxon said in a statement on Monday.  The cause of the spill is still under investigation, the company said.  Twenty-two homes were evacuated after oil painted lawns, roads, and some ducks. About 12,000 barrels of oil and water have been recovered so far, Exxon said.
