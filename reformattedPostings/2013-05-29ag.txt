Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesU.S. foreclosure inventory, which refers to properties in some stage of foreclosure, equaled 1.1 million in April, according to CoreLogic's latest report. This was down 24% from 1.5 million a year ago. It was also down 2 percent from March. Foreclosure inventory represented 2.8% of all homes with a mortgage, compared with 3.5% a year ago. Meanwhile, there were 52,000 completed foreclosures in April, the same as March. But this was down from 62,000 a year ago. Before the housing bust, completed foreclosures averaged about 21,000 a month. Home prices have been boosted by tight supply, especially a decline in the stock of distressed properties. "Fewer distressed properties combined with improving home prices and a pickup in home purchases are significant signals that the ongoing recovery in the housing and mortgage markets continues to gather steam," said Anand Nallathambi, president of CoreLogic in a press release.
