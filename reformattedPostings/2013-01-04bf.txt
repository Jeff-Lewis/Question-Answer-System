It's jobs day in America. This morning we learned that the U.S. economy added 155k jobs in December and the unemployment rate ticked up in 7.8 percent.  Although the numbers were in line with economists' expectations, they still reflect a job market that remains incredibly weak almost four years into the economic recovery.
