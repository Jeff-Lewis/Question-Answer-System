Jeopardy screengrabWe totally geeked out when 'Teen Jeopardy' featured a category for the Federal Reserve on tonight's episode.  The teens made it through the category answering all the questions.  There were a couple stumbles from two of the contestants, but overall we were impressed.  We've included the answers in the slides that follow. See if your Fed knowledge is on par with these Jeopardy teens.  FREE AppDownload
