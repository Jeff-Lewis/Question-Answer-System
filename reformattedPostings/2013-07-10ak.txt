REUTERS/Jim YoungU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke listens to his introduction prior to speaking at the Regional Leaders Issues Conference in Washington at the Library of Congress in Washington, June 13, 2006. Ben Bernanke is commenting on monetary policy following the speech he just delivered at the NBER conference in Boston this afternoon. The Federal Reserve chairman is striking a decidedly dovish tone in the Q&amp;A, and investors are buying Treasury futures in after-hours trading. His remarks help to clear up the confusion that has gripped the bond market in recent weeks. The gist is this: Just because the Fed may begin tapering soon, interest rates will still be pinned at current ultra-low levels for a long time. Bernanke said that the unemployment rate – a key indicator that will determine the future path of Fed monetary policy – probably understates the weakness in the U.S. labor market. That the onset of tapering should not be taken as a sign of an imminent rate hikes is something that the Fed has communicated in various ways, but has not spelled out this cogently or forcefully. Two other points that Bernanke really drove home hard: Bottom line: No rate hike for a long time, and the interest rate spike is of some concern to the Fed. Stocks and bonds are soaring in after-hours trading.
