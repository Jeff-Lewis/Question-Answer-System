DoubleLine"This Time It's Different." DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach just wrapped up his latest webcast, outlining why this time, when the Fed hikes interest rates, it will be different. Gundlach, who said recently that the US dollar looks set to go even higher said that, if crude oil falls to $40 the 10-year yield could fall to 1%.  Gundlach also highlighted a few things that, to him, make it appear that "all is not right" in the global markets.  Oil has cratered. Two-year yields have gone negative in Germany, meaning investors are paying the German government to keep their money.  And with the situation in Greece now appearing more unstable, Gundlach is not convinced that there isn't something wrong in the global economy.  On specific investing themes, Gundlach said that he has allocated some money to junk bonds after having almost no money in the sector at the beginning of this year.  Gundlach is also closely watching the Treasury yield curve, which has been flattening this year, meaning that short-term rates have been rising while longer-date Treasury yields have been falling.
