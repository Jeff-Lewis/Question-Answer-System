APPresident Barack Obama just wrapped up his address to the joint session of Congress — the annual State of the Union address. Check our liveblog for a full recap of the speech. Here's a look at mentions of "Dorner," the ex-cop fugitive in California, vs. "State of the Union" in the last 24 hours, via Bloomberg's Jared Keller:  Better pic:  &nbsp; It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country &ndash; the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love." &nbsp; Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.&nbsp; The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can&rsquo;t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what tax reform can deliver.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we can do together. &nbsp; I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won&rsquo;t be easy.&nbsp; The politics will be hard for both sides.&nbsp; None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.&nbsp; But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans." The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.&nbsp; I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.&nbsp; But if Congress won&rsquo;t act soon to protect future generations, I will.&nbsp; I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy." &nbsp; Tonight, I propose a &ldquo;Fix-It-First&rdquo; program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.&nbsp; And to make sure taxpayers don&rsquo;t shoulder the whole burden, I&rsquo;m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America.&nbsp; And let&rsquo;s start right away." &nbsp; But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.&nbsp; Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it.&nbsp; Right now, there&rsquo;s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today&rsquo;s rates.&nbsp; Democrats and Republicans have supported it before.&nbsp; What are we waiting for?&nbsp; Take a vote, and send me that bill.&nbsp; Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s holding us back?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s streamline the process, and help our economy grow." &nbsp; We need to give every American student opportunities like this.&nbsp; Four years ago, we started Race to the Top &ndash; a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.&nbsp; Tonight, I&rsquo;m announcing a new challenge to redesign America&rsquo;s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math &ndash; the skills today&rsquo;s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future." &nbsp; Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship &ndash; a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.&nbsp; &nbsp; And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy." &nbsp; Beyond 2014, America&rsquo;s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.&nbsp; We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates. &nbsp; Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.&nbsp; Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged &ndash; from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.&nbsp; The threat these groups pose is evolving.&nbsp; But to meet this threat, we don&rsquo;t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.&nbsp; Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.&nbsp; And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.  &nbsp; One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.&nbsp; She was 15 years old.&nbsp; She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.&nbsp; She was a majorette.&nbsp; She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.&nbsp; Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration.&nbsp; And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. &nbsp; Hadiya&rsquo;s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.&nbsp; They deserve a vote. &nbsp; Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. &nbsp; The families of Newtown deserve a vote. &nbsp; The families of Aurora deserve a vote. &nbsp; The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence &ndash; they deserve a simple vote."
