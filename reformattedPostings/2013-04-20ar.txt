On Friday night, shortly after 9 p.m., police in Boston arrested Dzokhar Tsarnaev, a suspect in the bombing of the Boston Marathon, which killed three people. Tsarnaev's picture had been shown to the public the previous afternoon. Within a few hours, police were in pursuit of Dzokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, first in Cambridge, then in Watertown, which spent virtually the entire day in lockdown, as authorities searched every residence, door to door. Not long after the lockdown was lifted, police responded to reports of activity in a boat behind someone's home. Shots rang out, and after more than an hour, the suspect was eventually arrested alive. Imagine seeing this out your window.  FREE AppDownload
