Radiohead lead singer Thom Yorke has pulled his solo material, as well as music by his new band Atoms for Peace, from Spotify. The tracks are already gone. And in a series of Tweets, Yorke blasted the streaming music service: Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid. meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples. “your small meaningless rebellion is only hurting your fans ... a drop in the bucket really” No we're standing up for our fellow musicians for me In Rainbows was a statement of trust .people still value new music ..that's all we'd like from Spotify. don't make us the target. Anyway. Here's one. We're off of Spotify.. Can't do that no more man.. Small meaningless rebellion. Someone gotta say something. It's bad for new music.. The reason is that new artists get paid fuck all with this model.. It's an equation that just doesn't work Plus people are scared to speak up or not take part as they are told they will lose invaluable exposure if they don't play ball. Meanwhile.. Millions of streams gets them a few thousand dollars.. Not like radio at all.. Anyway. Thems the breaks. Opinions welcome.. but discussion and new thinking necessary.. If you have a massive catalogue - a major label... ..for example.. then you're quids in. It's money for old rope.. But making new recorded music needs funding.. Some records can be made in .. .. a laptop, but some need musician and skilled technicians.. These things cost money.. Pink floyds catalogue has already generated billions .. of dollars for someone(not necessarily the band) so now putting it on a streaming site makes total sense.. But if people had been .. ..listening to spotify instead of buying records in 1973... I doubt very much if dark side would have been made.. It would just be too .. ..expensive.
