Daniel KriegerThe dining room at Le Bernardin.Michelin released its 2015 ratings for New York City today, and only six restaurants received a highly coveted three-star rating. Daniel Boulud's Daniel, which had received three stars for each of the past five years, lost a star in the new guidebook. That means there are just nine restaurants in the U.S. with top ratings from the prestigious guide, which uses anonymous inspectors to judge restaurants around the world. It's important to note that Michelin only publishes guides for three U.S. cities: New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, so the company's ratings are not all-encompassing. The remaining three-star restaurants in the U.S. are:  Ripert's Le Bernardin also recently topped Business Insider's list of the 45 best restaurants in America. Eleven Madison Park came in second on that list, followed by The French Laundry, Per Se, and Daniel. There are also only six New York City restaurants with four-star rankings from The New York Times, the paper's highest honor. They are Del Posto, Eleven Madison Park, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Per Se, and Sushi Nakazawa, a highly acclaimed sushi bar in the West Village that some are saying was snubbed by Michelin after it was not recognized in its 2015 guide (and which The Times named the best restaurant of 2013).
