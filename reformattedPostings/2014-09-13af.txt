REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonTesla CEO Elon Musk.Tesla stock is up 1,400% since the middle of 2010, just as the company began to realize Elon Musk’s vision and grow its revenue base. Of course, Musk is not without his own opinion on the stock price. On September 4th, while finally announcing the much anticipated location of Tesla’s Gigafactory (Nevada), Musk also offered a valuation assessment: “I think our stock price is kind of high right now.” The stock dropped from its all-time high, but has found a steady equilibrium since the declaration. Of greater interest to Tesla shareholders is the promise of the Gigafactory, with projections pointing to 500,000 cars built and delivered per year by 2020. In 2013, Tesla sold  about 25,000 cars. When looking for a valuation methodology for Tesla, don’t look to Elon Musk, but to a single fundamental measure of the firm: revenue. This chart shows Tesla's total revenue against its stock price over the last four years, and from this chart we could make an argument that not only have we found the right valuation methodology for the company, but that Tesla stock is priced perfectly.
