REUTERS/Brendan McDermidWednesday's 400-point plunge in the Dow has investors a bit freaked out. So what's behind the sell-off? Rich Barry, an NYSE floor governor, identified seven catalysts in an email he just blasted from the New York Stock Exchange floor: 1. A shockingly weak Retail Sales report that hit the tape at 8:30 a.m. ET. (Expect Q3 GDP growth to be revised downward.) 2. News that the $54 Billion Shire-Abbvie deal was falling apart also weighed on stocks. 3. A September drop in PPI that had trading desks mentioning the dirty "D" word. (Deflation concerns — see the price of oil.) 4. A report on October manufacturing activity in New York that was poor too, slowing worse-than-expected after posting its strongest pace in nearly five years last month. 5. A second hospital worker contracted Ebola and flew in a plane recently. 6. The stock market in Greece came close to a full-blown crash. 7. ISIS. This isn't intended to be an exhaustive list. But it pretty much addresses every category of risk: economic slowdown, corporate profit slowdown, falling prices, geopolitical turmoil, and unknowns like Ebola. FREE AppDownload
