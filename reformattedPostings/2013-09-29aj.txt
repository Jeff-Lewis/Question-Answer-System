If Congress can't agree on a budget deal, then the government will "shut down" on Tuesday. Meanwhile, it's jobs week in America. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September employment situation report, which the Federal Reserve will watch closely as it considers its plan for tapering its stimulative large-scale asset purchase program. Unfortunately, there's a chance the jobs report will get cancelled. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary Investors are surprisingly sanguine considering the known unknowns. "We estimate that little or no volatility premium for the debt ceiling debates is priced into the options markets on stocks most exposed to government spending cuts," said Goldman Sachs' Robert Boroujerdi. "Complacency is even more pronounced on stocks with high government exposure," he added. "Fear priced into options on these stocks dropped over the past few months to new lows vs. SPX options."

"Investor apprehension about this market continues to increase," said JP Morgan's Tom Lee in reference to the latest leg of the stock market rally. "It is the combination of fears that this was a 'false breakout' to new highs coupled with lingering concerns about the budget/debt ceiling showdown in the US and the possible resulting turmoil." Lee thinks the S&amp;P 500 could end the year at 1,775.  FREE AppDownload
