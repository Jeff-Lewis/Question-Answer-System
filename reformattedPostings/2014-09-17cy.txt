Lahoud, 48, the architect behind the group's recent changes in governance limiting the influence of governments, is often seen as a potential high-flyer outside the group he helped to found and has repeatedly been linked in the press with Safran. But he sought to put a halt to the speculation through a statement from the group's chief spokesman on Twitter. "Good news for Airbus Group: Marwan Lahoud stays with us. He is no candidate for Safran CEO," Rainer Ohler, Airbus Group's head of corporate communications, said on his Twitter account.  (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by James Regan) FREE AppDownload
