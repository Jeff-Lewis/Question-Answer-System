When they make a hire, they look for folks who have a passion for the financial markets, embrace an entrepreneurial spirit and are self starters, are dedicated and hard-working, have the highest integrity, are confident yet humble, want to learn and grow, have intellectual curiosity and are team players and enjoy collaboration, the fund's website states. It looks like Wang certainly has that going for her.  Check out some photos of Wang doing her rhythmic gymnastics routines:  Getty Images/ Jeff Gross Getty Images/ Jeff Gross Getty Images/ Harry HowGetty Images/ Brian Bahr   FREE AppDownload
