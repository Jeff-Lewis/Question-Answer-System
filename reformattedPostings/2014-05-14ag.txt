As a renter, it’s easy to feel pressure to buy. Owning a home means you can start building equity and cash in on tax breaks. But in some parts of the country, it can take quite awhile to break even on a home purchase, making it more financially advantageous to rent for a few years. Based on Zillow’s breakeven horizon — the number of years it takes before owning a home makes more financial sense than renting the same home — here are the top 15 cities where renting rules. Breakeven horizon: 2.5 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,664Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 5 percent If you have the option to rent or buy the same San Jose home, renting could be a smart option because it takes 2.5 years for buying to be more financially advantageous. The median home value is currently $671,800, up 16.2 percent year-over-year. Rents have also increased but not as much, making it a great time to snag a rental. Breakeven horizon: 2.5 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,043Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 7 percent It’s also a great time to rent in Seattle if you don’t plan on owning the same home for more than 2.5 years. While home values aren’t appreciating quite as fast as in San Jose, they’re still seeing double-digit growth with a 10.3 percent increase since this time last year. Seattle’s median home value is currently $441,500. Breakeven horizon: 2.6 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,648Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 8.3 percent With the Zillow Rent Index up 8.3 percent year-over-year, Denver can feel pricey for renters. But for a couple of years, sending in a rent check each month could beat the costs associated with buying a home in the Mile High City. It currently takes 2.6 years for buying to make more financial sense than renting the same Denver home. Breakeven horizon: 2.8 yearsZillow Rent Index: $3,602Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 4.4 percent The San Francisco real estate market has seen double-digit growth over the past year, with the median home value up 15.1 percent. If you don’t plan on staying put for about three years, however, you’re better off renting and investing some of the money you could spend on a home purchase to earn interest elsewhere. Breakeven horizon: 2.8 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,254Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 1.5 percent Colorado Springs is a good place to rent if you aren’t ready to settle down for more than three years. The housing market is strong there, with the median home value up 4.5 percent year-over-year to $195,300. However it still takes 2.8 years for buying to beat renting. Breakeven horizon: 2.8 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,089Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 2.3 percent The Phoenix for-sale market is also strong with the median home value up 10.9 percent since this time last year. If you might move in the next 2.8 years, though, it makes more financial sense to rent than buy. The good news is the median rent is currently $1,089 — the lowest of any city on this list. Phoenix is the most affordable of the top cities for renters. Starting at $1,081, a 2-bedroom apartment in this complex comes with access to several community amenities including a pool, arcade room and volleyball court. Breakeven horizon: 2.8 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,149Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 3.2 percent Mesa, AZ rounds out the four-way tie for cities where renting beats buying if you plan on moving in the next 2.8 years. The median Mesa rent is currently $1,149 per month, while the Zillow Home Value Index is $172,500. Breakeven horizon: 3 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,491Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 3 percent The median Minneapolis rent increased 3 percent over the past 12 months, while the median home value is up 6 percent year-over-year. It takes three years to break even on a home purchase, making renting a favorable option for many residents. A median home costs around $187,800 to buy or $1,491 per month to rent. Breakeven horizon: 3.1 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,181Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 2.3 percent The Albuquerque market not only leans toward renting, but it’s also affordable for renters. It currently costs $1,181 per month to rent a median-priced home. The median home value, meanwhile, is $182,300 and expected to increase 2.3 percent by next year. Breakeven horizon: 3.2 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,192Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 4.3 percent Perhaps unsurprisingly, it also takes more than three years to break even on an real estate purchase in New York. If you want to try living in different parts of the city during that time, renting is a good option. You can expect a median rent of $2,192 per month. While on the pricey side, current market conditions have made renting in Boston or San Francisco equal to or more expensive than renting in the Big Apple. Breakeven horizon: 3.3 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,458Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 3.3 percent It makes more financial sense to rent than buy in Boston, unless you plan to stay put for at least 3.3 years. Either way, Boston is a hot market: The median home value rose 8.4 percent, and the median rent rose 3.3 percent over the past 12 months. Breakeven horizon: 3.5 yearsZillow Rent Index: $1,534Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 0.8 percent The median rent in Virginia Beach increased by only 0.8 percent year-over-year, which is great news for renters. The breakeven horizon there is 3.5 years, so you may be better off renting a home than buying for that time period. Breakeven horizon: 3.5 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,453Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 0.3 percent Washington, D.C., ties for the third best city for renting unless you plan to own a home for 3.5 years. The median rent is currently $2,453, a 0.3 percent increase since last year. The median home value is also up 14.4 percent to $454,900. Breakeven horizon: 4.2 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,223Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: 4.3 percent San Diego may see a few more sun worshipers choosing to pay month-to-month. With a breakeven horizon of 4.2 years, renting beats buying in the near-term. Existing homeowners are also seeingstrong market growth with the median home value up 12.3 percent year-over-year. Breakeven horizon: 6.8 yearsZillow Rent Index: $2,276Annual change in Zillow Rent Index: -5.4 percent In tropical paradise, renters rule. It takes 6.8 years to break even on a home purchase in Honolulu, sofinding a place to rent at or below the median rent of $2,276 is a smart move. In fact, the median rentis down more than 5 percent year-over-year, so now is a great time to sign the lease on your dream beach rental.
