PermanentTraveller / FlickrYokuzuno AsashoryuGood morning!  Japanese stocks got slammed in Tuesday trading, with the Nikkei falling 3%. This was the Nikkei's first trading day since Friday, meaning that the market was reacting to both the Friday jobs report in the US, and the US selloff on Monday, which saw the S&amp;P have its worst day of trading since August, losing 1.4%. The New Year has just begun, and attempts to read much into this action are almost certainly inadvisable. But so far, things haven't started off as well as 2013 ended. The data has been spottier and the market action has certainly been less pleasant. Meanwhile, European markets are also reacting to the weak US session, with the major indices down a bit less than 1%. FREE AppDownload
