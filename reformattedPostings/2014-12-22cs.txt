In October Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, said it had misstated its profits by 263 million pounds ($411 million), compounding a disastrous run of profit warnings. PwC were not immediately available for comment. The watchdog has powers to sanction accounting firms and their staff for failing to apply book-keeping rules properly.
