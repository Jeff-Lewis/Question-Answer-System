Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Vincent Reinhart published a brief note minutes after the U.S. government shutdown went into effect. "Dysfunction is not new, in that this marks the seventeenth shutdown in the past forty years," wrote Reinhart. "About 800,000 government workers will stay home, as federal employees who cannot be paid should not work." Here's the key takeaway from the note: In addition to finger pointing to assign blame, expect: "In the back-and-forth of legislative action, the ball is now in Speaker John Boehner’s court," added Reinhart. "The heat will build on politicians from constituents who were furloughed, inconvenienced, or fearful of market consequences. That is why we believe the odds favor a short event—over in one week."
