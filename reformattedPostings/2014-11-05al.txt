 Tesla just reported third-quarter earnings.  The electric car maker reported a small profit of $3 million which translates to roughly $0.02 per share of its stock. Analysts expected a loss of 1 cent per share, against a gain of 12 cents for the same period last year. Tesla stock is up almost 7.4% in after hours trading. All eyes are on Tesla sales. The company had expected to sell 35,000 cars worldwide and over 17,000 in the US in 2014. However, Tesla reported that 2014 sales would come in at 33,000, but that the company would still be able to manufacture 35,000 cars for the year. The gap of 2,000 vehicles is something Tesla had earlier indicated would show up in the third quarter. In other words, the company won't be able to deliver 2,000 of the cars it manufactured this year.  The issue of production and sales for 2014 being out of sync is something that Tesla has addressed.  It expects this issue to be resolved in 2015, as the company's plant in California adjusts to higher Model S production levels and the rollout of the Model X SUV, now expected to hit the market in the third quarter of 2015. Today's report is welcome news to Tesla's investors. There is immense pressure on the company to deli ever on all of the promise it has shone over the years. With share of its stock up a staggering 1,000% since its 2010 IPO, investors are clamoring to see the financial and sales figures that justify its stock value.

The Roadster established Tesla as a manufacturer of high performance electric cars and served as the company's halo product until the arrival of the Model S in 2012. Tesla is holding a call with analysts at 5:30 p.m. ET, so we should get some clarity on the sales issue from CEO Elon Musk.  Tesla MotorsThe original Tesla    FREE AppDownload
