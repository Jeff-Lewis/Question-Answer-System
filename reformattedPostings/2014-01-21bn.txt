The three stocks are helping pull the Dow down 132 points (and because the Dow is a price-weighted index, stocks with higher per-share prices jolt the index around more). The companies actually posted solid earnings, but have fallen this morning nonetheless. Travelers reported $2.68 earnings per share, better than the $2.16 estimate. The stock is trading down 2%. Verizon posted $0.66 EPS, beating the Wall Street consensus by a penny. It's trading down almost 2% also. Finally, Johnson &amp; Johnson beat earnings expectations by $0.04, but guided 2014 estimates toward the lower end of market expectations and is also down 2%. FREE AppDownload
