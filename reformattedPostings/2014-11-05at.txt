A private Princeton University eating club is being investigated by the university and local police after reports that a photo of two students performing a sex act — one that may be classified as sexual assault — was distributed through email among members, The Times of Trenton reports. According to The Times, local police began an investigation on Tuesday into Princeton's Tiger Inn eating club after details of the alleged photo appeared on a local blog, Planet Princeton. The university was already looking into the claims, Planet Princeton reported. "The Princeton University daily crime log on Tuesday listed a 'sexual assault' allegation reported on Monday evening having occurred on Oct. 10 at 48 Prospect Ave., which is the address of the Tiger Inn," The Times reports. However, the local Princeton police chief told The Times that "no victim has been identified and no witnesses have come forward in the alleged Oct. 10 incident." Without any confirmation of the photo or the alleged assault, it will be unlikely that the police can complete a full investigation. Planet Princeton has anonymous details about the alleged photo: An intoxicated first-year female student at Princeton University allegedly began performing oral sex on a senior on the dance floor at the private eating club, and someone allegedly snapped a photo of the act. An officer of the private eating club later allegedly distributed the photo to Tiger Inn members via email, some students claim. Tiger Inn was in the news earlier this year after their house was reportedly trashed by a secret society of Princeton students that gathers together the heaviest drinkers on campus for an annual drinking contest — 21 beers in 42 minutes.
