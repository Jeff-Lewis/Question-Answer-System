"Hearing from London contact of a major US fund rebalancing in gold. Chart below shows prior 10 days with 10-minute volume bar," says Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. "You can see this morning‘s heavy volume contrasts to the aftermath of the FOMC meeting of 9/18 when gold jumped." Thinkorswim FREE AppDownload
