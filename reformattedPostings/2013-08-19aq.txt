That suit was dismissed, but he won $1.3 million in arbitration, the Vanity Fair report said. He also filed a racial discrimination suit against the board of Upper West Side co-op The Dakota.  All that aside, his Connecticut home looks like something out of a fairy tale and we're going to take a tour.  FREE AppDownload
