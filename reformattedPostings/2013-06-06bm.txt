WikimediaAfter we published our piece on what's wrong with Chicago, Chicagoan Cody Kittle, an associate at PE firm Wind Point Partners, sent us the following response: Chicago no doubt has some big issues, as was illustrated by 25 Facts that Make Chicago the Most Depressing Big City in America and Author Rachel Shteir’s recent harangue in the New York Times Book Review.  Shteir’s review reads like she is surreptitiously seeking to settle a score from a “NY vs. Chicago” cocktail party conversation gone awry under the purview of a book review (it may take more than one read to realize, but she wrote a book review).  Shteir’s review comes off as bizarrely personal for commentary on something like the history of a city; herself admitting that Chicagoans' pride has “bugged me since I moved here from New York 13 years ago”.  What is unfortunate about Shtier’s piece is that she presents a handful of anecdotes and cherry picked statistics from a 60 year period as sufficient in justifying Chicago as a “poor” city worthy of pity.  In doing so she misses a very critical point: that the quality of life for the average person who has the option to choose what city they are in, i.e. the individual or family gainfully employed with a college degree, Chicago is actually wonderful to live in.
