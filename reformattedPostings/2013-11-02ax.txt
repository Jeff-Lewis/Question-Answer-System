WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Pirates hijacking ships off the Horn ofㅁfrica마ndSomalia맍rom 2005 to 2012 garnered well over a quarter of a billion U.S. dollars in ransom and used the money for criminal activities worldwide, according to a report released on Friday. The study reveals the pirates engaged in human trafficking arms trafficking, funding militias and money laundering through trade in the stimulant known as khat, particularly inKenya, as well as other illegal activities that divert money from the legal economy that would otherwise promote economic development. "Unchallenged piracy is not only a menace to stability and security, but it also has the power to corrupt the regional and international economy," saidStuart Yikona, a financial sector specialist at theWorld Bank마nd co-author of the report "Pirate Trails." It recommends a range of measures to combat the problem, including steps to deal with illegal cross-border cash smuggling, anti-money laundering measures and mechanisms to monitor financial flows through the khat trade. The study, conducted by theWorld Bank마nd theUnited Nation's Office of Drugs and Crimeand based on interviews with former pirates, government officials, bankers and others countering piracy, estimates that piracy costs the global economy $18 billion a year in increased trade costs. Attacks on ships off the coast ofSomalia마nd the Horn ofㅁfrica맟ielded between $339 million and $413 million in ransom money in the seven years from 2005, it said.
