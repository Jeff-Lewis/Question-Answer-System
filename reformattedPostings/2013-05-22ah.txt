Here's a geography question for you: What point on earth is the farthest from the center of the earth? Screengrab from YouTube The answer is actually not "the top of Mount Everest"--which was the answer that sprung into the mind of this 47-year old simpleton. I assumed that answer was too obvious to be correct, but I didn't have a better one. The good news is, if you had been competing in the National Geographic Bee like the 12-year old who just won it, the question would have been phrased in a way that made it clear that the answer wasn't Mount Everest: Because Earth bulges at the equator, the point that is farthest from Earth's center is the summit of a peak in Ecuador. Name this peak. Can you name that peak? Me, neither. But 12-year old Sathwik Karnik could. The answer is "Chimborazo." Wikipedia By getting that and many other questions right, Sathwik won the Bee, a $25,000 scholarship, a trip to the Galapagos, and a lifetime subscription to National Geographic.
