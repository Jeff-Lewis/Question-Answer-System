Sandy WeillFormer Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill is out to top his $88 million payday from the sale of his 15 Central Park West penthouse. He is now unloading his maid’s quarters in the posh building for more than six times what he paid in 2007. Weill slashed the $6.25 million ask for the property, which originally hit the market in January, to $5.65 million two weeks later. But that’s still well beyond the $980,000 he paid back in October of 2007 for the 1,079-square-foot pad. It’s also twice what a similar unit two floors up, slightly smaller and with no terrace, sold for in May. “Just think of how well ‘yeah, I spent $6 million to live in somebody’s old maids’ quarters’ is going to go over at the cocktail party,” one broker quipped to the New York Daily News. Still, the pad boasts a 111-square-foot terrace, a bedroom suite situated off the main vestibule, a marble bathroom and chef’s kitchen with top-of-the line appliances, according to the listing, which is in the hands of Brown Harris Stevens’ Kyle Blackmon. A spokesperson for the brokerage declined to comment to TRD on the listing. The taker will have plenty of high-profile neighbors, including Sting, Denzel Washington, Lloyd Blankfein and Russian oligarch Dimitry Rybolovlev, who picked up Weill’s pricey penthouse for his daughter.
