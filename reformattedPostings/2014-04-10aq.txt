Bloomberg.comiShares Biotechnology IndexThe stock market is selling off today, and once again it's being led down by the momentum stocks. One red-hot industry that continues to get smoked is biotechnology. The iShares Biotechnology Index (IBB) is down a whopping 6.1%. Among the big losers are Alexion Pharmaceuticals (-7.4%), Gilead Sciences (-6.8%), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (-6.1%). "I frankly just don't know why biotech is off so much today," said Mark Schoenebaum, a biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst for ISI Group. The IBB index is now down 19% from its February high. The industry has seen huge numbers of IPOs in the last year, which has some folks wondering if this is just the bursting of a bubble. Meanwhile, the industry analysts have generally remained bullish on the industry based on the long-term profit potential of drugs in the developmental and regulatory pipeline. "Large cap biotech is now trading at a 2015 and 2016 PE discount to the S&amp;P500!" exclaimed Credit Suisse's Ravi Mehrotra and Koon Ching in a recent note to clients. FREE AppDownload
