Stuart Wilson/Getty ImagesYou could look like this guy. 1. Have Patience"It'll take most guys about a month to grow out a full beard," says Olvera. Resist overshaping it in the early days until you can see what you've got going on. (Do use a trimmer to make sure the hairs are all even in length, though.) 2. Accept the ItchNew beard hairs can feel like "a cactus poking your skin" says Olvera, but the prickly sensation subsides after a week, so stay tough. "It helps to brush the hair so everything grows in the same direction." Try a Baxter of California Beard Comb. 3. Wash That Sh*tIt's hair, so you need to clean it or dirt can get trapped underneath. Olvera washes his beard in the shower every time he washes his hair, about twice a week. Try a gentle shampoo and conditioner, like those from Martial Vivot. 4. Soften It UpHair that's supple lays flat and won't scratch your girlfriend. "I use Dude No. 1 Beard Oil for a little bit of shine and to keep my skin underneath moisturized," says Olvera. 5. Avoid Hard LinesA beard shouldn't end at your chin. Someone tell the NFL. Let the hair grow naturally up to about an inch or two above your Adam's apple, then allow it to fade using a few different settings on a trimmer. (Olvera like's to use a trimmer from Oster.) 6. Shape Your FaceRound face? A more square beard can help define your jawline. "Everyone should aim to trim in tighter on the cheeks and leave hair a little longer where a goatee would be," says Olvera.  More from GQ This article originally appeared at GQ.com.  Copyright 2014.
