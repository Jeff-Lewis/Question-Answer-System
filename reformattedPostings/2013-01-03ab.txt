Earlier today we explained how more and more prominent and influential individuals are calling on The Treasury to avert the debt ceiling crisis by minting a trillion dollar coin. The Treasury, technically, can create platinum coins in any denomination. And so the theory is that rather than having a debt ceiling crisis, it would be better to have the Treasury deposit a trillion dollar platinum coin at the Federal Reserve, and have it credited to the government's bank account. Anyway, everyone's getting excited by it, and a petition has been launched at WhiteHouse.gov to get people to demand that Obama take this step. On Twitter, supporters are using the hashtag #mintthecoin to let their voices be heard. You can read our post here, which explains why there wouldn't be any severe ramifications.
