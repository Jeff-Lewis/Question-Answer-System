The Economist, traditionally a pro-capitalism, pro-business publication, is now blaming bankers for defaming the good name of capitalism. In a Saturday commentary about capitalism's increasingly negative reputation, the classical liberal magazine said that nearly half of Americans had a less-than-positive view of the term and associated it with financial capitalism and greedy banks. It's almost reminiscent of the 2011 OWS movement, which led protestors to occupy Zuccotti Park and other financial districts for months, denouncing big banks and the government's leniency toward them. While most people actually do like the underlying elements of capitalism — competition, private property — those things no longer come to mind when they think of capitalism, the article said. "In the past 30 years or so, capitalism has become associated less with businesses operating in a competitive market, and more with the banking sector. ... Financial capitalism is inherently less appealing. It produces not iPads, but complex structured products with obscure acronyms. And when governments and central banks are forced to step in to rescue the titans of finance, the idea of a free market also goes out the window. A system that privatises profits and nationalises losses is impossible to justify." Yup, that's The Economist. The same magazine that backed the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and endorsed, at various points, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. The same Economist whose conservative roots run so deep that it opposed providing food aid during the Irish Potato Famine, in which 1 million people starved to death. Now they're concerned that a general aversion to the idea of capitalism will lead voters to back harmful, anti-business politicians. And this, they say, is all the doing of the big bad guys on Wall Street: "Somehow, capitalism, for want of a better word, must be rescued from the bankers." Harsh. FREE AppDownload
