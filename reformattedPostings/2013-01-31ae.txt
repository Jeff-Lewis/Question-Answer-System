We see increasing signals of a sustained growth recovery in the coming months: the steady investment growth led by infrastructure projects, the improving labour market conditions boosting consumer spending, and the ongoing re-stocking process to lift production growth.” This contrasts with China's official PMI, which unexpectedly fell to 50.4, missing economists' expectation for a reading of 51.0.
