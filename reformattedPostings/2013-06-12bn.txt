Bloomberg reports that traders at some of the world's largest banks have been manipulating foreign-exchange rates by pushing through trades before the 60-second windows when the FX benchmarks are set. When traders receive a large, market-moving order from a client, they have their own positions to consider. Not to worry though. Bloomberg reports how the scheme works: One trader with more than a decade of experience said that if he received an order at 3:30 p.m. to sell 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in exchange for Swiss francs at the 4 p.m. fix, he would have two objectives: to sell his own euros at the highest price and also to move the rate lower so that at 4 p.m. he could buy the currency from his client at a lower price. He would profit from the difference between the reference rate and the higher price at which he sold his own euros, he said. A move in the benchmark of 2 basis points, or 0.02 percent, would be worth 200,000 francs ($216,000), he said. The practice — reportedly commonplace in the gently regulated, $4.7-trillion-a-day currency market — has been going on for at least a decade, according to the report. Though, the currency market is so monstrous that it would be fairly difficult for one trader to really make waves. And while some may call this practice rigging, others might say it's shrewd hedging.
