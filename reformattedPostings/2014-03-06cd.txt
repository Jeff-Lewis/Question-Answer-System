Interfax news agency cited Rustam Temurgaliyev, Crimea's vice premier, as saying: "All Ukrainian state enterprises will be nationalized and become the property of the Crimean autonomy." Hoping Moscow would let Crimea become part of Russia, he said: "We are ready to introduce the ruble zone." (Reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Editing by Timothy Heritage) FREE AppDownload
