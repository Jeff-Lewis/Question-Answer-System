JP Morgan FundsWe wrapped up 2013 the U.S. stock markets closing at an all-time high after booking a 30% return for the year. Gold had it's worst year in decades and the 20+ year bull market in bonds showed signs of ending. This all came with the Federal Reserve tapering back its monthly asset purchase program to $75 billion. And this came on the back of improving economic conditions in the U.S. Considering all of this, 2014 promises to be an interesting year in the U.S. and abroad. The emerging markets could be particularly volatile as the year is dotted with political landmines. To help navigate all of these considerations, David Kelly and the market strategy team at JP Morgan Asset Management just released their Q1 presentation on the state of the markets and the economy. Note: Thanks to J.P. Morgan Asset Management for giving us permission to feature this presentation.
