Flickr via nanoprobe67Good morning! It's another very quiet day in the markets. Around the world, there's almost no movement anywhere. Japanese stocks fell 0.14%. Germany is down 0.04%. US futures are basically flat. After some volatility last month, this has basically been the story, no real action anywhere. In the US, it's likely to be a quiet day, although the Producer Price Index comes out at 8:30, so those obsessed with the question of whether there's any inflation in the system should be watching that. It's unlikely to be a big market move, however. FREE AppDownload
