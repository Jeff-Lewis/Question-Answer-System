Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesIn March, 152,500 properties received a foreclosure filing in March.  This is according to RealtyTrac's latest report. This was down 1 percent from February and down 23 percent from a year ago.  But foreclosure starts – the pace at which mortgages enter the foreclosure process – were up 2 percent on the month to 71,113. New York saw the biggest surge in foreclosure starts up 200 percent year-over-year. Overall, 23 states saw foreclosure starts rise on a monthly basis, and 12 states posted an annual rise. While economists have been cranking up their home price forecasts this year, the rise in foreclosure starts is a trend to watch closely. "Although the overall national foreclosure trend continues to head lower, late-blooming foreclosures are bolting higher in some local markets where aggressive foreclosure prevention efforts in previous years are wearing off," said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac in a press release.  "Meanwhile, more recent foreclosure prevention efforts in other states have drastically increased the average time to foreclose, which could result in a similar outbreak of delayed foreclosures down the road in those states."
