The 51 new closing highs for the year are the most since 1995 and fourth most in history. * Equity markets will operate on a shortened trading schedule Wednesday, closing at 1 p.m. (1800 GMT) ahead of the Christmas Day holiday on Thursday. Volume is expected to be light, which could exacerbate volatility. * The benchmark S&amp;P index has risen 5.5 percent in its latest rally, its best 5-day run since December 2011, fueled by a commitment by the U.S. Federal Reserve last week to take a "patient" approach toward raising interest rates and solid economic data. * Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp &lt;8316.T&gt; will buy Citigroup Inc's &lt;c.n&gt; Japanese retail banking operations in October for about 40 billion yen ($330 million), people with knowledge of the matter said. * U.S. surgical implant maker Stryker Corp &lt;syk.n&gt; is planning a takeover offer for British medical device maker Smith &amp; Nephew &lt;sn.l&gt; that may come within weeks, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. U.S.-listed shares of Smith &amp; Nephew &lt;snn.n&gt; were down 3.5 percent to $36.70 in premarket. * European stocks were slightly higher in a shortened session ahead of the Christmas break, gaining ground for the seventh day in a row while Asian stocks gained in the wake of the U.S. GDP report.
