Recent rail trends have weakened substantially from very strong levels earlier this year.  The latest weekly reading came in at 3.3% year over year, but continues a trend of low single digit readings.  This latest data brings the 12 week average to 4.4%.  That’s still a healthy level, but well off the March high of 3.6%.  In this environment I guess any growth is good growth so this has to go down as a moderate positive for the economy even though the trend is negative.
