The announcement followed a reported disagreement over strategy with the central bank. Chief Executive Vitor Bento, Financial Director Joao Moreira Rato and Deputy Chief Executive Jose Honorio said in a joint statement they had communicated to the Bank of Portugal their intention to resign earlier this week "giving time to prepare a smooth transition to a new management team". "Our decision to resign is due to the fact that our mandate significantly changed since we began our roles, in mid-July. During our time at Novo Banco, we have contributed to the stabilization of the bank, taken steps to normalize operations and improve systems and launched a medium-term plan," they said.
