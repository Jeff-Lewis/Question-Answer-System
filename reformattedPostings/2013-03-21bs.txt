Tesla MotorsMarkit's March flash PMI report is out. The headline index of nationwide manufacturing conditions rose to 54.9 from February's 54.3 reading. Economists predicted a slightly smaller advance to 54.8. Any number over 50 on the index indicates expansive conditions, so today's reading suggests that the growth rate of manufacturing activity in the U.S. is accelerating. The headline index was led higher by an increase in the new orders sub-index, to 55.9 from 55.4, the new export orders sub-index, which rose to 51.2 from 48.5, and employment, which increased to 54.6 from 53.5. The total output sub-index fell to 56.8 from 57.3, indicating a slowing but still robust pace of expansion. Similarly, input and output prices continued to rise, but at a slowing pace.
