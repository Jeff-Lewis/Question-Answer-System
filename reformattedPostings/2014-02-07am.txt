Just in time for Valentine's Day, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is showing his love and appreciation for Apple CEO Tim Cook, and the $14 billion worth of stock the company just bought back. Icahn has been buying up Apple stock for months now, building a position, and he's been loud about how he thinks the company should be using its cash to buy back stock. Of course, that pumps up the stock price, and make shareholders (like him) wealthier. So of course, Icahn is happy about the $14 billion news, and tweeted as much Friday afternoon.   $GOOG @ 19x2014 est operating profit. At same multiple $AAPL=$1,245 per share. Ridiculous. Keep buying Tim! You still have $145 billion cash Icahn addressed that in a Tweet too (sort of). Tim Cook again confirms $AAPL will launch new products in new categories (plural) this year. Wall Street apparently still not listening. FREE AppDownload
