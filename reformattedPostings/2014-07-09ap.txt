ShutterstockThis post is sponsored by OppenheimerFunds.  The investing landscape is changing fast: Stock returns have risen at a torrid pace, and interest rates have reverted to previous lows. Meanwhile, activity in the global economy remains modest, at best. We want to hear from you about your current and future investment concerns. Are you wondering which stocks might do well in the "new" bull market? Waiting for interest rates to rise? Or worrying how larger economic forces might affect your portfolio? Vote in the polls below, and economist Brian Levitt will address the results in three videos we're producing with OppenheimerFunds. If you have a specific question related to one of these three topics, leave it in the comments, email it to expert@businessinsider.com, or tweet it with the hashtag #AskOppFundsExpert, and Levitt may respond in one of the videos.       Carefully consider fund investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Visit oppenheimerfunds.com, call your advisor or 1.800.225.5677 (CALL-OPP) for a prospectus with this and other fund information.
