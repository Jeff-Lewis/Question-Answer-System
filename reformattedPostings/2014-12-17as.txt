Wealth-X just announced its list of the biggest losers this year, proving that even the wealthiest hit rough patches.  Russian gas mogul Leonid Mikhelson lost the most, with over 40% of his fortune slipping away between Russia’s struggling economy and weak oil prices.  Here are the billionaires who lost the most in 2014: Mikhelson, CEO of Russian gas company Novatek, lost nearly 41% of his $17 billion fortune this year, leaving his current wealth at around $10 billion. His losses stem from a number of factors, including the decline of Russian currency, weak oil prices, and economic sanctions placed on Russia by Western nations in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  Though he remains the richest man in Japan, the CEO of SoftBank, Asia’s top Internet and telecommunications corporation, lost nearly $6 billion this year. Losses from Sprint, which SoftBank purchased last year, dragged down the company’s overall earnings this year. Chinese casinos struggled overall this year, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, which Woo owns, saw a 20% drop in revenue. Despite earning a strong $8.3 billion in 2013 as gambling surged last year, Woo ended this year with a $5.5 billion loss instead.  As Amazon shares shares continue to drop — down 28% in 2014 — Amazon is predicted to lose an estimated $40.5 million this year, according to Bloomberg. Bezos’s personal wealth took a $5.5 billion hit as well, but the founder remains confident in Amazon’s recovery.  It was a tough year for casino mogul Adelson, who is the CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. In addition to his personal monetary losses, hackers effectively shut down a major Las Vegas casino of Adelson’s in February, stealing customers’ Social Security Numbers and clearing hard drives. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions. FREE AppDownload
