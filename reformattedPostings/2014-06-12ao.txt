A call option is a contract that allows an investor to buy a stock at a set price at a future date. Today on Twitter, Joe Kunkle, founder of OptionsHawk.com, noted that activity in Keurig Green Mountain is again notable. Kunkle said that today, traders are buying $135 calls expiring in July.  Keurig Green Mountain has been one of the most controversial stocks in the market, and in the past has been a short idea of hedge fund manager David Einhorn.
