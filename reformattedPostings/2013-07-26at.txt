One might like to think FedEx employees make sure one's packages are handled with care in transit. The video below suggests otherwise.

FedEx sets high standards of behavior and performance for our team members and this behavior falls far short of what is expected.

We have already contacted the management personnel responsible for this employee and the appropriate corrective action will be taken."
