A dispute between Lufthansa and the union has resulted in repeated strikes at Lufthansa this year affecting thousands of passengers. Shares in Lufthansa have lost 15 percent of their value over the last three months due to the strikes as well as concerns over Ebola. "We are currently in talks with Lufthansa. During the talks we will not strike," Ilja Schulz, president of Vereiningung Cockpit, was quoted as telling Focus, according to an advance excerpt of its Monday edition. Vereinigung Cockpit could not immediately be reached for comment.  (Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Gareth Jones) FREE AppDownload
