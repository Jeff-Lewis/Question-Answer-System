For days Leopoldo Lopez, Venezuelan opposition leader and former Mayor of Caracas, has been wanted by the government for leading the student protests that have taken hold in cities all over the country for more than a week. Today, with the protestors still out in full force, Lopez turned himself in to Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez's successor. Check out this picture of Lopez saying goodbye to his wife, tweeted out by Venezuelan paper, El Nacional.

More and more people are taking to the streets (check out the masses in the picture below) and other opposition leaders are still on the loose. For example, the man who came close to beating Maduro in Venezuela's elections last year, Henrique Capriles, joined Lopez's protest today and is tweeting his support for Lopez. Capriles has also joined student protestors in demanding that the media end its censorship of the demonstrations and pay attention to their cause. They've been taking to social media to get the word out. Apparently, though, it's working. Anything that takes over the streets of Caracas like this is pretty hard to hide anyway (photo from Reuters). Reuters   FREE AppDownload
