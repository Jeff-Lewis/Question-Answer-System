JCPenney has expanded its borrowing capacity by $100 million, upping its total to $1.85 billion, Evan Clark at Women's Wear Daily reported. It's a nice little extra financial cushion as the department store chain attempts its transformative turnaround attempt under CEO Ron Johnson. JCPenney hasn't dipped into the facility yet. “As we enter the second year of our transformation, today’s announcement reflects the confidence of our banking group in our long-term strategy and further strengthens our liquidity position as we continue to execute our plan,” CFO Ken Hannah told WWD. Johnson addressed the issue in an interview on CNBC last week. "We'll do it with the cash we have on hand," said Johnson. "We've yet to tap into the revolver."  "Doesn't mean we wouldn't at some point, but we haven't done it in the first year," he continued. "We said we'd end the year with about a billion dollars in cash. In a couple weeks we tell people exactly where we ended up. Our teams did a great job managing our cash during this transformation."
