Kevin Krejci/FlickrThe S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price index for May climbed 12.17% year-over-year. This was just shy of expectations for a 12.4% year rise. Both the 10 and 20-city composites posted their biggest year-over-year gains since March 2006. On the month this was up 1.05%, below expectations for 1.4%. April's Case-Shiller was revised up to show a 1.73% MoM and 12.09% YoY rise. This is up from an initial reading of 1.72% MoM and a 12.05% YoY rise. "We will be paying particular attention to the breadth of  price gains in n3e.x5t week’s report. Since last December, all of the metropolitan areas surveyed have posted sequential increases in home selling prices," according to Societe Generale's Brian Jones. But not everyone was optimistic on the report. "Three straight months of national home value appreciation above 10 percent is not normal, not sustainable and, frankly, not very believable," said Zillow Senior Economist Svenja Gudell in an email. "As the overall housing market continues to improve, the impact of foreclosure re-sales on the Case-Shiller indices continues to be pronounced, as homes previously sold under duress trade again under more normal circumstances, leading to inflated and misleading markups in price." She thinks that home prices have appreciated at half the pace for the past few months, and that those numbers are "still very robust." Economists expect home price growth to slow in the second half of the year. Here's a look at the latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index chart: Case-Shiller FREE AppDownload
