The market is closed on Monday, but that doesn't mean you have to take a day off from your love of Wall Street (obviously). With you free time, catch up on the classics or maybe see something new. Either way, there are plenty of awesome movies (from Wall Street to Bonfire of the Vanities) to keep you in the Wall Street mindset. Check them out here, and then fire up your Netflix (if that's how you do it). FREE AppDownload
