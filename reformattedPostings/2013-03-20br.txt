Budgets continue be the center of debate in Washington, which is great, since we recently had Peter Orszag (Vice Chair at Citi and Obama's former OMB director) at Business Insider to discuss budgets. In this video, he explains the draconian nature of Paul Ryan's budget (even current spending trajectories are unrealistic in terms of how low we're forecasting spending) and the flawed assumptions behind it (that just by block granting money to the states to solve problems, they'll be able to find cost savings). He also argues that more stimulus is still justified in the short term, and that Democrats who oppose any long-term changes to entitlements are making it harder to make good policy in the short term.
