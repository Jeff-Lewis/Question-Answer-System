The blood-letting in the biotech sector continued today. The iShares Biotechnology Index (IBB) fell 2.8%. It's now down a whopping 16% since its Feb. 25 high. Here's how some of the individual names did today: These five stocks were among the ten worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 today. And yet, the S&amp;P 500 closed up for the day, which tells us something. According to Howard Silverblatt of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the market cap of the S&amp;P 500 Biotechnology industry was $404,312,608,997.80 at Thursday's market close. That may seem like a lot. But it's only 2.4% of the $16,494,076,158,127.40 market cap of the S&amp;P 500. In other words, you could wipe out the entire biotech sector and — all things being equal — you'd only lose 2.4% of the S&amp;P 500. Even at the height of 1999/2000 biotech bubble, the S&amp;P 500 Biotechs accounted for just 0.4% of the S&amp;P 500. "Bubbles pervade society," said Rich Bernstein to Business Insider in February. "They are bigger than the financial markets.  I don't think the biotech speculation is that broad, so no bubble in my opinion." We can debate about whether or not biotech stocks are in a bubble. But at the end of the day, those stocks only really concern biotech investors and prospective biotech investors. FREE AppDownload
