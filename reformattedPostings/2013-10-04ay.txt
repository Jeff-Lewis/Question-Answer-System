Screenshot via Bloomberg TVThe partial government shutdown meant no jobs report. And it would appear that some economists are taking this new worse than others. "Perhaps I'm just in denial mode. But I am seeing purple spots this morning, notheless (maybe being a Yankee fan in October and not seeing the pinstripes in action has exacerbated this condition," Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg wrote. Rosenberg took to lamenting the absence of this jobs report, by repurposing John Lennon. Here are the results: Imagine there's no payrollsIt's not easy if you tryNo jobs report below usIt's going to make me cryImagine all the economists seeing purple spots today  Imagine there's no dataIt's very hard to doNothing to write a report forAnd no market reaction tooImagine all the economists not gazing at their screens  You, you may sayI'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one I hope someday the BLS will join usAnd give the economists back their fun  Imagine no revisionsI wonder if you canNo need for the economists todayA number that deserves no banImagine all the economists, not sharing all their views  You, you may sayI'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only oneI hope someday the BLS will join usAnd give the economists back their fun. Rosenberg did however jot down what he would have written if there had been no shutdown. He would have seen a 215,000 increase nonfarm payrolls in September, above the estimate of 180,000. "While few economists saw this coming it had already been projected by the initial jobless claims data as the four-week moving average has fallen 20k in just the past month." Rosenberg also would have seen see a drop in unemployment rate to 7.1% because of employment gains and participation rate declines. That being said, he expects the Fed to maintain its "insanely accommodative stance into 2014."  We hope Congress and the White House can get their act together, if only to spare us such episodes.
