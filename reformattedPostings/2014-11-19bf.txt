Your hair and skin need more care now, so it's time to upgrade your morning routine. Insider Picks rounded up the essentials for great grooming that'll keep you looking your best. Instead of buying hundreds of disposable razors that will irritate and cut your skin, invest in one good razor (manual or electric). It'll save your skin some serious abuse.
