Oh WSO, how I've matured since I wrote this now infamous post that even made it to Business Insider and even elicited some pretty funny responses. Yeah, it was kind of a troll post, but maybe 10% of it had some element of meaningful substance — what is a hipster to do in the finance world? I guess now I'm qualified to tell you. These things don't matter at all once you're out of college. They matter even less if you work in IB. Now that I'm "living the dream" -- and trust me hardened WSO college kids, you're in for a rude awakening when you get there -- I haven't once thought about whether my self-proclaimed eclectic leanings have mattered in the workplace. Truth be told, there isn't time to think about much of anything beyond work and your longing for sleep...and yes, this includes your clothing, hairstyle, car, music you listen to, etc. Since starting my job, I haven't _once_ thought about how expensive my shoes are (they're not, but this is beside the point), how nice my suit is, whether my tie is Hermes or any of that other nonsense that pops up on WSO seemingly 15 times a day. These things do not matter. I wish I could tell you that hipsters fit like a square peg in a square hole in finance, but honestly I don't know the answer to this question because it matters so little. All anyone cares is if you suck at your job, and if you do, having pledged 17 different fraternities in college (or conversely having a playlist of only-Pitchfork-rated albums) isn't gonna save you. Neither will your suit, or your Allen Edmonds Park Avenues, or the fact that you think you're hot stuff because you went to a target school.
