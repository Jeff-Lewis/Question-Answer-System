For the first time, a laser weapon system (LaWS) was successfully operated aboard a US Navy ship. A demonstration of LaWS took place in November aboard the USS Ponce while it was deployed to the Arabian Gulf. It struck targets aboard a small speeding boat, shot down an unmanned drone and destroyed other moving targets.
