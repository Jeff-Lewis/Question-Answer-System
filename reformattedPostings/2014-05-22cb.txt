This comes after a series of Flash PMI reports, which revealed that Germany continues to grow at a healthy pace as France slipped into contraction. Asian markets closed in the green with Japan's Nikkei up 2.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.5%. Overnight, we learned that China's Flash PMI climbed to a 5-month high of 49.7 in May, beating expectations for a 48.3 print. "The HSBC Chinese PMI has bounced and given markets a better feel this morning," said Societe Generale's Kit Juckes.
