The action, announced on Thursday night, involves some of the nearly 1,000,000 cars previously included in a June recall, and a portion of the 560,000 cars recalled in April 2013. Honda did not provide an exact total. Honda said no injuries or fatalities related to the issue have been confirmed. Honda said U.S. dealers will replace the passenger side air bag inflator, which can rupture and send metal shards into the passenger compartment. At least four deaths have been linked to the defect.
