Here's a day you have to circle in your calendar: March 1, 2013. Make sure you pre-block off all of your other social engagements, because you're going to want to be around a computer and a TV. First, that's the day that the "sequestration" (mandatory spending cuts) go into effect.

Congress will need to raise the debt limit by that point if it has not already. While a failure to raise the debt limit should not have implications for the Treasury's ability to make interest payments or to redeem existing securities, it could lead to a sharp reduction in spending, including fiscal transfers to individuals, payments to contractors, and payment of tax refunds which tend to be fairly heavy during this period.   The clock is ticking.
