AP Photo Jefferies analysts Laban Yu and Jack Lu argue in a note today that China's epic air pollution is actually saving lives. Wait what? Here's their case: Yes, of course China's smog problems are very real — they lead the world in premature deaths caused by air pollution: Jefferies But this massive pollution is actually a sign of rising living standards, they write: The difference is that industrialization – with its incumbent air pollution – eliminates poverty. Among the top twenty nations with air pollution induced premature deaths are the US, Japan, the UK, Germany and Italy – all wealthy developed nations. As it turns out, more people die prematurely in India from problems caused by a lacked of advanced infrastructure like diarrhea and poor ventilation or burning of coal and animal dung for heat (which they categorize as "indoor air pollution"): Jefferies But a better measure of China's standing on public health is illness, disability and early death (DALY), a metric created by the World Health Organization. By that criteria, China is not even in the top 20 —  Jefferies And only a few notches behind Brazil: Jefferies Yu and Lu point out that China's air pollution is the fruit of industrialization, and that industrialization is a life saver. The public health effects of air pollution cannot be viewed in isolation. Nobody believes air pollution is a great thing but nations continue to pollute because civilizations make hard choices. And air pollution is not even that hard a choice. Higher cancer rates in old age are the price that China, and many other nations, have chosen to pay for lower death rates from childhood diarrhea.  SEE MORE: Stunning Photos Of The Energy Of The Future &gt; FREE AppDownload
