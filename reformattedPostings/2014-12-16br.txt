And now gold is getting in the mix. In morning trade on Tuesday, amid a turbulent day in global markets, the price of gold was tumbling. Near 11 a.m. ET, gold was down to about $1,188 an ounce, about $30 an ounce lower than it was earlier Tuesday morning. Among the other big decliners Tuesday was the Russian ruble, collapsing for the second day in a row to as low as 79 against the US dollar. This latest collapse in the ruble comes after the Russian central bank on Monday night unexpectedly raised interest rates by 6.5%.  Oil was also tumbling, with WTI crude falling below $54 a barrel and Brent crude falling below $59.  And so gold's tumble was on a bit of a delay relative to some other volatile assets, but better late than never.
