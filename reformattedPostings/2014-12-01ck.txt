Thomson ReutersA street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New YorkBy Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Monday as manufacturing growth across Asia and Europe eased in November, with demand waning even in the face of sharp price cuts. Sliding oil and metals prices are seen dragging on energy and mining stocks. The Select Sector SPDR Energy exchange traded fund  fell 1 percent in light premarket trading. U.S. crude futures  fell 1 percent to $65.52 a barrel and Brent  dropped 0.7 percent to $69.68. Markit's final November manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 50.1, its lowest reading since June 2013 and down from a flash reading in mid-November of 50.4, despite price cuts made possible by tumbling input costs. New orders declined for a third month. U.S. manufacturing data is due later in the day, with Markit's gauge out at 9:45 a.m. (1445 GMT), followed soon after by the Institute for Supply Management's report. Early holiday promotions and rising online shopping took a toll on in-store U.S. sales during the Thanksgiving weekend as shoppers on average spent 6.4 percent less than they did a year earlier, according to data released Sunday by an industry group.
