The ruble is collapsing. Russia's currency fell to new lows, touching nearly 80 rubles to the dollar and over 100 rubles to the euro on Tuesday.  Earlier on Tuesday, the ruble opened 8% stronger after Russia's central bank raised rates by 650 basis points to 17% from 10.5%, at 1 a.m. local time Tuesday morning.  In a worrying sign for the Bank of Russia, the currency remains volatile, quickly reversing the morning's gains and snapping back to move over 13% weaker from its opening price. It is now down by more than 20% over the week and down by 56% year to date. Bloomberg.com To compound the country's woes, Russia's 10-year local bond yield (the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow) jumped more than 2% to 15.36%, while the country's dollar-denominated 10-year bond yield also leaped up 36 basis points to 7.55%, the Financial Times reports.  Heinz Rüttimann, an emerging-market strategist at Julius Baer, describes the situation as a "perfect storm" for Russia, the final step of which would be the introduction of capital controls or a move to stop money already in Russia from leaving the country.  The collapse in the ruble has set off chaos in markets around the world, with US stock futures falling, oil continuing to collapse, US Treasury bonds rallying, and other currencies — notably the Norwegian krone — also tumbling.   FREE AppDownload
