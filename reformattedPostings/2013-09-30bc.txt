APSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is floating a proposal that would, essentially, reset the shot clock on a government shutdown by a week.  McConnell's plan would fund the government for one more week, which would give the parties another week to work out their differences and come to agreement on a long term continuing resolution that keeps the government funded. But the idea was quickly shot down by top Senate Democratic offices. One senior Democratic Senate aide called it a "non-starter." The House probably wouldn't pass it, the aide said, because it wouldn't earn enough support from House conservatives or Democrats who want a longer-term "clean" CR to pass.  And besides that, the bill currently being debated would only fund the government through Nov. 15. "A week would change nothing. The bill we are discussing is only 6-weeks long to begin with!!!" the aide said. The government will shut down Tuesday if Congress does not agree on a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. On Monday afternoon, the Senate voted immediately to table both House-passed amendments to the CR that significantly chip away at the Affordable Care Act. The Senate Democratic aide also questioned why McConnell floated the idea to begin with, saying that House Republicans were "already dumping all over it" and conservative groups were shooting the idea down.
