The meltdown in yields is attributable to the meltdown in the Eurozone’s inflation rate, which is somewhat worrisome if it turns into deflation. On Friday, February's flash CPI for the region was up 0.8% y/y, unchanged from the month before. That’s well below the ECB's target of 2% and within the “danger zone” of below 1% as defined by the bank's president, Mario Draghi. This inflation rate was 2.7% two years ago and 1.8% a year ago. Yesterday, we learned that the Eurozone's M-PMI dipped from 54.0 during January to 53.2 last month. That’s still a solid reading. Germany's dipped but was at 54.8, and even Italy's (52.3) and Spain's (52.5) remained above 50. Ed Yardeni Today's Morning Briefing: Cold War II.
