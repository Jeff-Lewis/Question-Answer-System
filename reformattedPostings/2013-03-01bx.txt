When you first start in banking, you're pretty much stuck. I wouldn't risk the political capital and references for buyside to do any of the tongue-in-cheek tips I'm going to recommend below. Just pay your dues and get used to having your weekends ruined. However, once you secure an offer or you're in your second year, here are some tips to salvaging your weekend (yes it also works on the buyside). 1. Make sure you have a list rehearsed on what you have going on this weekend. Most likely someone is going to ask you what you have going on this weekend. Instead of saying "Oh I was going to grab dinner with friends" you should just rattle off your work list and then interrupt yourself by saying "Oh that reminds me, I have to go check something" 2. Run around all afternoon to look busy. Don't be the idiot standing by the chill table talking to associates/vps because that's where your boss / staffer is going to go first to drop a new deal / pitch on you. One associate in banking used to chill by the "fun" table whenever he had a staffing and wanted to scope out which analysts were free. 3. Do not grab lunch with others on Friday. It makes you look like you're free. Spend the time at your desk or eat at your desk. This also helps you finish up work faster whether you're busy or not. 4. Actually do work. Try to make Fridays your most productive day. It can be hard when people are in a good mood and talkative, but you want to be grinding away in the morning/afternoon. Even consider coming in early on Fridays so you can guarantee you're all finished by evening.
