REUTERS/Jonanthan ErnstThe billionaires George Soros and James Simons.Forbes has released its annual "Richest People In America List."  The Forbes 400 always includes the biggest names in the hedge fund space. We counted 30 hedge fund managers this year. Fund managers like Daniel Loeb of Third Point and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square have both seen their net-worth increase significantly in the past year. Steve Cohen also saw a $1 billion jump in his personal fortune.  The 84-year-old George Soros is still king, though, with an estimated net-worth of $24 billion. On the flip side, numerous billionaire fund managers in the US didn't make the cut. Folks like Baupost Group's Seth Klarman and Discovery Capital's Rob Citrone, who are worth 10 figures, weren't quite rich enough.  FREE AppDownload
