GAAP net loss for the period was $173,000, or ($0.00) per basic share. MakerBot branded products and services contributed $33.6 million to second quarter revenue, driven by channel expansion initiatives and the successful introductions of new products within the rapidly expanding segment for desktop 3D printers. The company raised its financial guidance for fiscal 2014 to account for an improved outlook for the remainder of the year, as well as to account for the recent acquisitions of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies. The company raised its organic revenue growth forecast for 2014 to at least 30%, versus a previous forecast of at least 25%.

Q2-2014 Financial Results Summary: "We continue to observe strong positive sales momentum for our higher-performance systems and materials, which is reflected in the impressive 35% organic revenue growth we generated during the second quarter," said David Reis, chief executive officer of Stratasys. "Equally impressive were the sales of MakerBot products and services, which contributed $33.6 million of revenue during the period, driven by our expanding distribution network and the successful launch of three MakerBot branded 3D printers in the first half of the year. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which represent quarterly records in revenue, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share." Recent Business Highlights: "We expect our positive momentum to continue as we begin the second half of 2014," continued Reis. "Reflecting our favorable outlook, we are increasing our projection for organic revenue growth in 2014 to at least 30%, and we are raising our financial guidance accordingly. In addition, we are adjusting our outlook to account for the recent acquisitions of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, acquisitions that we now believe will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2014. Longer term, we believe these acquisitions will enable us to better serve our customers, ultimately providing synergies for our combined organization. We are excited about our many opportunities, and believe we are well positioned within our rapidly growing industry."
