Justing Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe March reading of new home sales is out. The headline number climbed 1.5% to an annualized rated of 417k. Economists were looking for a 1.2% increase to a level of 416k. The discrepancy in the numbers comes from the fact that last month's 4.6% drop was down to a 7.6% drop. "The median sales price of new houses sold in March 2013 was $247,000; the average sales price was $279,900," added the Census. "The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of March was 153,000. This represents a supply of 4.4 months at the current sales rate." "The drop in sales in February was probably at least partly reversed," said Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics in a note yesterday. FREE AppDownload
