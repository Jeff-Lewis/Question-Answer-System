Bloomberg has a new profile of Cohen, the hyper-private chairman of C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, described as "the biggest company no one has ever heard of." Fittingly, Cohen was not interviewed for the piece (he hasn't done an interview in a decade). The epitome of stealth, he even keeps the company's delivery trucks unmarked.
