Meanwhile, Burger King and KFC have suffered the most.  Morgan Stanley Other losers include casual dining restaurants like Outback and Red Lobster.  Despite an overall decline in the fast food industry, McDonald's has managed to gain customers.  The burger chain also remains the most popular restaurant in America, as evidenced by the chart below.  Morgan Stanley More than half of adults have visited McDonald's in the past 6 months.  The next popular restaurant was Subway, with 34% of adults visiting one of the sandwich chain's locations.  FREE AppDownload
