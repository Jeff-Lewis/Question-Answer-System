aldenjewell / Flickr2012 was a great year for U.S. auto sales. Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas think 2013 will be even better.  From his note to clients: We expect recent strong SAAR momentum to continue.Together with Sandy replacement, fleet restocking and a housing led credit expansion, this should drive the SAAR higher to 16 mm in 2013 above our prior 15.5 mm est. and +10% vs.14.5 mm in 2012. We see 2013 NA production up 4% y/y to 16 mm. The main drivers of the higher SAAR include: 1.    Strong exit rate for 2012 despite headwinds. The SAAR exited 2012 with a 4Q run rate of 15.1 mm, including mid-15 mm reports in Nov and Dec. despite macro uncertainty. 2.    Sandy replacement demand. As per NADA estimates, Hurricane Sandy destroyed up to 200-250k cars in the Northeast region. This would represent nearly 1 out of 1000 cars in the entire country and include cars of various vintages. 3.    Fleet restocking. In 2H12, fleet sales fell sharply, partly reflecting seasonality and partly reflecting strong retail demand. As fleet sales adjust to stronger overall SAAR / macro levels (fleet is typically 20% of SAAR) we expect a strong fleet rebound in 1Q. 4.    Credit availability. Our credit availability index has risen for the last 6 months. Anecdotal feedback from OEMs and dealers also points to significantly improved credit availability, esp. with subprime customers and expansion of leasing.
