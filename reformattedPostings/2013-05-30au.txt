Google MapsThe co-op at 953 Fifth Avenue that belonged to Robert McKeon, the founder and chairman of private equity firm Veritas Capital who killed himself last year, has hit the market for $11.5 million, StreetEasy shows. Jed Garfield and Matthew Pravda of Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Co. have the listing for the four-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom renovated duplex. McKeon’s death at 58 made headlines when it was ruled a suicide. He died of asphyxia in September 2012 at his home in Darien, Conn., press reports show. He purchased the co-op in November 2006 for $7.3 million, according to city property records. The brief listing said the apartment includes working fireplaces and offers “both views and sophistication.” McKeon’s family recently unloaded his Hamptons estate to fellow financial mogul Steven Cohen, the founder of hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Cohen — who is currently listing his home at One Beacon Court for $115 million — paid $60 million for the spread on Further Lane in East Hamptons, as previously reported. McKeon’s three-acre Connecticut estate is reportedly worth $5 million, and includes five bedrooms and six bathrooms. The late financier owned another home in ski town Telluride, Colo., the Daily Mail reported. A native of the Bronx, McKeon founded Veritas in 1992. He was previously chairman and a founding partner at investment bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Garfield and Pravda did not immediately respond to requests for comment. FREE AppDownload
