REUTERS/Brendan McDermidSpecialist trader Chris Malloy (C) gives a price to traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, October 18, 2013. In retrospect, it was a good idea to buy Amazon stock the day it went public. If you had invested $1,000 in Jeff Bezos' company then, you'd have earned $239,045 by now. It went public 16 years ago at $18 per share. Now Amazon is trading at $358 per share. How much money would you have made on eBay, Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn or Facebook's IPOs if you'd invested $1,000? Mashable and Statista figured it out.  Nothing beats an early $1,000 investment in Amazon, but if you had invested $1,000 in eBay the day it went public, you'd have almost $70,000 more now. If you had put the same amount in Yahoo, you'd have just over $60,000 more. An early $1,000 investment in Google would net you $12,072. LinkedIn's IPO would have given you about $5,000 by now. Facebook's would have you up, but only by about $1,300. Head over to Mashable to see the chart, which has been adjusted for splits and dividends. FREE AppDownload
