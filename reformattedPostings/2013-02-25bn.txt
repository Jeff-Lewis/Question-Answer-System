ApEconomic forecasters expect the budget cuts of the sequester and other looming political battles to hold back GDP growth to 2.4 percent in 2013, according to a survey published Monday by the National Association for Business Economics. And about 60 percent of the panelists said they expected the sequester's cuts to occur, either partially or in full, as they are set to begin kicking in this week. A whopping 95 percent of the 49 economic forecasters who participated in the NABE survey said they expected that GDP growth would be negatively affected by the "uncertainty" to come with fights over the sequester, continuing resolution, and the debt ceiling.

House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, is holding a press conference later today. FREE AppDownload
