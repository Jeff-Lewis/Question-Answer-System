PandoHenry Blodget and Pando CEO Sarah LacyThe folks at technology site Pando were kind enough to ask me to be their guest at this month's PandoMonthly evening event. The format of these events is unusual: Food, booze, and a two-hour grilling of a single interview subject. It's a privilege to have people listen to anything you have to say, let alone two hours worth of what you have to say, so I'm grateful to the Pando team and to everyone who attended. Pando CEO Sarah Lacy asked me about pretty much everything, including: One Twitter viewer described the interview as "ferociously frank."  The folks at Pando saw a resemblance to Louis CK (which may be the highest compliment I've ever received.)  If you've got two hours, you can watch the whole thing below. Or you can head over to Pando, where they've broken out lots of clips.  FREE AppDownload
