Rumours are circling that Wall Street's least favorite politician could get a promotion today, says Politico's Manu Raju and John Bresnahan. Senate minority leader Harry Reid (NV) is in private talks with Elizabeth Warren ahead of closed-door leadership elections set for this afternoon.

It could also signal a shift toward heightened partisanship, Politico reported. We'll find out. FREE AppDownload
