Reuters/ Phil McCarten T. Boone Pickens.It's billionaire oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens' birthday today. The 86-year-old certainly has a way with words and a knack for telling it like it is. He's known for engaging with hip-hop stars like Drake and Dr. Dre on Twitter about becoming billionaires. The author of "The First Billion Is The Hardest" has a ton of catchy/easy to remember phrases about life and business. They're affectionately referred to by his family and staff members as "Boone-isms."  We've compiled some of his business Boone-isms in the slides that follow from his website boonepickens.com. Some of these verbal gems are first seen on his Twitter account @BoonePickens.  FREE AppDownload
