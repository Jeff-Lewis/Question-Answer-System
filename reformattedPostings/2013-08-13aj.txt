Smallville WikiaCNN host Brian Stelter was kind enough to have me on his show, "Reliable Sources," over the weekend. In response to one question, I said that journalism has entered a "golden age."  Judging from the Twitter reaction, many of Brian's viewers agreed.  One viewer, however, a former print journalist, called this assertion "absurd." It's true that "golden age for journalism" is not usually the first thing that you hear when you go to conferences and listen to panels of middle-aged newspaper people talk about the state of the newspaper business. But I wasn't talking about the newspaper business. I was talking about journalism. And what I was suggesting is that — far from the picture of unremitting gloom occasionally painted by newspaper folks — journalism is now in better shape than it has ever been. Consider: I could go on. But you get the picture. The business of journalism is changing, certainly, especially at newspapers. You can't have change without loss. And loss is often painful and disruptive. But journalism itself is entering a new golden age. And, contrary to the assertions of some newspaper owners, even the journalism business is going to be okay. In fact, when some of today's upstart digital news organizations have matured, and the transformation of the newspaper business is complete, the journalism business is not just going to be okay. It's going to be excellent. All we have to do is get through this tumultuous transition period. In the meantime, journalism itself has never been in better shape. FREE AppDownload
