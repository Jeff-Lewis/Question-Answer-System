Activist investor Bill Ackman and billionaire investor Carl Icahn just squared off in the best moment in financial television on CNBC's "Half Time Report". The epic feud between these two titans goes back a decade, to when Ackman was running his former hedge fund Gotham Partners.  In short, they did a deal together and it ended up going to court with Ackman winning. Today, Icahn, who was dropping curse words left and right on live TV, was full of insults for Ackman. He even had a few for host Scott Wapner, who was basically a referee today.  We noticed that Ackman held his composure during the segment.  He didn't throw around curse words or mean insults.  He mostly just called Icahn dishonest. Anyway, here's a round up of some of the little gems that came from Icahn's mouth today. ON WHEN ACKMAN CALLED HIM IN 2003: ON ACKMAN AS A FRIEND:   ON HAVING DINNER WITH ACKMAN:   ON ACKMAN DONATING ANY HLF PROFITS TO CHARITY:  ON ACKMAN SAYING ICAHN IS A GOOD INVESTOR:  **BONUS: ON WHEN SCOTT WAPNER ASKED HIM IF HE'S LONG HLF:   It was entertaining to say the least.  For the full roundup, see here &gt; SEE: The 16 Nastiest Financial Feuds &gt; FREE AppDownload
