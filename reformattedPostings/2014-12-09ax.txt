Many of us have experienced the following situation at a big-box store: You're trying to find an item, but store workers are assisting other customers or are nowhere to be found, so you end up walking around endlessly from aisle to aisle. Lowe's is trying to improve the customer experience by testing robotic "employees" at Orchard Supply Hardware in San Jose, California. The OSHbots — named after their new place of employment — have the ability to locate products and lead customers to their location throughout the store. Lowe's, Orchard Supply's parent company, is focused on infusing more technology into its customer service in the near future. Produced by Alex Kuzoian. Video courtesy of Associated Press.
