In a new investigative report, The Guardian's Abigail Haworth takes a dive into the sexual travails of young people in Japan, asking (as the headline suggests), "Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex?" The article itself is a worth a read. It has some interesting anecdotes, but the overarching point — that Japanese youths simply "can't be bothered with sex" anymore — spurred New York Times reporter Hiroko Tabuchi to launch an old-fashioned, chart-based tweet missive.  "C'mon guys, it's simply not true that Japanese aren't having sex. In 2010, ~90% of both <U+2642><U+2640> had sex by early/mid 20s," she tweeted (the link to this chart). It's in Japanese, but it's not hard to figure out that the y-column is the percentage of survey respondents who have had sex, and the x column is age.

Yes but so does US (164m pet dogs+cats vs 74m &lt;18yos) It's the norm in many countries. "Finally: % of single Japanese women who see benefits of single life <U+2193>since 1987 while % seeing benefits of marriage <U+2191>," she tweeted along with this: Twitter.com/HirokoTabuchi FREE AppDownload
