Monday’s FT included an article titled, “Wall of money eases Eurozone funding.” The print version of the same story yesterday was titled, "Eurozone makes hay while bond market shines.” It notes: “Encouraged by low market borrowing costs and strong investor demand, finance ministries are further ahead in funding programmes than at this stage in at least the past three years. France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands have raised more than half the year’s expected total, according to estimates by Barclays." That’s even though the region is in the worst recession since the monetary union started in 1999. Investors are clearly reaching for yield all around the world, including in the peripheral countries of the euro zone. The FT reports: “When Spain last week issued 10-year bonds, demand was three times greater than the €7bn raised. Italy raised €6bn from 30-year bonds, the first with such a long maturity since 2009. Earlier this month, Portugal issued €3bn of new 10-year bonds, its first since the country requested an international bailout programme two years ago.” Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Group Hug.
