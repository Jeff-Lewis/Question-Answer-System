Credit SuisseCredit Suisse Global Equity Strategist Andrew Garthwaite and his team are taking a bit of stock market exposure off the table after the recent run-up in the S&amp;P 500 over the past month. Garthwaite warns clients in a new research note out this morning, "Many of our tactical indicators point to a consolidation phase in the equity markets, in the near-term." In the note, Garthwaite highlights nine charts that show how, just as the stock market has taken a turn upward since mid-November, investor sentiment toward stocks has soared higher in that short amount of time. Many of the charts show sentiment indicators now at multi-year highs, suggesting elevated risk of a market selloff. Thanks to Credit Suisse for giving us permssion to feature these charts.
