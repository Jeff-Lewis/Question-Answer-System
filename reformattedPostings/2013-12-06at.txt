flickr/fanofretailOnce booming sandwich chain Quiznos started running into trouble during the recession, and things have only gotten worse. In 2012, the company restructured its debt in order to avoid bankruptcy and fund a turnaround, but the plan hasn't worked. Now it has missed a loan payment, is attempting to restructure its debt again, and has franchisees worried and angry, according to The Wall Street Journal. In this time, Quiznos has gone from nearly 5,000 stores to around 2,100, and hundreds more US stores are underperforming and may close, according to the Journal. Meanwhile similar chains have done just fine. Chicago-based Potbelly is rapidly expanding and recently had a very successful initial public offering. Jimmy John's is expanding too, and Subway continues to be a growing and highly profitable behemoth. Here's what went wrong with Quiznos: The company's creditors already took a large hit last year, writing down over a third of the company's debt. They may not be so forgiving this time.
