Revenue is likely to be in a range of T$65 billion ($2.16 billion) to T$70 billion, compared with T$70.67 billion in the same period a year prior, Chief Financial Officer Chialin Chang said at a quarterly investor conference. Chang said the manufacturer expects a second-quarter gross profit margin of 21.3 percent to 22 percent, and earnings-per-share of T$2.21 to T$3. HTC is likely to break even or book a profit in the first half, Chang said, after reporting a loss in January-March that was wider than analysts estimated at T$1.88 billion.
