Last week, we told you about Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander's exclusive new wine club in the Hamptons. Now we have pictures of the 10,000-square-foot Société du Vin, which is currently accepting members for $50,000 a pop. What once was an old potato barn in Bridgehampton now looks like something from a movie thanks to Hollywood set director Elvis Restaino. Joseph &amp; Curtis, a wine cellar design company, interviewed Alexander about the project and shared some pictures as well. Check them out below.
