Two days ago there was some strange trading activity before the May Consumer Confidence number came out. There was an explosion in SPY (the SPDR Sector S&amp;P ETF), the eMini (electronically traded futures) and hundreds of other stocks 1/4 second before the number came out. In trading time, that's forever. Eric Hunsader the CEO of market research firm Nanex, told Business Insider that the strange activity was most likely a case of 'banging the beehive.' That's the phrase traders use to describe what happens when a high frequency trader sends out a barrage of orders before right before a key event (like a report), impacting price and forcing everyone in the market to move their positions. It's wild stuff, and seeing it in action is even wilder. Today, Nanex posted a video of trading in the SPY ahead of the Consumer Confidence number. You can check it out below. It shows a half second before the 10:00 am announcement, slowed down for 5:39. You'll note activity explodes at 9:59:59.755. Also, just FYI, the little colorful bars are exchanges.
