Walgreen said on Wednesday it would buy the 55 percent it does not already own of Alliance Boots for 3.13 billion pounds ($5.27 billion) in cash and 144.3 million Walgreen shares, after first taking a 45 percent stake in 2012. It added the combined company would keep its tax domicile in the United States, with headquarters in the Chicago area. The announcement from Walgreen follows news Tuesday that the Obama administration is reviewing its options in attempts to stop companies from moving their tax base abroad.  In pre-market trade, shares of Walgreens were down more than 10%.  (Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Mark Potter) FREE AppDownload
