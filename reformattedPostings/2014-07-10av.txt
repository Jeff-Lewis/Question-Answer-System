ReutersCNBC host Marcus Lemonis and a group of investors are nearing a deal to buy Crumbs Bake Shop, CNBC is reporting. News of the potential deal sent the stock soaring more than 1600% to 52 cents per share on Thursday afternoon. “The company has limited cash, and we are trying to come up with a situation that allows the company to remain viable,” Lemonis told the Los Angeles Times. “We are in the final stages of working on a plan to get the stores reopened and people rehired.” Crumbs closed all of its stores Monday after years of sales declines. The closures came one week after the company's shares were delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange. Lemonis is the chairman and CEO of Camping World and Good Sam Enterprises and star of CNBC's "The Profit," in which he provides financing to struggling businesses to help them execute a turnaround. The group of investors also includes the Fischer family, who own Dippin' Dots.  Crumbs CEO and General Counsel Edward Slezak confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that the company was considering restructuring options. "We know that everyone has an emotional connection to the Crumbs brand and its products, and we're pleased to be in talks with various interested parties that are allowing us to pursue all of our options for the business, which includes consideration of restructuring alternatives," Slezak told the Journal. Crumbs was founded in 2003 with a single bakery in Manhattan's Upper West Side and eventually expanded to 79 stores across the country. Roughly 800 full- and part-time workers were laid off as a result of the store closures. FREE AppDownload
