REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst A corridor is marked closed to foot traffic at the U.S. Capitol, as the current budget fracas and potential government shutdown unfolds, in Washington, September 30, 2013.The government has shut down.

Goldman Sachs recently published a report listing the stocks of these companies. We pulled the 20 stocks with the most exposure. We've left out pure defense and health care companies, as many provide essential services that will remain intact during the federal spending freeze.

It's also worth noting that many of these names appeared on our list of stocks vulnerable to the sequester — and many ended up doing fine. FREE AppDownload
