ObeoA 21,750-square-foot home in Indian Creek has sold for $28 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Leroy Schecter, chairman of steel manufacturing company Marino/Ware Industries, has had the house on the market since 2008, with the price set as high as $45 million in 2012. Listing agent Nelson Gonzalez of EWM Realty International said that New York-based Schecter is selling because he "just wasn't using the house," and plans to donate the $28 million in proceeds to charity.  The home features seven bedrooms, 12.5 bathrooms, an elevator, a lower level with a seven-car garage, a billiards room, a gym, and a wine cellar.
