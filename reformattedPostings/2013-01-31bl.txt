Business Insider is still on the hunt for a few paid interns to join our editorial team this winter -- specifically for our lists and rankings, lifestyle, and entertainment sections. Don't be dismayed by the term "intern." At Business Insider, there's no getting coffee or making copies. Our interns spend their time doing meaningful work: researching, writing, pitching and producing features -- even breaking news if the timing's right. Interns are encouraged to work full-time if their schedule allows. We do require 3 days a week minimum. Other perks? We have lots of free snacks, and a ping-pong table where we hold quarterly tournaments. When it comes to qualifications, a journalism background always helps, as do copy-editing skills and light HTML and Photoshop experience. Knowledge of social media and previous writing experience are both useful, too. Please send your resume and three writing clips to jliebman@businessinsider.com. Please describe which BI section(s) interest you most and why. And, please note: this internship requires that you work in our Manhattan office. Interested in a journalism internship but have never heard of Business Insider? Here's some reading on our company and where we're headed. Here's another article on our latest round of financing.
