PaganiDeliveries of the the long anticipated Pagani Huayra are finally beginning, and car lovers are thrilled, even if they are not among the very few drivers who will get behind the wheel of the next great supercar. The name "Huayra" comes from the Incan term for "God of the Winds," and Horacio Pagani, the carmaker Car &amp; Driver called a "maniacally obsessed perfectionist," says it was inspired by a jet barreling down the runway just before taking off. Pagani makes only about 40 vehicles a year, but it has already secured orders for 105 Huayras, including 18 in the United States. The cars Pagani does deliver will cost about $1.2 million each: a lot of money for a machine that can rarely be used to its full, 230 mph capacity, and maybe not at all in the U.S., where it has not even street-legal yet, according to CNBC. But apart from the six pieces of fitted luggage that come with the Huayra, there are plenty of ways to justify the sky high price tag.
