Instagram/jaybi_The S&amp;P just hit an all-time record intraday high. The previous high of 1576.09 was set on October 11, 2007. The index rose to 1576.10 after the market opened, but has since backed off a bit to 1575.50. Two weeks ago, the S&amp;P 500 broke the all-time closing high of 1565.16, also set in October 2007, but it took a little longer to make the final 10-point leap to surpass the all-time intraday high as well. Before the market opened, the Federal Reserve was forced to release the minutes from its March 19-20 FOMC meeting after it was revealed that the minutes had been leaked to a few individuals yesterday. The minutes were originally scheduled to be released at 2 PM today. FREE AppDownload
