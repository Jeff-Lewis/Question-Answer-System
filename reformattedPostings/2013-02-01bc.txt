BurberryWhen you think "Burberry," chances are classic trenches or the brand's famous check pattern comes to mind. But Burberry Prorsum decided to go in a very different direction with this season's coats, shirts, and t-shirts by making their designs with shiny metallic cloth in electric colors. The new Metallic Runway collection is made with Italian foil-bonded silk or cotton that requires hand washing. Made for both their men's and women's spring lines, the sheen is available in six shades, including pale green, electric blue, and lavender. Since it's Burberry, we're sure that the quality is impeccable, but these look more like cheap plastic than what the expensive $350-$2,995 price range would suggest. FREE AppDownload
