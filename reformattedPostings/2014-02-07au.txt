Bank of America sent a San Francisco woman an expletive-laced credit card offer that referred to her as a "sl*t." The envelope was addressed to "Lisa Is A Sl*t McIntire" and inside, the letter read, "Lisa Is A Sl*t McIntire, you've earned this special offer." It went on to offer her a Visa Cash Rewards credit card. Here's a photo of the envelope: Hi @BofA_Help. I just received a credit card offer from you that addressed me as “Lisa Is A Slut McIntire.” pic.twitter.com/7OeNZSlNhX Um. pic.twitter.com/koYjGsoF1m After McIntire tweeted a photo of the letter, Bank of America's twitter account responded: "We're incredibly sorry this happened and are researching now so we can take the appropriate action." Here's the letter itself: It's a credit card offer, apparently? I am still discomfited. pic.twitter.com/h1qGPtB15P FREE AppDownload
