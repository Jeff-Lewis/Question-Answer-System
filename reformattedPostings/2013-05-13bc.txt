Brian Kersey/Getty ImagesThe media frenzy surrounding the news that Bloomberg reporters were using their terminals to access important information about bankers, government officials, and more serves to remind us of one thing — the Bloomberg terminal is one of the most powerful machines in the world. If you've never used one before, it's impossible to understand the kind of information users can access. For the most part this is public info (you could find it in a company's filings, fo example), but Bloomberg just makes it customizable and easy to find. We're talking about taking big data, and squeezing it into easy-to-manage charts and lists right at your fingertips. Business Insider contacted terminal users all over the Street to get the functions they consider most valuable. One answer we got that can't even be measured is the fact that users can build their own functions based on their needs. That means some of the best functions out there are probably closely held secrets. Here are a few powerful public functions Wall Streeters told us they couldn't live without. So while this "spying" scandal looks bad, there aren't many people willing to disconnect from all of this stuff. FREE AppDownload
