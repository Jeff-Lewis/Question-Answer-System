REUTERSThe year 2020 will be a seminal one for Japan, with the country's capital home to the 31st Summer Olympiad and adult diapers set to outsell their baby counterparts. The world is getting older, developed countries especially. Even in emerging markets like Brazil, the total fertility rate has dropped from 6.2 live births per women to 1.8, below the so-called "replacement rate." Deutsche Bank global strategist Sanjeev Sanyal recently forecasted that world population will peak around the year 2055 at 8.7 billion before declining to eight billion by 2100. Now, thanks to coder Martin De Wulf and U.N. data, we can really visualize these startling changes. De Wulf arranged population figures to make a set of familiar aging visualizations called population pyramids. We chose 15 countries and show you the transition from 2000 to 2100 in 10-year intervals. France's population will double between 1950 and 2100:  Brazil's population will peak in 2040, at 224 million: Population Pyramid Over two-thirds of Burkina Faso's population was younger than 30 in 2010. By 2100, it will be 45%: Population Pyramid China's population will fall below the one-billion mark around 2090: Population Pyramid India's population will peak in 2060 at 1.7 billion: Population Pyramid Germany's population of over 80 million is already on the decline, and will hit 70.3 million in 2100: Population Pyramid The U.S. will have a population of 478 million in 2100: Population Pyramid In 2020, 20% of Japan will be 70 or older: Population Pyramid Kenya's population will only continue to grow, reaching 168 million by 2100. It was 30 million in 2000: Population Pyramid Argentina's population will peak in 2065 at 51.3 million: Population Pyramid Egypt has a huge youth population right now: Population Pyramid Qatar's population is currently skewed to the male gender, making this pyramid the strangest looking: Population Pyramid South Africa will reach its population peak in 2065 at 57.1 million: Population Pyramid Russia's population will slowly decline and hit 111 million in 2100: Population Pyramid The U.K.'s population will grow to 75 million by 2100: Population Pyramid FREE AppDownload
