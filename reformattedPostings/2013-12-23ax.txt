One of the biggest market cliches we've seen in the last few weeks is that, though the bull market rockets forward, it's becoming increasingly a "stock-picker's market." That's market jargon for the idea that individual stocks are increasingly doing their own thing as opposed to moving in unison. This chart from Bespoke Investment Group shows what's going on.

"Throughout the year, we've seen breadth decline with each successive breakout, so it has definitely become more of a 'stock-picker's market' late in the year."
