People who scream "bubble" at every sign of bullishness are the worst scoundrels. I've described what a REAL bubble looks like before, and it's nothing like now. It's not just that asset prices are inflated, but rather there's an overwhelming sense of optimism about everything; at least that's how it was in 1999. 1999 wasn't just about the dotcom stocks, it was about fuel cells, people transporters (The Segway), cures for diseases, and a general belief that everyone would be great. And so when I see analyst notes talking about Tesla revolutionizing the electricity market, and charts that set a date on the upcoming "utopia" I'm reminded of the bright old days.
