hoyasmeg/FlickrMany a discussion of economic growth centers on the making and moving of goods, but what of the garbage that those products become when they’ve been consumed? The waste industry is a profitable business, and nowhere is it more so than in the world’s most populous country. China generates an estimated 400 million metric tons a year of waste, a total that’s expected to increase 50 percent to 600 million metric tons by 2020, according to Credit Suisse. Waste management companies are scrambling to keep up, and are increasingly turning to trash incineration because of a shortage of landfills. As a result, Credit Suisse estimates the country’s capacity to burn waste will increase 27 percent a year through 2020, while the amount of waste burned to generate electricity and heat should grow 33 percent by that year. High barriers to entry and the aforementioned landfill shortage mean existing industrial waste treatment companies should be well positioned, and Credit Suisse expects industry earnings to rise 15 to 30 percent a year.
