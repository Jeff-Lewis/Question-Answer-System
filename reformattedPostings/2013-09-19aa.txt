The economics website FRED has just added data on median household income and real median household income for all of the states plus the district of Columbia going back to 1984. It's a fun dataset that lets you see how various regions have evolved economically over the last three decades. Playing around with it quickly, we just made this fun chart. It shows median household income in Texas (red line), New York (Green Line), California (orange line), The U.S. overall (blue line) and Washington D.C. (black line). While various areas have peaked at different periods, the D.C. trend is clear, and in recent years, median incomes have absolutely exploded, leaving everyone else in the dust. FRED FREE AppDownload
