Desjardins strategist Ed Sollbach put together an informative table showing every correction of 3.8% or more on the S&amp;P 500 since the stock market rally began in March 2009. In a note to clients Tuesday, Sollbach wrote: The S&amp;P 500 is in the midst of its 12th correction of 3.8% or more since March 2009, and the first 11 were buying opportunities. The S&amp;P 500 has corrected 5.8% over the last 33 days, compared with the average correction of 8.7% over 42 days. Certainly the spike in the VIX to 20.5 and the 4.2% correction in commodity prices suggest the correction is almost over. However, this is only the second correction associated with rising bond yields. After a 91bps spike since only May 2, we would like to see bond yields roll over, reducing the pressure on the all-important recovery in US housing and consumer spending. During the previous 11 corrections, bond yields eventually plunged with equities, so we would look at the beaten-down interest sensitives at this point. (Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.0%, and this morning, futures are up another 0.5%.) Desjardins Capital Markets, Bloomberg
