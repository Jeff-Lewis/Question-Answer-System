YoutubeThe connections between Cyprus and Russian oligarchs are by now well established.  But the press revolving a new megamarina being constructed on the Mediterranean's island's southwest tip suggest it's not just Russian titans who do business there.  The Limassol Marina is billed as "an exclusive waterfront development designed by a world-renowned team of architects and engineers," it would  "combine elegant residences and a state-of-the-art marina with exclusive restaurants and shops, to create a lifestyle uniquely shaped by 'living on the sea'." While the marina's UK sales reps did not respond to our email, we did notice that the website is available in Russian and Chinese translations. And one account from the website SigmaLive also claims interest from "Russia, Israel, Arab Countries and Scandinavia and various countries of Central Europe." The prices also suggest a unique clientele. Apartments range from €370,000 to €2,090,000, while a villa will set you back between €1,650,000 - €6,400,000.  Boat berths — which can accommodate vessels up to 1,000 meters — can cost north of €150,000 a year. The project is actually still under construction — 90 percent of the project’s marine works and 50 percent of the residential development and infrastructure have been completed as of Jan. 1, the site says. They've done at €86 million so far. But when it is completed, it seems like it'll look amazing.
