REUTERS/Jim UrquhartTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Vice Finance Minister Jiro Aichi said on Thursday that the government will consider a response to the closure of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange if necessary, after ascertaining the facts of the case. He also said any regulation of bitcoin requires cooperation among nations to avoid loopholes. The site of Mt.
