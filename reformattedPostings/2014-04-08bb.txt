REUTERS/Adnan AbidiIndia's general elections are underway and expected to wrap up on May 12. The elections will play out on nine days over the next five weeks and start in the north of the country, slowly working their way south. With some 814 million Indians eligible to vote, Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai and his research team have said "the world is about to witness the biggest election in history." The elections are also slated to be the most expensive in Indian history at Rs. 300 billion (about $5 billion), according to Bloomberg. The elections will have major implications not just on policy but also on the nation's growth, which has languished in recent years. "This could herald a sea change for India’s economy, which has struggled with stagflationary-type conditions over the past few years," writes Desai. "We think the incoming government will have to de-anchor inflation, raise capital productivity, improve the investment climate and de-lever private balance sheets to engineer a new growth cycle." Desai highlights five key reforms he expects the new government to push through: So far, surveys suggest that the incumbent party — the Congress Party — will fall, and see a BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and NDA (National Democratic Alliance) coalition winning 230-240 seats and be headed by Narendra Modi. Modi is lauded for having driven growth in the Indian state of Gujarat. But his record is tainted with many pointing fingers at the BJP leader who failed to do anything about the bloody Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 where 1,000 people were killed, though some put the figure much higher. Modi was chief minister of Gujarat at the time. The election results are expected on May 16. FREE AppDownload
