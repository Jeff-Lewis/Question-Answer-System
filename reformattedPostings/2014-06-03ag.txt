The gigafactory is an extraordinary ambitious venture to build lithium ion batteries at a size and scale that hasn't been done before. Tesla now plans to break ground at multiple potential gigafactory locations, with the goal of winnowing them down to one. Earlier, we'd reported that the groundbreaking itself was to be delayed.  “It might actually be three states that we do it in,” Musk said according to Bloomberg. “I would expect that we do a down-select for gigafactory 1 before the end of the year.” Last week, we discussed how the future of Tesla, along with its sister company SolarCity, depend on the success of the gigafactories: To bring down the cost of lithium ion batteries, the scale of their production must be increased by a whole order of magnitude than what currently exists.
