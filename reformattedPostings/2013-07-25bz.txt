Wikimedia CommonsWe're about to get a pulse check on the state of American jobs and business investment. From Calculated Risk's Bill McBride: • At 8:30 AM ET, the initial weekly unemployment claims report will be released. The consensus is for an increase to 341 thousand from 334 thousand last week. • Also at 8:30 AM, the Durable Goods Orders for June from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for a 1.5% increase in durable goods orders. • At 11:00 AM, the Kansas City Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity for July. The consensus is for a reading of 0 for this survey, up from minus 5 in June (Above zero is expansion). FREE AppDownload
