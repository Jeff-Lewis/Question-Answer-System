MarkitManufacturing activity cooled a tiny bit in December. According to Markit, the US manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) slipped to 53.7 in December from 54.8 in November. "The fourth consecutive monthly decline for the Markit PMI has brought the headline index to its lowest level since October of 2013, suggesting manufacturing activity may expand at a slower pace in Q4 than the previous two quarters," Barclays' Jesse Hurwitz said. "We continue to look for real equipment investment to grow an annualized 7% in Q4, following 11.2% and 10.7% growth in Q2 and Q3, respectively." Here are the key points from Markit: "Softer output and employment numbers merely represent a cooling in the pace of expansion from unusually strong rates earlier in the year, but also send a warning light to policymakers that the fourth quarter is likely to see a weakening in the pace of economic growth, which is starting to hit hiring," Markit's Chris Williamson said. "We expect this weakening to become evident in the official data early in the new year, meaning rate setters will continue to err on the side of caution in terms of when the economy may be ready for higher interest rates, especially as the survey data also highlight a further drop in inflationary pressures."
