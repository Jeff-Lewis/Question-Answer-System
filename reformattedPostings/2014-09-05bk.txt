davecsparty/flickrThe August jobs report was a big miss, but not all the data was bad. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 142,000 in August, missing expectations for 230,000. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1% from 6.2%, according to the latest release from the BLS, and this was in-line with expectations. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: "In one line: Noise happens, and this looks like noise. No other data signal slowing labor demand." Wage growth was also in-line with expectations, as wages grew 2.1% year-over-year, and 0.2% month-over-month.  The average number of weekly hours worked held steady at 34.5 hours.  The labor force participation rate also slipped slightly, falling to 62.8% from 62.9% last month.  The "U-6" unemployment rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force or those employed part time for economic reasons, fell to 12% from 12.2% in July.  Here were Wall Street's expectations: The July jobs report was also revised up slightly, to 212,000 from 209,000, while June's report was revised down to 267,000 from 298,000. These charts from the Federal Reserve show the monthly change in nonfarm payrolls, which gained less than expected in August, and the unemployment rate, which declined in-line with expectations. FRED FRED And this chart from the Federal Reserve shows the "U-6" unemployment rate, which includes unemployed workers as well as those marginally attached to the workforce and workers employed part-time for economic reasons, or basically people who want full-time work but have to settle for part-time work instead. In August, the "U-6" rate fell to 12% from 12.2% in July.  FRED The number of employees out of work for more than 27 weeks, or those long-term unemployed, also fell in August to below three million for the first time since the financial crisis.  FRED FREE AppDownload
