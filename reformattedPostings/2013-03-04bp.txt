There's a brand new billionaire financier on the 2013 Forbes Billionaires list, a 53 year-old Hong Kong woman named Pollyanna Chu. Forbes' list puts together the richest people from all over the world and divides them by nationality, industry and age and more. Chu made the list as biggest shareholder and CEO of Kingston Financial, a brokerage firm. In 2010, Chu and her husband Nicholas decided to fold Kingston into another part of their family business, Golden Resorts, a hotel and casino company with properties in Macao including the Grandview Hotel and the Casa Real Hotel.  The couple started Kingston in 1993, after success in the real estate business in California. According to Forbes, Nicholas and Pollyanna both studied and met in the United States. It was Pollyanna's father who said they should look into setting something up in Hong Kong's newly booming market. From there it was all about building, even though Chu says she knew very little about finance when they started. To grow in Asia, Kingston focused on IPO distribution and mergers and acquisitions, becoming a top five firm for the latter in 2010. The Chu's decided to fold the private brokerage into the publicly traded Golden Resorts in hopes to expand internationally. That's how Kingston Financial Holdings came to be. Last year, Chu bought 75% of Sincere Watch, a distributor of Frank Muller watches in mainland China, and added that to her growing empire. She also has a 14.11% stake in a Premier League team, Birmingham City, according to The Daily Mail. Chu holds a B.A. in Management from Golden Gate University and an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy in Business Management from York University. She and her husband have one son named Kingston.
