A staggering 83% of American homebuyers consider a "normal" rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan to be under 5%, new data from Redfin shows. It seems the last few years — in which the Federal Reserve depressed interest rates in an effort to stimulate lending — has had a pretty crazy affect on American memories. Rates have averaged 6.7% since 1990, according to Redfin. The rate for the 30-year mortgage never once dropped below 5% until March 2009.
