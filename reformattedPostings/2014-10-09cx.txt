Berlin (AFP) - Germany's leading economic institutes on Thursday slashed their forecasts for growth this year and next year and said the government needed to increase spending in order to boost growth. The German economy, Europe's biggest, would grow by just 1.3 percent in 2014 and 1.2 percent in 2015, the institutes predicting, much less than the 1.9 percent and 2.0 percent they had previously expected. "Economic growth in Germany has cooled noticeably," the institutes said in their widely watched half-yearly report. "After gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter and likely stagnated in the third quarter, the economic engine is finding it difficult to get going," the report said.  Domestic demand was weak, with the consumer climate deteriorating and companies continuing to scale back investment.  And foreign demand was also weak, with "only sluggish growth in the global economy and slowing momentum in the euro area," the institutes said.  The European Central Bank was "trying its best to stimulate the eurozone economy and interest rates are very low in Germany as a result.  "However, the latest raft of measures are unlikely to provide any additional impulses for the economy," the institutes warned.  The government should therefore increase spending in the public sector, the experts believed. "On the spending side, public spending should be increased in those areas which can  potentially boost growth," the report said.  FREE AppDownload
