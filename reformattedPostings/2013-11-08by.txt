Rob and Stephanie Levy/FlickrAt 8:30 a.m. ET, we get the Non-Farm Payrolls report for October. Analysts expect to see the unemployment rate tick up to 7.3% on 120,000 new jobs. There are two other interesting data points that are also coming out today. From Calculated Risk, they are: • Also at 8:30 a.m., the Personal Income and Outlays report for October. The consensus is for a 0.3% increase in personal income, and for a 0.2% increase in personal spending. And for the Core PCE price index to increase 0.1%.  • At 10:00 a.m., the Reuter's/University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment index (preliminary for November).
