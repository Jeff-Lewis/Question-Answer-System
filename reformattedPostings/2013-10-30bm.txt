Wolf of Wall Street trailerIn the last 24 hours, two awesome pieces of news about Martin Scorcese's "The Wolf of Wall Street" film have broken — first, that it will hit theaters on Dec. 25, and second, that there's a new trailer out (you can watch it below). We've already taken a look at the script, written by Terence Winter, and luckily a bunch of the most awesome scenes seem to have stayed in the movie. You can check out scenes from the movie script here (spoiler alert) » The movie tells the story of Jordan Belfort, a Long Island kid who rose to become a millionaire penny stock scammer and boiler-room boss. Back in the 1990s, Belfort ran Stratton-Oakmont, a Long Island-based pump and dump that found itself on top of the Wall Street world. Think: drugs, hookers, parties with performing midgets. And then it all came crashing down. Belfort went to jail for 20 months and lost everything. Check out the new trailer below:  FREE AppDownload
