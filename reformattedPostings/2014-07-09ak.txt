In the first round of betting, David Tuthill spiced things up by immediately raising to 2,600. The following players around the table all folded... until one unnamed opponent decided to go all in with his last 25,100. Tuthill called, and both players revealed their cards. Tuthill had 10<U+2665> 10<U+2666>, while his opponent had A<U+2660> J<U+2660>. Now, all that there was left to do was to wait while the dealear produced the cards. The first three cards were 8<U+2660> K<U+2660> 3<U+2660>, meaning that the unnamed opponent had just flopped an ace-high flush. According to the WSOP's blog, that flop "elicited an immediate response from Tuthill", who yelled "Flush!" and laughed, no doubt surprised at the outcome. The next two were 4<U+2660> 2<U+2665>, which clinched the win for the unnamed opponent. Bonus Poker Term!David Tuthill was the first to bet in the first round of betting.
