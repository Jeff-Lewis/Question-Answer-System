So far the conclusion is that it probably doesn't mean that much. Markets are mostly doing nothing, though there are some exceptions. The Jakarta stock market had a huge one-day gain of 3.23%. Other emerging market indices were solid, including Egypt (yesterday). India was up 1.3% today. Turkey is currently up 0.6%, and Thailand is up 1.3%. There is no major economic data coming today.
