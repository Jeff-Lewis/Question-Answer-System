Howard Smith-USA TODAY SportsThe Philadelphia Fed's survey of business conditions climbed just 0.5 points to 7.0 from a prior reading of 6.5.  Consensus was for a print of 10.0.  Full release » The labor subcomponent only climbed a point. Still, the index has now been positive for seven consecutive months. The current shipments and new orders indices both increased after falling in November. Capital Economics Amna Asaf commented in a note: "The slight uptick in the US Philly Fed manufacturing index to +7.0 in December, from +6.5, along with the improvement in some of the more forward-looking sub-indices, suggests that the improvement in manufacturing is being sustained. "Looking at the Philly Fed breakdown, the new orders index rebounded to +15.4, from +11.8, and the employment index inched higher to +2.2, from +1.1. Nevertheless, thanks to some sharp declines in the inventories and supplier delivery indices, a simple weighted average of the five main sub-indices actually fell slightly to +7.3 in December, from +7.4.  "Overall, the headline index remains at a decent level whereas, even after the latest rebound, the alternative Empire State index (released on Monday) is only just above zero. Together, the two regional indices point to a modest drop back in the national ISM index in December.  We expect any decline to be very small, however, because the ISM index appears to be more influenced by larger exporters, who appear to be benefitting from the recovery in Europe." Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius considers it one of the best predictors of overall U.S. economic growth. But Citi's Peter D'Antonio disagrees. "In the absence of data we caution against looking at the Philly survey, as it is notoriously erratic and poorly correlated with actual activity, in our view," wrote D'Antonio in a preview of the release.
