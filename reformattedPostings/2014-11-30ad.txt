Chinese manufacturing disappointed again in November. The country's manufacturing PMI missed expectations, coming in at 50.3; analysts expected 50.5. Any number under 50 indicates a contraction in the country's manufacturing sector. HSBC's Chinese manufacturing PMI held steady at October's number — 50.0, right at the breakeven point. This continues a worrisome trend for the country. In October, manufacturing PMI came in at 50.8 — analysts expected 51.1. Until a few weeks ago, President Xi Jinping's administration seemed ready to watch the economy slow down — it even seemed OK with watching 2014 GDP miss its 7.5% target rate. State media reported that anyone in support of a rate cut by the People's Bank of China was not a patriot. Then the PBOC "cut" rates earlier this month. It wasn't a real cut — basically, it dropped the floor for key interest rates but maintained the ceiling, so banks could still charge the same rate if they wanted to. The move was more an indication that more action may be coming, and the markets loved it. Numbers like this PMI miss, however, could upset markets again. A head fake is not enough to cure what ails the Chinese economy — a corporate sector laden with debt that it passes on to Chinese banks. "China's debt problem lies with the corporate sector," Societe Generale analyst Wei Yao wrote in a note. "The cure should be capacity consolidation and debt restructuring, rather than another stimulus package targeted to boost investment demand." FREE AppDownload
