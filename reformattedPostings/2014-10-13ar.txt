Via Sotheby's HomesHedge-fund manager Scott Bommer (who is known for flipping homes in the Hamptons) has finally sold his historic oceanfront estate in Southampton for $16 million, according to Curbed Hamptons.  Bommer originally put the house on the market in September of 2013 for $25 million, but has since had to lower the price multiple times. According to Southampton Village Real Estate, the final price was $16 million — a staggering $9 million and 20% below Bommer's asking price. The historic beach house, known as the Halcyon Lodge, was once a part of the Henry Ford estate. In 1946, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford II commissioned the famous architect Phillip Johnson — known for building The Glass House — to build a one story glass wing addition to the estate. The home sits on 1.5 acres of land with 142 feet of oceanfront. Inside there are eight bedrooms, six baths, a heated pool, and even has a three-bedroom carriage house for guests.
