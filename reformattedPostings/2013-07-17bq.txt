DNAinfo/Noelani MonteroNEW YORK — 7-Eleven has gone high-tech. The chain's expansive new Financial District outpost, which sits at the corner of John and Pearl streets, boasts touch-screen ordering, free Wi-Fi, a huge flat-screen TV and even an Amazon Locker — a kiosk where Amazon customers can pick up their online-ordered goods. Click here to jump right to the pictures &gt; The new 7-Eleven opened last week —  just in time to celebrate the chain's annual"Free Slurpee Day" on July 11 — and looks more like a cafe than a convenience store, with enough space to seat about 25 people. “It’s really, really cool, and it feels very different from the other 7-Elevens,” said 29-year-old Rachel Stallworth, a Fort Greene resident who works nearby. Stallworth enjoyed a coffee in the back seating area on the second day the 7-Eleven was open and said she was impressed with unusual features including beer tap-style beverage dispensers. “It makes for a more exciting experience,” she said. The sleeker outpost also offers some healthier menu options, including multi-grain sandwiches, egg whites and specialty salads. And customers can order all of the store's food with just the touch of a screen. “I like anything that you can browse on the screen and not have to talk to employees,” joked Darci Ratliff, an East Village resident. The John Street 7-Eleven also has a large-screen television that displays the weather, subway delays, sports statistics and stock information.  “I’m hoping they turn more of the stores into something like this,” Ratliff added. Lena Huang, manager of 7-Eleven’s Digital Guest Experience, said the new ordering screens, television and Amazon Locker were part of a strategy meant to enhance the store's "hangout" vibe.  “I want to make sure that people want to come back," Huang said. "We want to make it everyone’s neighborhood store — that’s the idea.” FREE AppDownload
