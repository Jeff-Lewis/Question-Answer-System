Meanwhile, the latest reports continue to suggest that the U.S. is heading for a spring swoon.  As such, everyone will be looking for clues of a pick-up or slowdown in economic activity. Indeed, this week will be busy with economic data, and major companies like Caterpillar, Apple, Boeing, Starbucks, and ExxonMobil all announcing their Q1 financial results. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update "Of the 102 companies that have reported earnings to dat for Q1 2013, 72% have reported earnings above the mean estimate and 45% have reported revenues above the mean estimate," said FactSet's John Butters. Despite the beats, growth is expected to be just above break even.  And this is as corporate profit margins sit at record highs.  This is a combination that has market skeptics like John Hussman concerned. "This fragile equilibrium that we're in because of monetary policy, because of fiscal policy, and because of the combination of yield-seeking plus the apperence of yield through forward operating earnings because profit margins are elevated — this creates an environment where stock returns prospectively are very low," he argued in a recent presentation. Hussman sees 3.5% average annual returns in the stock market over the next ten years. FREE AppDownload
