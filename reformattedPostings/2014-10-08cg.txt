Investors are piling into government bonds, causing yields to fall to new lows as fears over the health of the global economy grow. Government bonds are usually seen as a safe alternative to stocks, which react in a more volatile way to bad news. As bond prices rise because of the influx of new demand, the interest "yield" on top of them falls by a corresponding amount. The fact that investors are willing to pay rising prices for an instrument that pays them less and less is an indicator that fear is their motivating factor. The renewed interest in government bonds comes after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast again on Tuesday. In the latest edition of the World Economic Outlook, the Fund said it expected global growth to be 3.3% in 2014 — 0.4% lower than it predicted in April and 0.1% below what it was forecasting in July. This has helped drive pessimism over the sustainability of the global economic recovery and pushed investors to seek the perceived safe haven of government debt — even though adjusting for the impact of inflation they are losing money in doing so. Conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine aren't helping, either.

Unfortunately, the recent downgrades have been caused by consistently disappointing growth figures coming out of these markets.
