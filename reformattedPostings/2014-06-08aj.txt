Going to work and collecting paychecks isn't the only way to make money in America. "Since 1980, direct labor income has become a smaller share of personal income, while income from transfers has risen," write Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Sarah Watt House. "This mix may help to stabilize consumption but also reflects altered incentives to work." Wages and salary continue to be primary source of income, but have fallen from 59% of personal income in 1980 to just 51% today. Silvia and House identify three reasons why this is happening: Silvia and House note that unfavorable labor market dynamics are also a factor. "We suspect this is a product of both demand and supply forces," they write. "On the demand side, firms have been cautious to hire given the modest and uncertain gains in final demand. In addition, as global markets continue to expand, firms are increasing their hiring abroad to serve markets there. On the supply side, the availability of transfer payments and mandated benefits have increased the reservation wage for many workers and lowered the cost of additional leisure. Moreover, an excess supply of labor relative to demand has kept wage growth muted. restraining labor income even as hiring has improved." Whatever the reasons, it's very clear that labor is playing a smaller role in the average personal income statement. Wells Fargo Securities FREE AppDownload
