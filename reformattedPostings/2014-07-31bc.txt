Thomson ReutersL-3 Communications Holdings Inc CEO Michael Strianese speaks during Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit 2010 in Washington(Reuters) - L-3 Communications Holdings Inc said it fired four employees as part of an ongoing internal review that revealed overstatement of net sales and deferred cost overruns in the company's aerospace business. The company's shares fell as much as 14 percent to $103.01 on Thursday, their biggest intraday percentage drop ever. L-3, which provides communication and electronics systems to the U.S. military, said another employee had resigned in connection with the review. The company said the overstatement primarily related to a "fixed-price" maintenance and logistics support contract that began in December 2010 and runs through January 2015. L-3 cited misconduct and accounting errors including concealment from L-3's corporate staff at its aerospace systems business for the overstatement and deferred cost overruns. The company said it expected to take a related pretax charge of $84 million and a $43 million reduction in net sales. L-3 reported on Thursday preliminary sales of $3.02 billion for the second quarter ended June 27. "We have no reason to believe that this issue occurred at any other segment of the company," Chief Executive Michael Strianese said on a conference call with analysts. He declined to give more details about the review. L-3 said about $50 million of the charge related to periods prior to 2014 and about $30 million related to the second quarter of 2014. The company also cut its 2014 operating margin forecast for the aerospace systems business to 9.0-9.2 percent from 10.6-10.8 percent.
