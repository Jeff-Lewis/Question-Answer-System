REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonAt 122 billionaires, China has the second-largest concentration of billionaires in the world, according to Forbes. Yet 13% of China's population lives on less than $1.25 a day.  China has a high Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality. In fact, during his outgoing speech at the 2012 National People's Congress, then president Hu Jintao said China should try and double its 2010 per capita income for urban and rural residents by 2020. The Communist Party is wary of the growing wealth gap because of the risk it poses in the form of social unrest. To show just how disparate the lifestyle of wealthy Chinese is from China's poor, we drew on 22 images from Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon.
