  Augie RayA subway train derailed in the Woodside area of Queens this morning, leaving 19 passengers injured, including four who were potentially seriously injured, according to CBS New York. FDNY and paramedics were on the scene quickly and evacuated the approximately 1,000 passengers on the 8-car train. Passengers had to be evacuated 20 at a time as they had to leave through a narrow emergency access point.  The train that derailed was a Manhattan-bound F Train that was running on the express track. The derailment occurred near Broadway and 65th Street at around 10:40 AM. Its still not clear what caused the train to derail. “The first car of the train made it through without derailing. The following cars then, about six cars, derailed and the final car stayed on the track,” NYPD Chief of Patrol James Hall said at a news conference this afternoon. While there are currently delays on the E, R, F, and M lines, due to the derailment, MTA officials said that they are hoping to restore local service in time for the evening rush.
