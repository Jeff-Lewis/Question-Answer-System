And significantly, supply decreased to 4.1 months supply at current sales pace compared with 4.8 months in December, and 5.3 months a year ago. The months' supply figure was down 14.6 percent MoM, and 22.6 percent year-over-year (YoY). The number of homes however stayed flat at 150,000 in January, and was up from 149,000 a year ago. Paul Diggle at Capital Economics writes that today's data shows that "supply conditions are extremely tight" and that home price gains should pick up this year. "Indeed, taking new and existing homes together, the relationship between the months’ supply of unsold homes and house prices points to an acceleration in the pace of house prices gains in the year ahead."
