According to a brand new BLS employment report, unemployment rates were lower in 322 out of 372 metropolitan areas, higher in 36 areas and unchanged in 14 areas compared to the same time last year. Yuma, Ariz. and El Centro, Calif. recorded the highest unemployment rates at 27.5 and 26.6 percent — both cities have a large immigrant and migrant farm worker population.  The largest unemployment rate drop (-3.2 percent) took place in Pascagoula, Miss., and Bismarck, N.D. registered the lowest unemployment rate at 2.6 percent. In the new year, President Obama is planning on creating 1.1 million jobs from the American Job Acts, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The BLS' data isn't adjusted for seasonal factors, such as hiring during the holidays. FREE AppDownload
