Spanish news wire EFE says that that at least 11 of the 130 banks the European Central Bank is now in charge of testing have failed their reviews. That's across six countries.  Three of the banks are Greek, three are Italian, two are Austrian, one is in Cyprus, one is Belgian and one is Portuguese, according to the report. It definitely looks like there was a market reaction: here's the euro falling against the dollar just as the report broke at 3:46 a.m. ET.

It has been widely reported that Irish bank PTSB has failed the ECB side of the tests. The ECB have now responded to the report, but they're not really denying it:  FREE AppDownload
