The biggest of the datapoints is going to be the ADP Jobs report for May, which serves as a proxy for the official Non-Farm Payrolls report, which will be coming out on Friday. Here are the three datapoints, via Calculated Risk: • At 8:15 AM, the ADP Employment Report for May will be released. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 171,000 payroll jobs added in May.  • At 10:00 AM, the ISM non-Manufacturing Index for May. The consensus is for a reading of 53.8, up from 53.1 in April. Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction.  • Also at 10:00 AM, the Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders (Factory Orders) for April. The consensus is for a 1.4% increase in orders. FREE AppDownload
