ANNMark Karpeles, the French programmer who was at the helm of Bitcoin megaexchange MtGox at the time of its collapse, has begun Tweeting again.  His @magicaltux account had been silent since January. A month later, he announced the exchange had lost nearly half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoins under mysterious circumstances. Early last month, Karpeles began responding in French to Tweets directed at him concerning an email server, though it was not clear whether Karpeles was referring to a Gox server. Several weeks later, Karpeles said he would be back to Tweeting more regularly as "things had calmed down," and that he was now at work on reestablishing their hosting service.   Here are his recent two most recent non-directed Tweets.
