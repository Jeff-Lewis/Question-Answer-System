According to the BEA's third and final estimate, third quarter U.S. GDP grew 4.1% at an annualized rate. Economists were looking for a 3.6% print. Personal consumption growth also grew to 2.0% from the previous 1.4% estimate. Even real final sales growth, often heralded as a more important figure, was revised up to 2.5% from last month's tepid estimate of 1.9%. FREE AppDownload
