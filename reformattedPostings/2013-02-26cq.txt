APWe just noted that the Italian market is plunging today -- down nearly 5% -- after an election that seems virtually guaranteed to lead to a hung parliament or an unstable coalition incapable of doing anything. The vote was not only a rejection of the current "reform" path, it was a big rejection of the EU/Merkel/the ECB/etc. Anyway, the fallout isn't limited to Italian stocks. Spain is down 3.4%, and its borrowing costs are spiking to. Meanwhile, Germany is down 2%. France is down 2.59%. For more on the Italian wreck, see here &gt; FREE AppDownload
