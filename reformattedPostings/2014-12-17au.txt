A 2002 Fortune magazine story, featuring Sallie Krawcheck on the cover, began like this: Sallie Krawcheck, dubbed "the last honest analyst" in the wake of that piece, was known for speaking the truth. That reputation helped catapult her to top leadership positions at Citigroup and Bank of America, tenures that were not without tumult. Today, she is Chair of Ellevate Network. Here, with the benefit of all of those experiences, she offers her advice to today's young analysts. Produced by Devan Joseph and Alana Kakoyiannis. Follow BI Video: On Twitter
