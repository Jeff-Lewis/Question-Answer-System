Yesterday, billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, 83, married 42-year-old health care consultant Tamiko Bolton at his estate in Bedford, New York.  According to the New York Post, the wedding ceremony was intimate with only a few friends and family in attendance.  Afterwards, there was a huge party with 500 guests, the report said.  We were able to track down some photos on Instagram of newlyweds celebrating.  Here we have a video of Soros and Bolton sharing a dance:      They look so happy.   Bolton made an appearance in a black lace gown for the cocktail reception.   A string quartet plays inside the reception.   The floral arrangements were stunning.
