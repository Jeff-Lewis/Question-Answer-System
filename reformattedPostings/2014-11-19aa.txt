T. Rowe PriceT. Rowe Price released its 2015 global market outlook. The outlook is fairly neutral: nothing terrible is expected, but T. Rowe Price advises "investors to moderate their expectations for investment returns in the years ahead, despite the markets’ impressive resilience during the past 12 months." The report also says to expect divergence in various markets globally. "Coming out of the global financial crisis, economic healing has taken place at different paces in various markets around the world," said Bill Stromberg, head of equity of T. Rowe Price. "Stock prices in the U.S. have soared while they have lagged in Europe, Japan, and some emerging markets. We expect more volatility in 2015 and investors will need to be selective. Fundamental equity research and individual stock selection will be more important than ever." Stromberg delivered his outlook with this 19-slide presentation. Thanks to T.
