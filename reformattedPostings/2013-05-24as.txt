Wikimedia CommonsU.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday and Thursday. That's not something we're used to seeing too much lately. This morning, the bloodletting continues. The S&amp;P 500 is trading near 1644, down 0.4%. This comes after a totally insane session in Japan again Friday, which saw the market rally 3% in the early going before going red in the afternoon and then bouncing back by a hair late in the day. European markets closed in the red across the board. Spain took the worst of it there, ending down 1.0%. In commodities, WTI crude oil is down 0.4%, while metals and agricultural commodities are down pretty much across the board. Ten-year Treasury yields are a basis point lower at 2.01%, while Italian and Spanish government bond yields widened 11 and 12.5 basis points to 4.12% and 4.40%, respectively. Durable goods orders surprised to the upside this morning, but the release was unable to buoy markets. FREE AppDownload
