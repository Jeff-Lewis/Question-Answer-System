An incredible infographic created by Joey Cherdarchuk at Darkhorse Analytics shows Manhattan's work and home population by the hour in a "breathing map." The blue spots represent people at home, and the orange spots represent people at work. The orange starts to get brighter at about 5 or 6 a.m., and the blue brightens significantly starting at 5 or 6 p.m., suggesting that most New Yorkers spend about 12 hours a day away from their apartments. The orange "work" spots are concentrated in midtown and downtown, where most office buildings are. Check it out: Darkhorse Analytics About 1.5 million people live in Manhattan and about 2 million people work there. Cherdarchuk explained how he created the map on Darkhorse's blog.
