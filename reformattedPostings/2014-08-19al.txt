Melia Robinson/Business InsiderSusana Ho celebrates her Flip Cup semifinal win at Club Getaway.More than 1 million adults attend camp each year, looking to relive their childhood memories or experience a summertime tradition for the first time. While kids' camp attendance has declined, forcing many organizations to shutter their cabins and sell off their land, the number of camps for grown-ups has swelled faster than a mosquito bite, totaling 800. That's an estimated 10% increase a year over the past 10 years, according to the American Camp Association affiliate GrownUpCamps.com. And when campfire s'mores and sing-alongs are mixed with "flip cup" tournaments and a bunch of singles cavorting to DJ music, the result is a rowdy sleepaway camp experience unlike the one you may remember from childhood. I recently attended Club Getaway in Kent, Connecticut, which hosts 10,000 adult campers annually, to see what all the buzz is about.
