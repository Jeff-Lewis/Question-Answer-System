REUTERSChilean traders gesture as stocks fall at the Santiago Stock Exchange January 9. Good morning! After a brutal US session, the selloff has gone global. And it's continuing. First in Japan, the Nikkei fell 2.4%. That was slightly off the worst levels of the session, but that's still pretty rough, and it caused the index to have its worst week since Fukushima. Meanwhile, Europe continues to slide. Germany's DAX is currently down about 1.6%. The FTSE is down 1.2%. Earlier in the morning, US futures had indicated a very tiny bump, but that has completely reversed course. One negative catalyst today: JPMorgan has whiffed on earnings and the stock is down 2% in pre-market trading. NASDAQ futures are now pointing down 0.4%. FREE AppDownload
