Ari Wald, a technical analyst with Oppenheimer, is out with a note this morning that outlines five signals that indicate a bull market top. "As it stands," Wald writes, "we think the absence of these signals argue against an imminent end to the cycle." The signals, per Wald, are: Of the arguments Wald outlines in favor the bull market not indicating a top, we think the volatility measure bears close watching.
