After a brutal sell-off Tuesday, Russia stepped in to stabilize the ruble.  And it looks like this worked.  According to a Bloomberg report, the Russian finance ministry stepped in to buy rubles after the currency was crushed on Monday and Tuesday of this week, with one US dollar buying as many as 80 rubles early Tuesday morning. Just a few months ago, one dollar bought less than 40 rubles.  But on Wednesday, the ruble rose more than 8% against the dollar, and near 10:20 am ET, the ruble was trading at around 62 against the dollar. Here's the volatile action in the USD/RUB pair — which buys US dollars and sells Russian rubles — from Wednesday morning.  As this chart goes lower, the ruble gains against the dollar. Bloomberg.com Russia's intervention in the currency market follows reports that in some regions of Russia, banks had completely run out of US dollar as Russians frantically sought to convert their rubles to dollars amid the sharp devaluation in the currency.  And a report from Reuters noted that the currency crisis poses a major risk to the two main pillars underwriting the stability of Russian President Vladimir Putin's popular support: financial stability and prosperity.  After a tumultuous session for the ruble on Monday, the Russian central bank on Tuesday night unexpectedly raised interest rates to 17% from 10.5%.  In a note to clients on Wednesday, analysts at UBS wrote that until the ruble "settles down," further rate hikes cannot be ruled out.  FREE AppDownload
