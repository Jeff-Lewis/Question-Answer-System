Jeffrey ColléIf you're going to buy in the Hamptons, you might as well go big. The Pond House by Georgica Pond in East Hampton was recently listed for more than $30 million. Everything from its high ceilings to the front portico gives the home an "old world meets new world" feel. And for good reason. The house was originally built by famous "American Renaissance" architect Stanford White over 100 years ago. But over the past few years, builder Jeffrey Colle renovated, enlarged, and even rotated the home to give it a 21st century update. Now it's a custom-designed, 12,000-square-foot mansion that includes six bedrooms, a guest cottage, a pool, and media room for a very new-world price tag of $32,950,000.
