Kimberly White/Getty ImagesTwitter CEO Dick CostoloTwitter delivered a good earnings report, but it wasn't good enough. Twitter's stock dropped 10% after the report hit despite delivering results that were in line with expectations.  Basically, investors don't want Twitter to meet their lowered expectations, they want Twitter to blow them away.  That didn't happen. Here are the numbers: For Twitter, the only thing that really matters is user growth. On the earnings call, CEO Dick Costolo explained his view of Twitter users.  He sees users as a concentric circle with core users at the center of the circle. Outside of that is logged out users, who are 1-2X the size of the core logged in users. Outside of that are people that just see tweets syndicated across other media.  Costolo believes Twitter has an opportunity to convert those logged out users into logged in users. Short of that, he also thinks Twitter has an opportunity to generate revenue from them.  Twitter CFO Anthony Noto talked about logged out users in depth during the call. He said there are four ways logged out users end up at Twitter: 1. They do a specific search for something related to Twitter, and they land at Twitter. 2. They do a general search for a topic and end up at Twitter. 3. They come to Twitter.com, but get no content and just bounce off the page. 4. They see tweets on ESPN/CNN/etc. and come to Twitter. In each of these cases, Noto said there are things that Twitter can do to convert logged out users to logged in users.
