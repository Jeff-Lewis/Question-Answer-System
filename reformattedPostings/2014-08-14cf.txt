Wal-Mart also cut its forecast for full-year earnings from continuing operations to $4.90-$5.15 per share from $5.10-$5.45, citing higher employee healthcare costs and increased investment in its online business. Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.09 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the second quarter ended July 31 from $4.07 billion, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier. U.S. same-store sales were flat in the quarter. Total revenue rose to $120.13 billion.  (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti Pandey) FREE AppDownload
