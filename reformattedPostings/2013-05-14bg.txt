CHICAGO (AP) — Donald Trump is known for grilling contestants on his TV show, "Celebrity Apprentice." But he'll be the one in hot seat Tuesday as he takes the stand at a civil trial in Chicago. Several of Trump's companies are named in a lawsuit filed by an 87-year-old investor who says she was lured into buying condos at his namesake Chicago skyscraper with promises of a profit-sharing deal that was later quietly withdrawn. Jacqueline Goldberg bought two condos for around $1 million apiece at the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in 2006. She says she and other investors were promised a percentage of profits from banquet hall rentals and other building services. She's seeking unspecified damages. Trump's lawyer says Goldberg signed documents giving Trump executives the power to cancel the profit-sharing offer. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.
