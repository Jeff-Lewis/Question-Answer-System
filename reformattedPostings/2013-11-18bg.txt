Bitcoin has surged again, to $675, a new all-time high. It's now back to $666. The surge was likely fueled by comments submitted by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke voicing support for digital currencies: "...while these types of innovations may pose risks related to law enforcement and supervisory matters, there are also areas in which they may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system." Nor do they appear not to be heeding analysis from Izabella Kaminska, who says we are witnessing a massive short squeeze. Prices were below $600 just a few hours ago, and since trading in the currency began today it's moved up about $145. Chart:  clarkmoody FREE AppDownload
