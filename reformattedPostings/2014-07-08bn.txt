On this quarter's list of the stocks with the biggest upside are tech high-flyers like eBay, salesforce.com and, of course, Netflix. Industrial names like U.S. Steel and PACCAR are also on the list. Over the first half of the year, the S&amp;P 500 may have gained 7%, but according to Goldman, the 20 stocks with the most price target upside could land investors a 26% to 51% increase.
