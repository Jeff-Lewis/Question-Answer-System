Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderFrom Calculated Risk, two interesting economic datapoints are coming out today: • At 8:30 AM ET, Retail sales for June will be released. The consensus is for retail sales to increase 0.8% in June, and to increase 0.5% ex-autos. • Also at 8:30 AM, the NY Fed Empire Manufacturing Survey for July. The consensus is for a reading of 5.0, down from 7.8 in June (above zero is expansion). Retail sales will be especially interesting, as the US consumer has been a hero of the recovery.
