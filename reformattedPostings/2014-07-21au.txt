One of the popular summer activities in New York City is taking a yoga class in the park. I took one of the free classes, part of Bryant Park Yoga, which classes are held on Tuesday morning, and Thursday night, and are sponsored by Athleta, a sports clothing line by GAP. I put on a GoPro on my head and filmed this short timelapse to show that a 60-minute class looks like from the point of view of the participants. Produced by Kamelia Angelova and Alana Kakoyannis.
