After falling 15 points at its lowest overnight, S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures were up 4 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a slightly higher open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures &lt;1YMc1&gt; edged up 17 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures rose 6 points.   (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Bernadette Baum) FREE AppDownload
