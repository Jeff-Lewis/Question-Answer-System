It's partner day at Goldman Sachs! The list of the 78 new partners is out. (See below.)  That brings the total number of partners at Goldman to 467, or 1.6% of the full-time staff at the firm. Being named a partner at Goldman is a huge deal. It's one of the most coveted titles on Wall Street. The bank picks new partners every two years in an extremely intensive and secretive selection process.  In 2012, the bank tapped only 70 partners compared to 110 in the previous cycle. The size of the partner class isn't pre-dictated, though. However, it usually tends to be between 1.5% and 1.9% of the full-time employee population at the firm.  Here are some quick stats about this year's class: This morning, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and president/COO Gary Cohn personally called folks at their desks to let them know they've been made a partner. The calls usually begin around 5 a.m. EST with the Asia offices and continue until around 9 a.m. EST. "We are pleased to announce that the following individuals have been invited to become partners as of January 1, 2015, the start of our next fiscal year. These appointments recognize some of Goldman Sachs’ most valued senior professionals, their embodiment of our culture and values, and their leadership of the firm’s business and people.  We look forward to their continued strong performance and leadership in the years ahead," Blankfein and Cohn wrote in an internal email to Goldman employees.  Here's the full list:    FREE AppDownload
