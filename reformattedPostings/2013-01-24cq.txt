brankomaster / Flickr UPDATE: What's interesting is that markets have mostly recovered from earlier, when things were in the red. Apple will be a big drag on the NASDAQ today, and the S&amp;P to some extent. But markets are mostly ho-hom at this point, and Europe has gone from red to slightly positive. EARLIER: The big story today, obviously, will be the Apple earnings debacle, which caused the stock to fall more than 10% after hours last night. NASDAQ futures are going to get hammered, as the stock has such a big weighting in that index. The question is whether Apple spreads elsewhere. There may not be much of a reason to worry, as Apple went from $700 to $500, while the overall market made new high after new high. Europe is down modestly across the board. Italy, for example, is down 0.35%. Asia had a big night after China's Flash PMI hit a 24-month high. FREE AppDownload
