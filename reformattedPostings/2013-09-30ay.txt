C-SPAN Less than 10 hours before the federal government was set to partially shut down, the Senate voted Monday afternoon to kill both amendments passed in the House of Representatives on Sunday that would make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act.  The motion to table the House amendments — one that delayed Obamacare by a year, and one that repealed a tax on medical devices — passed by a party-line, 54-46 vote. That sends the continuing resolution back into the hands of the House. Unless House Speaker John Boehner agrees to bring the so-called "clean" Senate CR to the floor and rely on Democratic votes, the government will shut down. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Sunday that Republicans will look to pass a bill that would "have fundamental changes into Obamacare that can protect the economy for America." House Republicans are hashing out their strategy in a closed-door meeting Monday afternoon.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell floated the idea of a one-week bill to keep the government funded while a longer-term deal is negotiated. Many Democrats say the idea is a non-starter, and they question whether conservatives would accept the deal, as well. "A week would change nothing. The bill we are discussing is only 6-weeks long to begin with!!!" a Senate Democratic aide said. FREE AppDownload
