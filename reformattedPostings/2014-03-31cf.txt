"Just as we saw numerous economic data falter due to weather over the past three months, we are now entering the period when pent-up demand should begin to emerge, and a reacceleration in economic activity will become more apparent," said Deutsche Bank's Brett Ryan.

Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Fed Chair Janet Yellen suggested that it could be six months between the end of quantitative easing and the first interest rate hike. This has investors increasingly concerned about how they should be positioned in advance of rising policy rates. Credit Suisse's Andrew Garthwaite looks to recent history for guidance. "Historically, markets have not sold off until six months before the first tightening and even during the first rate hike (after a long series of cuts), the de-rating in the 12 months following the first rise has been relatively modest at 2% (8%, if we exclude 1997)," wrote Garthwaite. "Perhaps the period that most resembles the current episode is around 28 January 2004, when Greenspan changed from discussing a ‘considerable period’ to ‘the Committee believes that it can be patient’. The market correctly understood this to mean that a rate hike was coming (rates were raised in June) – and equity prices fell by 4% over the following 6 months. However, the crucial difference is that Greenspan's remark preceded the first rate hike by five months, while Yellen's remark would suggest that the first rate hike will only happen in a year's time, at the earliest."
