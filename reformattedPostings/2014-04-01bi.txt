REUTERSIt's April Fools' Day and you can expect that some pranks and jokes might be pulled on Wall Street. But the pranks are nothing like they used to be. If you ever get the chance to speak to a veteran floor trader, you really should. They're likely full of incredible stories about the good (or bad) ole days on the floor.  They'll probably tell you about the amazing sense of camaraderie on the floor and the epic pranks they used to pull on each other.     "Every joke was invented down there," a retired NYSE specialist said.   "I always tell people that it was like being in a fraternity.  The biggest jokes that were played on new workers and even better when companies had their clients come to visit were the spurs, an arrow on their backs.  When the arrow (which was made of paper) was placed on their back everyone would do a tribal dance and chants.  The customers had no idea what was going on, it was comical," a former NYMEX clerk told us. However, the humor has subsided in recent years since some of the exchanges are publicly traded and have more eyes and television cameras on them. "Fortunately, or unfortunately, you don't see those pranks anymore," another veteran floor trader told Business Insider. Veteran traders both in New York and Chicago from the NYSE, CBOT, NYMEX and AMEX told us about some of the classic pranks and jokes they used to pull back in the day.  * If you have another trading floor prank, joke or story you would like to share, please send Julia an email at jlaroche@businessinsider.com.   FREE AppDownload
