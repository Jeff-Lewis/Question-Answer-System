Dealbook screengrabEarlier we did a post on the phenomenon of "Goldenfreude" which means taking pleasure at the collapse in gold prices. We asked a bunch of notable names why they thought gold falling inspired such glee. One of the responses we got was from Paul Krugman, whose answer was pretty solid: Well, the inflationistas/goldbugs are really, really annoying -- all this air of having the secret wisdom when they actually haven't a clue. And they have been a real destructive factor in policy debate, standing in the way of effective policy by raising fears of Weimar and Zimbabwe. So seeing the one thing they got right -- betting on higher gold prices -- turn sour is cause for a bit of celebration. For more on goldenfreude, see here &gt; FREE AppDownload
