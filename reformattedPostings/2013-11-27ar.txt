The Fine Young GentlemanMinus a few exceptions, men can't buy a good pair of dress shoes for under $350. The idea of the $150 dress shoe (most of which have cemented on soles and corrected grain leather, those noted in this article are of course not that) is a false economy. You will go through multiple pairs of said junk shoes before you would go through one pair of well made welted shoes. Think of it this way: “You are either in your bed or in your shoes. So it pays to invest in both.” Remarked John Wildsmith, who was an English shoemaker.  Luckily, the price of that investment has become more reasonable over the past few years with a plethora of upstart men’s dress shoe brands popping up across the globe. A man doesn’t have to just look to England, Italy and America to find well-made dress shoes. Singapore, Spain, Portugal, China and Mexico are all capable of producing quality shoes at a reasonable price. However, to find many of these brands you often had to head to the Internet. Whether or not you would buy a pair of dress shoes online without trying them on first is a matter of personal preference. But just know that if you are open to it, you often have the opportunity of getting a better value.  For those of you not comfortable with doing so, there are solid options to be had in person. But as is often the case, you get what you pay for, so you should expect to get a substantially better shoe for $350 than $135.  So without further delay, here’s a list of 12 brands you should check out for less than $350. FREE AppDownload
