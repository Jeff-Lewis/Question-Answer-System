Dell Inc./FlickrWomen may make up nearly 50% of the workforce, but many of the most powerful and influential companies in the U.S. have yet to make meaningful moves to advance women into top leadership positions.  For eight consecutive years, there has been no significant uptick in corporate board seats held by women in the Fortune 500, reports a new study by Catalyst, the nonprofit research organization. "The rate of growth of women on boards is glacial. It's simply unacceptable," Daniel F. Akerson, CEO of General Motors, said to the audience at a recent gathering of the Women's Forum of New York at the New York Stock Exchange. For its part, GM has several women installed on its board and recently tapped Mary Barra to be its next and first-ever female CEO. "If you're a senior executive, put it right at the CEO's table," said Akerson. In 2013, 922 board seats were held by women, compared to 4,524 seats held by men. That means women held just 16.9% of these influential positions this year, which barely budged from the 16.6% they held in 2012.  The low representation of women on boards has been and continues to be a major problem in the U.S., says Catalyst. Today, less than one-fifth of big companies have at least 25% of women on their boards. The lack of progress for women in these leadership positions may affect how well companies perform, since studies show that Fortune 500 companies with the highest percentage of women board members financially outperform firms with the lowest percentage. Despite this performance advantage, however, there are still 48 companies on the Fortune 500 with zero women on their boards, according to data provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which looked at board members as of June 30, 2013.
