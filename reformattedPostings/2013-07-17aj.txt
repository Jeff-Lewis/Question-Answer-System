Tesla's stock closed up 10.3% to $120.25. This came on news that Andrea James of Dougherty &amp; Co., raised her price target to $200 from $90. "We ultimately believe Tesla is a $300 stock at the factory’s maximum capacity, which we hair cut to $200 for the execution risk," Bloomberg cites James' writing in the bullish note. "We believe that Tesla is the only firm that has figured out how to make” electric vehicle technology 'work'". The stock tumbled 14% on Tuesday following a note by Goldman Sachs' Patrick Archambault who amended his price target to $84. He also presented his bear case price target of $58.
