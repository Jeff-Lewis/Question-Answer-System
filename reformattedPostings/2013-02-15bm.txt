AP ImagesThe University of Michigan's preliminary February consumer confidence survey reading is out. The reading suggests the index jumped to 76.3 in January, ahead of estimates for a slighter rise to 74.8 from last month's 73.8 reading. The economic conditions sub-component increased to 88.0 from 85.0 last month. The economic outlook sub-component increased to 68.7 from 66.6 last month. Solid gains in both sub-components mark a change from last month, when sentiment toward current economic conditions fell and that toward future conditions rose. Inflation expectations 1-year ahead were unchanged at 3.3 percent, while expectations for inflation 5 years out ticked up to 3.0 percent from 2.9 percent. FREE AppDownload
