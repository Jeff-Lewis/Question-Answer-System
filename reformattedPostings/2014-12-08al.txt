And there are no candidates yet.  On Monday, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras announced that Greece's presidential elections will be held on December 17, two months earlier than scheduled, according to a report from German news agency DPA (via Bloomberg). The report said Greek officials made the move in order to bring "political clarity" to Greece.  If Greece does not elect a president on December 17, snap parliamentary elections will be called. DPA's report cited Samaras spokeswoman Sofia Voultepsi, who said no candidates have been named yet. According to headlines from Bloomberg, the radical opposition party Syriza, best known for its opposition to the eurozone's bailout of Greece, said the government doesn't have the votes needed to elect a president.  Also on Monday, a report from The Financial Times said that Greece and finance ministers in the eurozone agreed to extend Greece's bailout by two months after the government failed to adopt the economic reforms required to get the last of their rescue funds. The FT's report added that Syriza has been leading public-opinion surveys as of late.  And so while the European Central Bank deals with flagging economic growth and rapidly declining inflation, the eurozone might have to respond to political unrest in Greece, too.         FREE AppDownload
