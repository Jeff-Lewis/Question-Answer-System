Morningstar, Business InsiderPIMCO flagship Total Return Fund saw another month of net outflows. According to new data from Morningstar, the fund managed by Bill Gross saw net outflows of around $4.29 billion in May. That's the 13th straight month of net outflows for a cumulative total amount of $59.55 billion. PIMCO has attracted a lot of attention in recent months, largely due to the unexpected departure of CEO Mohamed El-Erian and revelations of Co-CIO Gross's unorthodox management style. For investors, however, the top concern continues to be performance. On this end, PIMCO delivered in May. According to a spokesperson for PIMCO, the Total Return Fund beat 79% of its competitors. Outflows are not an industry-wide phenomenon. Competitor DoubleLine Funds, led by other bond king Jeff Gundlach, saw $485 million in net inflows in May into its flagship Total Return Fund. With performance improving and the bond market seeing a bit of bid lately, maybe Gross's fund will finally see flows turn around. FREE AppDownload
