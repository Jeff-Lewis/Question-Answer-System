APMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella.Microsoft reported its Q2 2014 earnings Tuesday afternoon. Here's the score: Revenue: $23.38 billion vs. $23 billion expected. EPS (GAAP): $0.55 vs. $0.60 expected. It was a miss on EPS, which Microsoft says is due to the Nokia acquisition. Microsoft says the Nokia acquisition accounted for a $0.08 per share loss. When Microsoft gave guidance last quarter, it didn't account for the Nokia acquisition. Bing search ad revenue is up 40%, and Microsoft says it now has 19.2% of the U.S. search market share. Microsoft added 1 million consumer subscribers to Office 365, its subscription Office service, last quarter. It now has more than 5.6 million subscribers. Big number: Cloud revenue is booming. It's up 147% and it's on an annualized run rate of more than $4.4 billion. This includes all of Microsoft's cloud businesses like Office 365, Azure, etc. You're going to see Microsoft bragging about this chart a lot: Microsoft Surface revenue was $409 million. But expect that to be a bit better next earnings report once Microsoft is able to sell its new Surface Pro 3 tablet for a full quarter. Microsoft's head of investor relations Chris Suh told Business Insider in an interview Tuesday that the Surface Pro 3 is selling at a faster rate than the last two Pro models. The stock did nothing in after-hours trading. FREE AppDownload
