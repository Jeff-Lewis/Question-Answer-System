HP just reported its fourth quarter earnings: inline with profits and a miss on revenue. HP reported Q4 earnings per share of $1.06, right in line with expectations and revenue of $28.40 billion, that's a miss. Analysts expected $1.06 earnings per share for the quarter and revenue to be $28.77 billion, down 1.3% over the year-ago quarter. For the year, HP reported net revenue of $111.5 billion, that's another slight miss. Analysts expected the year to finish with $111.74 billion in revenue, nearly flat (down only a .5% from last year). HP beat the non-GAAP full year EPS number by 1 cent. It reported $3.74 when analysts expected $3.73. The company had given guidance of $3.70 to $3.74 per share. This is the first earnings report since HP announced its plans to cleave itself into two public companies in 2015. Revenue was down in just about every business unit. The only bright spot was the PC division, where revenue was up 4% year over year with a 4.0% operating margin, entirely due to businesses finally buying new PCs. Consumer PC revenue was down 2%.
