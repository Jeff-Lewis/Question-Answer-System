Herbalife is arguably one of the most embattled stocks in America as multiple hedge fund titans square off over its future. On one side is Bill Ackman, who released a massive, 342-slide presentation in December arguing that the company was a Ponzi scheme and that shares would go to $0. Ackman describes his hedge fund's short position in Herbalife as "enormous." On the other side are activist investor Carl Icahn and hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, who both decided to invest in the stock after Ackman went public with his short call. FREE AppDownload
