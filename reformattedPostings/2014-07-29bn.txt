Flick/danielmorrisMany young Wall Streeters were freaking out Tuesday morning because the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level I and II results were coming out.  The CFA Institute said they would send the results at 9 a.m. ET. The CFA Institute's website was down when we last checked.    For the June test-takers, 42% passed Level I and 46% passed Level 2, the CFA Institute tweeted. That's a higher pass rate than usual, but most folks still failed.  Consisting of three levels, the CFA program is considered to be the hardest series of exams in finance. Fewer than 20% of candidates pass all three tests on the first attempt. The average CFA candidate takes four years to complete the program.   The average test-taker also spends about six months preparing, putting in about 20 hours a week to study the exam materials. For those who passed, you can see they're really excited. Congrats guys!  Stick a fork in level 1! Level 2 here I come! #cfaresults #cfa Passing level 1 got me like: #cfaresults http://t.co/m13ls5Pjfb Through!
