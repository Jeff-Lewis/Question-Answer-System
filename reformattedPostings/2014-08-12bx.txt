Dr. Ed's BlogThe latest earnings season is almost over, with 91% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported their Q2 2014 results. The latest blend of actual and estimated earnings shows a growth rate of 9.6% year-over-year. That’s up from the low of 5.9% at the start of the earnings season during the week of July 10. It is also up from the first quarter’s growth rate of 5.3%. The solid gain isn’t surprising given the 6.0% (saar) growth in nominal GDP during the second quarter. It was up 4.1% on a y/y basis. What is surprising is the gain during the first quarter, when nominal GDP fell 0.8% (saar). However, it was still up 3.3% y/y. S&amp;P 500 revenues are driven by global nominal GDP, with the U.S. accounting for a significant portion of that total, of course. S&amp;P 500 forward revenues rose to a new record high at the end of July. Forward earnings rose to record highs yet again last week for the S&amp;P 500/400/600. For the S&amp;P 500, forward earnings was $128.22; it is converging toward the 2015 consensus estimate of $133.69 (as of last week), which has been edging higher recently.
