REUTERS/Richard ClementPending home sales fell 0.8% month-over-month in February. This was the eighth consecutive monthly fall. On the year, pending home sales were down 10.2% on the year.

This compares to an initial reading of 0.1% month-over-month rise and a 9.1% YoY fall. "Contract signings for the past three months have been little changed, implying the market appears to be stabilizing,” Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist said in a press release. "Moreover, buyer traffic information from our monthly Realtor survey shows a modest turnaround, and some weather delayed transactions should close in the spring."

He doesn't think we've seen the bottom in declining sales and worries that a spike in mortgage rates could inflict more pain. The Commerce Department expects that 80% of signings will become existing home sales transactions within two months.
