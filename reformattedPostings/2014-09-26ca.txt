PIMCO / YouTubeBill Gross.CNBC's David Faber reports that PIMCO was going to fire Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross on Saturday because of "increasingly erratic behavior." The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that PIMCO was going to fire Gross before he resigned.  It appears that the billionaire bond god made his move first.   Gross, 70, announced Friday morning that he was leaving the firm he cofounded effective immediately. He's joining Janus Capital, where he'll run a newly created bond fund. Shares of Janus surged on the announcement.  According to Faber, PIMCO employees had said that they would leave PIMCO is Gross didn't go.  PIMCO said in a statement that the firm's leadership and Gross had "fundamental differences."  "While we are grateful for everything Bill contributed to building our firm and delivering value to PIMCO’s clients," the firm said, "over the course of this year it became increasingly clear that the firm’s leadership and Bill have fundamental differences about how to take PIMCO forward." Earlier this year, Gross was the subject of an incredibly unflattering Wall Street Journal article.  The inside account detailed how Gross clashed with Mohamed El-Erian in front of the other employees. El-Erian, PIMCO's CEO/co-CIO, resigned from PIMCO in January.  Sources also told The Journal that Gross referred to himself as "Secretariat," the legendary racehorse. The article also said that Gross didn't like it when his traders made eye contact with or spoke to him.  PIMCO was to release a succession plan later Friday.  FREE AppDownload
