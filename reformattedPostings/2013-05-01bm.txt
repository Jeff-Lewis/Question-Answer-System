Daniel Goodman/Business InsiderThe March reading of U.S. construction spending is out, and it's a big disappointment. Spending fell 1.7% month-over-month. Economists were looking for 0.6% month-over-month gain. It's worth noting February's growth rate was revised up to 1.5% from an earlier reading of 1.2%. March was unseasonably cold, which may have hindered activity.
