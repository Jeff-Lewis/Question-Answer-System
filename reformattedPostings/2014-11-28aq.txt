At one point on Friday, WTI futures briefly breached $66. Brent crude prices, which are the global benchmark, also cracked $70 a barrel on Friday.  Earlier this week, WTI prices were at around $76 and Brent prices were near $80. The drop in crude prices is a continuation of the collapse that started on Thursday after the latest OPEC meeting saw the oil cartel maintain its current rate of production. Many in the market expected OPEC to announce production cuts to combat the recent decline in oil prices, which some have blamed on too much global supply. On Thursday, WTI prices fell more than 6% to below $70 for the first time since June 2010.

Meanwhile smaller oil producers like Whiting Petroleum, Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas, and Oasis Petroleum all saw shares fall more than 28%.  Here is the insane chart of crude prices over the last 24 hours.
