REUTERS/Miguel VidalThe April personal income and spending numbers are out, and they're mixed. Spending unexpectedly fell by 0.1%, missing estimates for a 0.2% gain. "Spending on goods fell in line with the retail sales numbers, which were hugely distorted by the late Easter," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdwon. "Expect a clear May rebound." Income climbed by 0.3%, which was right in line with expectations. Because income outpaced spending, the personal saving rate climbed to 4.0% from 3.6% a month ago. Core PCE, the Fed's favorite measure of inflation, increased by 0.2% month-over-month in April or 1.4% year-over-year. This was right in line with expectations. Here's a breakdown of what moved up and down during the measuring period. BEA FREE AppDownload
