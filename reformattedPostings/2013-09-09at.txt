Is a 42-year-old serial entrepreneur already the greatest tech god since Steve Jobs? Or maybe ever? Thousands of Quora up-voters think so. And we won’t disagree. Extreme entrepreneurialism is what the digital age enables -- and no one does it better than Elon. Disrupting the money world with PayPal. Launching SpaceX, already NASA’s go-to rocket provider. Building Solar City, the biggest US solar-power installer. Electrifying Tesla Motors -- zero to $20B market cap, already the most transformative car maker since Henry Ford rolled out his Model T. Oh, and almost forgot: in his spare time, re-imagining LA-SF as a half-hour trip by hyperloop. All that and more is why Elon will be headlining IGNITION: Future of Digital, BI's flagship event November 11-13 at New York’s Time Warner Center. For a full hour he’ll be talking with BI Editor-in-Chief Henry Blodget, as well as taking questions from the audience. They’ll also talk money. They’ll talk talent, design, and management. They’ll talk about how ever-smarter software pushing ever more powerful hardware will continue rocking the planet (and maybe a few others topics). And we'll have test drives of the Tesla Model S -- hands-down winner as both the best and most transformative car in the world. For a preview of what you can expect in November, check out the latest IGNITION 2013 line-up. And reserve your spot now before early-bird rates expire!  P.S.
