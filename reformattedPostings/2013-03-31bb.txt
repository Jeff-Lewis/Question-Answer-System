Russia Beyond The Headlines/Sergei SmirnovRussia is the world's fourth largest gold producer, and Kolyma in the far north-east of Russia is one of the regions most flush with gold.  During Stalin's rule, prisoners of the Gulag were sent to Kolyma and forced to mine for gold, which was desperately needed to finance economic development. Now, many of those in the region choose to mine for gold. The miner settlements have however been decreasing since the 1990s.   Russia Beyond The Headlines (RBTH) and photographer Sergei Smirnov put together a feature giving us insight into gold mining in Kolyma.
