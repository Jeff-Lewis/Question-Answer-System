I often receive questions on which color shoes to wear with which color pants. None of the questions are bad questions; sometimes it is hard to tell if things work together. So I have decided to make a chart to try to help all of us out. I hope the chart is easy to understand. On the left we have the pant color and the right, the shoe color. If you can wear a given color of shoe with a color of pants, the color is present. If you cannot, ‘NO’ will be present. The Fine Young Gentlemen  Now, obviously, there are exceptions to everything. Sometimes certain shades of burgundy won’t go with burgundy pants, or the grays and browns just won’t mix. So this is only to act as a general guide and not as law, for it is mostly a subjective view on what I have seen done well and not well over the past few years. I should note that some of you may disagree with some of the approved and not approved combinations, such as my lack of support for tan pants and black shoes. Disagree all you want, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen the pairing done well. Anyway, you should get the idea by now.
