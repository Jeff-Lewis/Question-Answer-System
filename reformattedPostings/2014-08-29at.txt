CorcoranNice, but worth $300,000!?A family from the midwest dropped an eye-popping $300,000 to rent a mansion in Bridgehampton for a single week this summer, The New York Post reports. That's a new Hamptons rental record, according to the post. The home, dubbed the "Sandcastle" in Bridgehampton, has made headlines before. Jay Z and Beyoncé reportedly spent $400,000 to rent it for a month in August 2012. The Sandcastle was built by well-known Hamptons homebuilder Joe Farrell, and has a movie theater, bowling alley, walk-in refrigerator, wine room, climbing wall, basketball court, private gym, and spa. Still, $300,000 is a ton of money for a week's vacation. Gary DePersia at Corcoran has the rental listing. Callie Bost contributed to this story. FREE AppDownload
