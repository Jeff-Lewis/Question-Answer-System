Silicon Valley may still lead in pure tech, but when Marissa Mayer needed a defining acquisition for Yahoo!, the Big Apple is where she went shopping. That's why New York will be back again as host city for IGNITION: Future of Digital, Business Insider’s flagship event on November 11-13. For the fourth year running, we're gathering 700 senior executives from the converging worlds of technology, media, marketing, entertainment, investing, and finance. They will converge at the Time Warner Center overlooking Central Park. Their mission will be to explore the ongoing explosion of new business models being fueled by digital technology and the Internet. At IGNITION we discuss innovation that matters--who wins, who loses, and what you and your company can do to keep ahead. A few of the topics we’re working on: For a taste of what you can expect in November, check out the latest IGNITION 2013 line-up, or the full agendas from our previous events.
