Screenshot.The tolerant Mr. Fischer.As some Americans celebrate the step toward fairness and equality in the Supreme Court's ruling that it's unconstitutional to deny federal benefits to gay spouses, other Americans are furious. Bryan J. Fischer, for example, who is the Director Of Issue Analysis at an organization that calls itself the American Family Association, thinks that the ruling makes it "inevitable" that everyone will soon be having sex with relatives, kids, and pets. The DOMA ruling has now made the normalization of polygamy, pedophilia, incest and bestiality inevitable. Matter of time. FOX News contributor Todd Starnes, for example, is merely accusing the Supreme Court of "overruling God" and suggesting that Christians ignore the decision and "answer to a higher court." What's curious about this position is that there's nothing preventing Christians (or anyone else) making their own decisions on this matter. That's what "freedom" and "separation of church and state" are all about.  You can read the rest of Mr. Fischer's analysis here &gt; FREE AppDownload
