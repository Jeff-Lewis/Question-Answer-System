Melia Robinson/Business InsiderYou'll have to get up at the crack of dawn to take part in Silicon Alley's hottest new party. Daybreaker is an event created by General Assembly co-founder Matthew Brimer and Super Sprowtz founder and CEO Radha Agrawal — and it gets going early. Starting at 7 a.m., young professionals gather to dance, network, and have a good time. For those looking for an even earlier start, yoga with Lululemon starts at 6 a.m. The party takes place at hot night clubs around New York City, but there's a strict policy against illicit substances. "It's a great way to start the day off with a bang, and without alcohol," Brimer said to Business Insider. "It's very much a workout." The hosts' techie friends are taking note, too. Brimer and Agrawal say that New York City-based startups have been well-represented at past Daybreaker events: Soundcloud, Shutterstock, Flavorpill, and Thrillist, to name a few.  "What's exciting about Daybreaker is that it fosters this community where entrepreneurs can be creative," Brimer said. "So there's the physical aspect, but also the social energy, open-minded, and artistic side to it."  Business Insider attended a recent Daybreaker event to see what the hype is all about.
