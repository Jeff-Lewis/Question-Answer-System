The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price moves. The RSI moves between zero and 100 and is considered overbought with a reading above 70 and oversold when below 30.  Note the RSI can sustain an overbought (oversold) reading in a strong up (down) trend.
