I was lucky enough to see the Radio City Christmas Spectacular last night for the first time. The show, of course, stars the Rockettes. It's alot of fun. I shot a video from my seat using the iPhone 6 new slo-mo feature. Take a look. Produced by Justin Maiman. Edited by Sam Rega. Follow BI Video: On Facebook
