 Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Today, the CEOs of New York City's 200 leading companies - all members of the Partnership for New York City - sent an urgent letter to House Republican Leadership asking them "to quickly pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act (TRIA)." TRIA was originally passed in 2002 in the wake of 9/11, and exists to "provide a federal backstop for insurance coverage in the event of catastrophic losses from terrorist attacks." In other words, the bill was designed to help employers and insurers to appropriately manage terrorism risk. As it stands, TRIA is set to expire in December 2014. On July 17, the Senate passed a version of a TRIA reauthorization 93-4 in a display of overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle. The Senate's renewal bill extends TRIA for an additional seven years, and was first brought to the floor by Sen. Schumer (NY) in April. The House currently has its own version of the TRIA extension, which only proposes to extend the bill for five years.  The Partnership for New York City's letter cites the U.S.'s "vulnerable[ility] to international terrorism" and urges the House to "act swiftly to pass a bill that maintains a program structure that has proven effective and has had no cost to the federal taxpayer." It was signed by executives from a wide array of industries. Some of the signatories included: fashion designer Tory Burch, media mogul Barry Diller, American Express CEO Kenneth I. Chenault, Viacom Inc. President and CEO Philippe Dauman, and billionaire John Catsimatidis.  The House is set to vote on the Senate's version of the bill in coming weeks. Here is the full text of the letter: July 22, 2014 Honorable John Boehner (R-OH) Speaker of the HouseHonorable Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) Majority WhipHonorable Steve Scalise (R-LA) Majority Whip-ElectDear Representatives Boehner, McCarthy, and Scalise,We write to urge the House of Representatives to quickly pass theTerrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act (TRIA).  America remainsvulnerable to international terrorism. “TRIA” is one of the 21stCentury tools that we rely upon to protect American jobs and allowinvestment to continue, despite the risk of terrorism. With the sunsetof this federal program coming up in December, it is already difficultto renew insurance along the lines required by employers and propertyowners in urban centers. The bill that passed in the Senate last week with overwhelming,bipartisan support provides the federal backstop necessary to allowinsurers, employers, and property owners to continue to manageterrorism risk. It is important to the business community in New YorkCity and across the nation that the House act swiftly to pass a billthat maintains a program structure that has proven effective and hashad no cost to the federal taxpayer.We want to continue to work with you to keep our economy growing. TRIAis one of the public-private partnership arrangements that makescontinued growth possible. Sincerely- Lee S. Ainslie, III, Managing Partner, Maverick Capital Ajay S.
