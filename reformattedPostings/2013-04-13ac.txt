In case you weren't already convinced that the late Margaret Thatcher was an extremely controversial figure in the U.K., here's video of protesters in London's Trafalgar Square carrying an effigy of Thatcher earlier this afternoon:  Yes, she is dragging a coffin with the word "society" on it. According to the Guardian, there were approximately 1,700 protesters at the scene today, which started at 6 p.m. (1 p.m. EST) and is still ongoing. The event is being heavily policed and there have been some minor scuffles with the crowd. While the protests are largely against Thatcher's economic legacy, they are also attacking contemporary issues — such as austerity cuts from the British government that went into place a few weeks ago.
