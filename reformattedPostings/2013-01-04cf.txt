Dave Gates via FlickrThe U.S. housing market turned the corner in 2012. The latest home price report from Trulia says home prices were up 5.1 percent year-over-year nationally. And the pace of increases has also picked up in the year. With home prices up 0.8 percent quarter-over-quarter in Q1, and up 2.3 percent in Q4. We drew on Trulia's latest report to highlight the top "turnaround markets" of 2012, i.e. markets with the biggest increase in home prices between December 2011 and December 2012. Note: The report looks at the 100 largest metros in the U.S. All price and rent changes are on a year-over-year basis. FREE AppDownload
