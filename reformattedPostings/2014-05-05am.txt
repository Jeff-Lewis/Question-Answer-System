Shares of the stock have fallen more than 7.7% in the after-hours session. He said it's an excellent company and has a great CEO. He doesn't want it to fail. He just thinks it's over-priced. He thinks this stock can fall 80%.  He also said the company isn't positioned to succeed the way the bulls hope.  For more coverage, check out our live blog » FREE AppDownload
