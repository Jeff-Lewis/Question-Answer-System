Warren Buffett's first Tweet... Warren is in the house. Before he actually Tweeted, the famed 82-year-old investor, who doesn't even have a computer on his desk, told Fortune magazine's Pattie Seller that using social media is "pretty daring," but he'll try it. Fortune's Seller asked the "Oracle of Omaha" if he understands Twitter.  He responded with "So-so. Don't give me a quiz!"   "But the co-founder came from Nebraska, so it can't all be bad," he added. His handle @WarrenBuffett already has a blue check mark signifying that it's a verified Twitter account. Right now, he has more than 25,000 followers and that number keeps increasing.  He hasn't started following anyone, yet. Twitter.com/WarrenBuffett FREE AppDownload
