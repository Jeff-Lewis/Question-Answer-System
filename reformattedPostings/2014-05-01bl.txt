T-MobileT-Mobile CEO John Legere(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc said it added 2.4 million net customers in the first quarter, up from 579,000 a year earlier, as the company's aggressive discounts won over customers. The No. 4 U.S. mobile operator's quarterly revenue rose 47 percent to $6.88 billion, boosted by the popularity of a series of discounts and promotions that have disrupted an industry long dominated by the top two players, Verizon and AT&amp;T. The mobile provider, which is 67 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom, lost $151 million, or 19 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $107 million, or 20 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
