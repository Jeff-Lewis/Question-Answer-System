Ireland wants to help CNBC's Joe Kernen and any other journalist who might be confused by the country's political system. According to the New York Post, the country's government has announced a free expansion of its educational program for those abroad interested in business in Ireland. It's called the Irish Executive Mentoring Program, and a spokesman told The Post that Kernen should definitely apply. This comes after a disastrous live interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when host Kernen seemed perplexed to find out that Ireland was part of the EU. Kernen was interviewing Martin Shanahan of Ireland’s Industrial Development Authority (IDA). Cohost Becky Quick asked Shanahan how a weaker euro was affecting Irish tourism; Kernen thought Ireland was still using the pound. Joe Kernen: You have pounds anyway, don't you still? Martin Shanahan: We have euros. JK: You have euros in Ireland? Why do you have euros in Ireland?  MT: Why wouldn't we have euros? JK: I'd use the pound. Ireland entered the euro in 1999. So it's been a while. The exchange went on, and Kernen continued to show a not quite nuanced understanding of Ireland's history. Quick and cohost Andrew Ross Sorkin sat in silence, doubtless wishing that the earth would open up and eat them: JK: What about Scotland? I was using Scottish ... er ...  MT: Scottish pounds. They use sterling. But we use euro. JK: What? MT: Why wouldn't we do that?  JK: Why didn't Scotland? MT: Well, they're part of the UK and we're not.
