On a comparable store basis, sales grew 5.8% during the quarter. GameStop's second quarter and full year profit outlooks were also in-line with estimates, and the company said it expects full year sales, on a comparable store basis, to grow 6% to 12%.  GameStop said new software sales fell 20% during the quarter, owing to fewer 'AAA' titles being released than during the prior year period.  Shares of GameStop, which gained 100% during 2013, are down 25% year-to-date. The stock is one of the most heavily shorted among companies with a market cap larger than $2 billion, according to data from Finviz.  Shares of GameStop, which were up as much as 7% following the report, are currently up 2.5%.
