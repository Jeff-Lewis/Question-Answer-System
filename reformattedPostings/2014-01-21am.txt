More than 2,900 flights into, out of, and within the U.S. have been cancelled today, as the Northeast braces for another wave of freezing weather and heavy snow. More than 30% of flights into and out of LaGuardia, JFK, Newark, Philadelphia, Reagan National, Washington Dulles, and Baltimore airports have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com. Nearly 1,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Wednesday have already been cancelled. Several airlines have already waived fees for passengers who want to change their reservations. JetBlue's COO warned on Twitter that the airline, which runs most of its flights through New York or Boston, is preparing to scale down its operations for today and tomorrow: Our plan for Tues/Weds: major thinning to our ops in NY/BOS and other northeast airports beginning this eve thru tomorrow morning. JetBlue was criticized earlier this month when it left passengers stranded for days in the Caribbean without flights home. It has cancelled nearly 30% of its flights for today, and 21% of its flights for Wednesday. AirTrain service to JFK has been suspended and replaced with free shuttle buses, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
