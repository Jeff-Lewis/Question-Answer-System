BofA closes its long-Treasuries trade. "We recommended initiating tactical longs in the 5y (old 5s, T 1.5 08/31/2018) on Monday 09/23. We believed that increasing concerns about a shutdown, dovish Fed speak, a likely Yellen nomination, technical indicators and stretched short positioning were likely to lead to a near term rally in rates.  "This view has largely been realized over the last week with market concerns of a shutdown increasing and dovish Fed speak (Dudley and Evans) leading to likely capitulation of shorts. While shutdown risks remain high and a modest rally is still possible, the risk reward to outright longs seems more balanced at current levels, in our view. "We recommended buying $100m 5y notes (T 1.5% 08/31/2018) at 1.45%. We close the trade at a current yield level of 1.365%."—Priya Misra, BofA Merrill Lynch FREE AppDownload
