Everyone knows the commodities supercycle is coming to an end as a result of slowing demand in China.  In a new note, Deutsche Bank's Taimur Baig and Jun Ma zero in specifically on the implications for declining global oil demand.  We just saw its (declining) prospects in BP's statistical energy review last week. Baig and Ma say global oil supply is likely to outstrip global demand for the rest of the decade, thanks to the U.S. shale boom — which is also poised to go global (China has some of the world's largest shale deposits) — and refining capacity that's about to come online. As a result, oil prices are going to be severely dampened in the years to come.
