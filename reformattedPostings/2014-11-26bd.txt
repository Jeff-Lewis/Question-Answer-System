Wonderlane/FlickrThe pace of new home sales climbed 0.7% in October to an annualized pace of 458,000 units. Economists had forecast a pace of 471,000 units. "Although there has been significant volatility in this series, it appears to have fluctuated around the 400k-450k range for most of the past two years, indicating a stabilization in new home sales at these levels," Barclays' Blerina Uruçi said. "We expect a gradual increase in sales next year to be supported by improving demand as employment and earnings growth picks up." Sales climbed 7.1% in the Northeast and surged 15.8% in the Midwest. They declined in the South and the West. The median new home sales price during the month was $305,000. According to the Census, there were 212,000 new houses for sale, which represents a 5.6 month supply. FREE AppDownload
