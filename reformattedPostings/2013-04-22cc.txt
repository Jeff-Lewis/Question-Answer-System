Global economic bellwether Caterpillar just announced Q1 revenue and earnings that fell short of analysts expectations.  Management also reduced its guidance for the year. Because CAT is so closely tied to the economy, it has unparalleled insight into what's really going on.

Here are a few key points: Here's Caterpillar's full economic outlook:---------------------------------------------------------- 2013 Economic Outlook Our expectation for world economic growth is about the same as the outlook included with our year-end 2012 financial results. We anticipate overall world economic growth of about 2.5 percent—a small improvement from 2.3 percent in 2012. Purchasing manager indicators improved in the first quarter, and industrial production increased in the majority of countries. Both indicate that world economic growth is benefiting from monetary easing that started 19 months ago. Central banks continued easing in the first quarter, and we expect the world economy will continue to improve in 2013.
