flickr/argenbergCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is planning to build a new Suez Canal alongside the near-145 year-old historic waterway in a multi-billion dollar project aimed at expanding trade along the fastest shipping route betweenEurope and Asia. The new canal is expected to cost $4 billion, Mohab Mamishm, the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority said on Tuesday during a conference broadcast by state television. "This giant project will be the creation of a new Suez Canal parallel to the current channel of a total length of 72 kilometres (44.74 miles)," Mohab Mamish, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, told the conference in Ismailia, a port town on the Canal.  The current Suez Canal brings in around $5 billion of revenues per year, a vital source of hard currency forEgypt which has suffered a slump in tourism and foreign investment since its 2011 uprising. To attract more ships and generate more income, the country has had plans to develop 76,000 square kilometres (29,000 square miles) around the canal for years. Mamish spoke at a conference in which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to announce a winning consortium to develop the project, which includes building an international industrial and logistics hub in theSuez Canal area. Mamish said the project would involve 35 kilometres ( miles) of "dry digging" and 37 kilometres ( miles) would be "expansion and deepening", indicating the current Suez Canal, which is 163 km (101 miles) long, could be widened as part of the project.
