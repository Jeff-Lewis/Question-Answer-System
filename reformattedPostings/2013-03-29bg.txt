North Korea is making more noise. Following the deployment of U.S. B-2s to South Korea, North Korean President Kim Jong-un has ordered his military to be on alert for a strike against the US. As part of the warning, North Korea has published two new images in a local paper (via Reuters) and what people are noticing is the background, which appear to show a missile strike plan on the US. In this first one, the map of the U.S. is most vivid. Here's the full picture.

The text apparently reads "U.S. Mainland Strike Plan" (which is not subtle). The four cities that are targeted are Austin, San Diego, Honolulu, and Washington DC.

REUTERS/KCNA A key thing as NKNews.org points out is that the photos were released in a domestic workers paper, implying that the images are for internal consumption, rather than a real threat.
