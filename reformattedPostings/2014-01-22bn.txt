For most finance novices, the language of mutual funds can be a mix of daunting, impressive, and suspicious. Every style of mutual fund offers something a bit different. But their explanations are often lacking and confusing. Enter Josh Brown, aka The Reformed Broker, with his mutual fund brochure decoder. In it Brown makes a less-than-serious effort to translate some of the jargon mutual fund clients are confronted by. More often then not, a typical actively managed mutual fund will do worse than a generic index fund, which cheaply replicates the performance of a major benchmark like the S&amp;P 500. It appears it's for this reason that Brown employs a snarky tone with all of these alternative styles. Check it out: @ReformedBroker FREE AppDownload
