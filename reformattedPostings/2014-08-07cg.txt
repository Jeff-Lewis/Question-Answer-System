Russia is specifically banning all beef, pork, fruit, vegetable, dairy, cheese, and fish imports from the U.S. and the EU. The ban will last one year from Thursday. The announcement was made by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow, reports Bloomberg's Olga Tanas. "There is nothing good in sanctions and it wasn't an easy decision to take, but we had to do it," Medvedev said. In recent weeks, the U.S. and the EU introduced a series of economic sanctions against Russia for its involvement in destabilizing Ukraine. Sanctions were targeted at financial and energy firms. Medvedev said Russian food producers would step up to supply the market.
