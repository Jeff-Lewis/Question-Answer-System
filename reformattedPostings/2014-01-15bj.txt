The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing survey surged to 12.51. That's the highest reading since May 2012. Consensus was for a reading of 3.50. December was revised higher, to 2.22 from 0.98. The index for expected number of employees rose to 20.7, and the future average workweek  index climbed to 9.8. The index  for future general business conditions was little changed at 37.5, but the index for future new orders climbed nine points to 39.1. The index for future prices paid fell three points to 45.1, and the index for future prices received fell to 23.2. Barclays' Cooper Howes commented: "Despite the positive headline readings in recent months, the underlying trend had been softer; on an ISM-adjusted basis, which re-weights each component using the same weights as the manufacturing ISM, the index printed 47.2 in December and 49.3 in November. This trend reversed in January, however, as the new orders (11.0, previous: -1.7), shipments (15.5, previous: 4.7), and employment (12.2, previous: 0.0) indices now all stand firmly in positive territory. These improvements resulted in an ISM-adjusted print of 53.3 in January, the highest since May 2012. While some of the notable components have been volatile in recent months (Figure 1), we expect the index to remain in positive territory in the coming months as manufacturing activity continues to pick up." We've now been in positive territory — meaning manufacturing activity has been expanding — for about a year: New York Fed Full report »  FREE AppDownload
