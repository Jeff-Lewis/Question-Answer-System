Seven of the eight indexes in my international focus group posted losses over the past week. The average of the eight came in at -1.43%, the worst collective performance since the week that ended on June 14th. The amazing Nikkei recorded the sole advance, up a modest 0.67%. After three weeks as the top performer, the Mumbai SENSEX came in a distant second, with a loss of 1.34%. The third-place S&amp;P 500 (also third last week) declined 1.69%. The range of losses for the other five indexes was fairly narrow, from the CAC 40’s -1.69% to the Hang Seng’s -2.09%. The Shanghai Composite remains the only index on the watch list in bear territory -- the traditional designation for a 20% decline from an interim high. See the table inset (lower right) in the chart below. The index is down 36.74% from its interim high of August 2009. At the other end, the S&amp;P 500 remains in the top spot, 1.83% off its all-time high, and the Nikkei is off only 2.20% from its interim closing high of December 3rd. Here is snapshot of the YTD performances, with the volatile Nikkei as the ongoing attention-grabber.  Here is a table highlighting the 2013 year-to-date gains, sorted in that order, along with the 2013 interim highs for the eight indexes. The performance of the Japan's Nikkei, despite its volatility, puts it solidly in the top spot, up 48.18%. Only the Shanghai Composite is stuck in the red YTD. A Closer Look at the Last Four Weeks The tables below provide a concise overview of performance comparisons over the past four weeks for these eight major indexes. I've also included the average for each week so that we can evaluate the performance of a specific index relative to the overall mean and better understand weekly volatility. The colors for each index name help us visualize the comparative performance over time.   The chart below illustrates the comparative performance of World Markets since March 9, 2009. The start date is arbitrary: The S&amp;P 500, CAC 40 and BSE SENSEX hit their lows on March 9th, the Nikkei 225 on March 10th, the DAX on March 6th, the FTSE on March 3rd, the Shanghai Composite on November 4, 2008, and the Hang Seng even earlier on October 27, 2008. However, by aligning on the same day and measuring the percent change, we get a better sense of the relative performance than if we align the lows.

The relative over-performance of the emerging markets (Shanghai, Mumbai SENSEX and Hang Seng) up to their 2007 peaks is evident, and the SENSEX remains by far the top performer. The Shanghai, in contrast, formed a perfect Eiffel Tower from late 2006 to late 2009.
