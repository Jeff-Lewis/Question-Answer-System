REUTERS/Brendan McDermidTwitter shares are up a mind-boggling 28% in the wake of its earnings announcement. This is no joke for a company with a massive $22 billion market cap. The company's Q2 financial results beat expectations across the board. Revenue surged to $312 million, beating expectations for $283.9 million. Monthly active users jumped to 271 million, beating expectations for 267 million. And amid all this, the company squeezed out an adjusted profit of $0.02 per share. Analysts were looking for a $0.01 loss. Twitter closed at $38.59 today after rallying 1.7% during the U.S. trading session. Currently, shares are hovering at around $49. But the stock is far from its all-time high of $74.73, which is saw in December. Here's the after-hours action via MarketWatch.com. MarketWatch FREE AppDownload
