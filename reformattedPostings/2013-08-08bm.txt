In a quarterly regulatory filing, the bank said a civil division of the US attorney's office has "preliminarily concluded" that JPM violated federal laws when it hawked subprime securities from 2005 to 2007. There's also a parallel criminal inquiry "in a more preliminary stage," according to DealBook. A representative from JPMorgan declined to comment. Another massive problem for JPM here is that the Justice Department is piling onto a bunch of other probes. Attorneys General and prosecutors in California, New York, and Pennsylvania are all carrying out their own investigations. The move comes at a time when the Obama administration is ratcheting up efforts to bring America's banks to court over dangerous practices during the run-up to the financial crisis. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and the SEC accused JPM's contemporary, Bank of America, of similar transgressions — exaggerating the quality of the mortgage loan pool backing $850 million in securities. JPM, the largest U.S. bank by assets, recently ran afoul of energy regulators over alleged market manipulation. The bank agreed to a $410 million settlement. FREE AppDownload
