Fab, the online fashion and design retail site that is undergoing a wrenching change in its business strategy, will lay off 50 more people according to AllThingsD. The company gave Business Insider this statement: We haven't announced any layoffs. It is accurate that Fab is undergoing management changes as we realign the business to execute on our 2014-2017 plan. There will be a number of management changes involved as we streamline the organization and move to a category P&amp;L based structure. As not all of the organizational changes are final yet, we are withholding comment on any specific individuals until later this week. Little of the news coming out of Fab these days is good. The company, which once had around 700 employees, now has about 390 by our count. Here's the one piece of good news sustaining the company right now: Earlier this year, it raised $165 million in new investment this year alone, for a total of $336 million in all venture funding. So the company is not imminently going out of business. But that money came as the company changed strategy, from a "flash sales" daily deal model to a more traditional online retail model. That change has been accompanied by these less than upbeat moves: Fab was at one time valued at $1 billion. We'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether these moves will leave the company poised to meet that estimation — or otherwise. FREE AppDownload
