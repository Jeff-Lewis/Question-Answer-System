Saint Venus Theater, MyspaceThe latest Wall Street secret to bubble up to the surface is Saint Venus Theater, the secret roving strip club that was created just for bankers. The New York Post did a big story on the underground, application-based, members-only strip club yesterday. It was started three years ago by a mysterious man named Rob S. for his finance buddies. The main draw of Saint Venus Theater for its members is that the girls are amateurs. They're seen as good girls because they have day jobs such as internships at fashion startups and assistant positions at galleries, but they strip at night to make some extra cash.  SVT meets three times a week in secret locations throughout New York City disclosed only to its members via a private email list. Business Insider obtained a copy of SVT's discreet e-mail list to get a look at how the entire business operates. It's posted below, but before you dig in (the e-mail does say read everything, after all) here are some sections that caught our attention.
