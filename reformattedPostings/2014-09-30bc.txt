REUTERS/Jim Urquhart Jason Williams was a money manager at PIMCO. Then he got fired. Then he sued the firm, dropped the suit, moved to Montana and bought a bar. According to a new report from Bloomberg's Mary Childs and Greg Farrell, Williams was fired by PIMCO in March 2012, three weeks after Williams reportedly told PIMCO he had spoken to US officials regarding what he believed was price manipulation in the company's Total Return ETF. Last week, reports surfaced that the SEC was looking into manipulation in this fund.  This inquiry is reportedly focused on whether or not the fund bought small lots of bonds at a discount and then marked up the price of these holdings in the fund, goosing returns. Bloomberg's report said it couldn't be known if there was a link between Williams' suit and the SEC's inquiry.  Williams left the industry and when reached by Bloomberg declined to comment on why he dropped the suit.  (via Bloomberg) FREE AppDownload
