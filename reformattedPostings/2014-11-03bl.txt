APRichard Branson's Virgin America airline announced today in an SEC filing that it is planning to raise up to $368 million in its IPO.  This news comes just days after a fatal crash that killed one Virgin Galactic test pilot and injured another. Virgin Galactic and Virgin America are owned by the same parent company, Virgin Group. Virgin Galactic is the experimental space tourism arm. It's possible that the filing went ahead before the fatal crash on Friday, and the SEC declined the company's request to pull the paperwork. Alternatively, Virgin could be hoping to move past the crash and raise money. Editor's Note: Earlier, there was erroneous reporting that a Virgin Galactic IPO was occurring. Virgin America is owned by Virgin Group, which also own Virgin Galactic. FREE AppDownload
