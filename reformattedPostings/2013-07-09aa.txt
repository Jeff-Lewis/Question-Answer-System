China's new leadership has been rolling out strict economic policy reforms and they have pushed efforts to rebalance its economy. Meanwhile, credit markets have been tightening, and China's central bank has offered little relief.  All of this comes as weak global growth has slowed demand for Chinese goods. And as a result of all of this, China is slowing. This is bad for news for the U.S. which counts China as its third biggest export market. A report from the US-China Business Council (USCBC) shows that U.S. exports to China grew 294% from 2003 - 2012. This compares with an 111% increase in U.S. exports to the rest of world for the same period. Exports to China have increased from $16.2 billion in 2000, to $108.6 billion last year. We put together a list of the top 15 U.S. state exporters to China in the past decade. Crops, computer and electronics, chemicals, transportation equipment, and machinery (ex-electrical) were the five biggest exports. FREE AppDownload
