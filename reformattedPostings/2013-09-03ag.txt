I think it's probably safe to say that Matt Drudge—he of the eponymously named Drudge Report—is less than pleased with the news that House GOP leaders are slowly lining up behind President Obama's plan for "limited" military intervention in Syria.  Why would anyone vote Republican? Please give reason. Raised taxes; marching us off to war again; approved more NSA snooping. WHO ARE THEY?! It's now Authoritarian vs. Libertarian. Since Democrats vs. Republicans has been obliterated, no real difference between parties...
