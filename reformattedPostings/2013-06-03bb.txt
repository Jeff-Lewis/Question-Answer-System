via Kendra Todd GroupRussian fertilizer tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev plans to level the $95 million Palm Beach property he bought from Donald Trump in 2008 because of mold problems, Gossip Extra reported. The sale of the 33,000-square-foot property, dubbed Maison de L’Amitie, was the highest ever for a single-family home, netting Trump a more than $50 million profit, according to the site. Mold has become a “Wal-Mart-size problem,” Gossip Extra wrote. “I don’t care about the house,” Trump told Gossip Extra. “I bought it for $41 million, put in $3 worth of paint and gave it a good cleaning — and I sold it for the highest price ever for a single family home. I don’t know what he wants to do with it, and I couldn’t care less,” he said. Rybolovlev, the billionaire owner of the A.S. Monaco Football Club, could chop up the 6.26-acre property, which includes a 475-foot-long beach, into as many as a dozen beachfront lots, the site said, citing an unnamed source. [Gossip Extra] More from The Real Deal: 1. South Beach Setai $8.6M condo sale sets record2. Morgans fighting bad deal it made in recession3. High-end home sales smash records as South Florida market catches fire FREE AppDownload
