AP Photo/The Dallas Morning News, Kye R. Lee, PoolPresident Barack Obama in July Obama mentioned his credit-card issue on Friday when he spoke while signing an executive order aimed at protecting people from credit-card fraud. He said his card was rejected when he was having a dinner date with his wife, Michelle Obama, in Manhattan during the UN General Assembly. "It turned out, I guess, I don't use it enough, to so they thought there was some fraud going on," said Obama. "Fortunately, Michelle had hers." Obama and the first lady dined at New York City restaurant Estela on Sept. 24 while he attended the annual UN meeting. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether this was the meal where his card was rejected. In July, a White House press pool report described Obama using his "JPMorgan card" at a barbecue restaurant in Austin, Texas. According to the report, before using the card, Obama asked an aide if it was good. He was assured it was and apparently used it without incident.   Business Insider reached out to JPMorgan to ask why Obama's card may have been shut off. A company spokesman declined to discuss the matter and said the company does not "comment on customers' accounts." This isn't the only recent issue with Obama's credit card. Earlier this month, a JPMorgan SEC filing revealed the company suffered a massive cyberattack where personal information from tens of million customers may have been "compromised." The company declined to comment about whether Obama was among users who may have been affected.   FREE AppDownload
