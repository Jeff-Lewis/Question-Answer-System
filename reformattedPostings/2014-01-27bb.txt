David Ogilvy & Associates RealtorsLast May, a Connecticut mansion went on the market for $190 million and became the most expensive home for sale in the U.S. Now, that price tag has been reduced to $130 million, meaning the property — Greenwich's Copper Beech Farm — no longer holds that title, according to Curbed (an estate in Dallas remains on the market for $135 million). The 50-acre property dates back to the 1890s, and is currently owned by timber magnate John Rudey. It carries a reported $120 million in debt, likely accounting for the sky-high initial sale price. The 12-bedroom home has 15,000 square feet of living space, 7,000 square feet of basement and attic space, and an 1,800-foot-long driveway. There's also a grass tennis court, innumerable gardens, apple orchard, greenhouses, 75-foot-long heated pool, and a carriage house. The estate is currently listed with Christie's International Real Estate and David Ogilvy &amp; Associates. FREE AppDownload
