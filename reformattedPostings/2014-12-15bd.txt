REUTERSStocks have given it all back, and now the losses are accelerating. Near 11:30 am ET, the Dow was down 100 points, the S&amp;P 500 was down 12 points, and the Nasdaq was down 45 points. Earlier in the morning, stocks opened higher with the Dow briefly trading above 100 points. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 is back below the 2,000 level for the first time since Halloween.  And on Twitter, some have noted that the S&amp;P 500 is now approaching a key technical level at its 100-day moving average of 1,988. The early drop in stocks comes after what was the Dow's worst week in three years last week.  Crude oil futures were also paring some of their gains from earlier in the session, as West Texas Intermediate crude was back near $57 a barrel. On Sunday night, WTI opened sharply lower, but made its way back to above $58 overnight but is softening some on Monday morning. The biggest move on Monday was coming out of Russia, where the ruble was again making new lows against the dollar, crashing through 60 against the dollar to 62, a new record.  Stateside, we got a mixed bag of economic data on Monday morning. The Empire State manufacturing report from the New York Fed disappointed, going negative for the first time since January 2013.  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's latest report on industrial production blew away expectations, as production rose 1.3% in November against expectations for a 0.7% increase.  Homebuilder sentiment missed expectations, with the NAHB housing market index falling to 57 in December from 58 last month.  FREE AppDownload
