AP ImagesWarren BuffettNo, Buffett and Co. are not jumping into the production or distribution of marijuana, but they are trying to help those already in those lines of work. Cubic Designs Inc., a small, Wisconsin-based subsidiary of Berkshire specializing in the development and installation of “free-standing structures that add needed space to…facilities,” has reached out to over 1,000 Colorado and Washington pot dispensaries in an effort to help them maximize their functional space for growing and harvesting marijuana. The marketing-friendly fliers feature pictures of pot plants growing in confined spaces with captions reading "Double Your Growing Space" and "Grow Your Profits". As the demand for legal weed increases, growers — already having difficulty keeping up with existing orders — in urban areas like Denver and Seattle are frantically seeking ways to increase production while avoiding rising real estate costs for additional space. It’s exactly that need Cubic Designs hopes to capitalize on with their array of “pre-engineered steel mezzanines and work platforms,” allowing growers to make far better use of their existing production areas.
