Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley's tech analysts and retail analysts came together and published a big presentation on the eCommerce revolution. The Morgan Stanley team expects the eCommerce opportunity – "retail sales disruption" – to get even bigger in the next few years, and says global eCommerce sales could top $1 trillion by 2016. The presentation examines the five disruptive forces sweeping across the industry, breaks out the opportunities by region, highlights stock picks that stand to gain the most, and comes to five conclusions on where eCommerce is likely to go from here.
