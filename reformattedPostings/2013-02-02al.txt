Sotheby'sG2 Partners managing director John de Neufville turned two triplexes (purchased in 2002 for $2 million) into one massive bachelor's pad and sold it for $17.3 million, according to WSJ. Sure it was a great investment, but this place looks really hard to part with. It's huge but that's part of why de Neufville sold it — because he thinks the house is too massive.  From he WSJ, "I didn't feel like I needed to live in a 7,000-square-foot house by myself," Mr. de Neufville said. That means he's said goodbye the hot tub on the roof, the huge gym, the wine-tasting room, 6 bedrooms, five full and two half bathrooms, two kitchens and six working fireplaces. Sothebys' Jeremy and Robin Stein had the listing.
