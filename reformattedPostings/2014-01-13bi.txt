A bunch of mega-foundations just pledged $330 million to help bail out Detroit's retiree pensions and save the city's art collection, according to a release from the Michigan court handling the city's bankruptcy. The Ford Foundation and Knight Foundation will oversee the rescue fund, though the release does not explicitly break down which charities are paying what amounts. Project leaders want to incorporate the fund into Detroit's official bankruptcy settlement with the city's 100,000 creditors. More foundations are expected to pledge additional amounts. There remains dispute about the total pension shortfall. Emergency manager Kevyn Orr has put the number at $3.5 billion, while pension leaders say it's actually less than $700 million.  Either way, Orr had begun getting quotes for the city's prized art collection as a way to help pay down those costs.  But this appears to be a real movement — and it's not just limited to organizations. Dr. Paul Schaap, a millionaire biotech entrepreneur and Detroit-area native, recently pledged $5 million toward the project.  Here's the full release on the fund: Eastern District FREE AppDownload
