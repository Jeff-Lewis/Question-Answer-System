via Robb ReportThe G650 ERSpeed and range are key parameters for those who use business jets, and the new Gulfstream G650ER, which first reached customers ahead of schedule in mid-November, aims to deliver on both. Among the new breed of large-cabin ultralong-range business jets, the extended-range version of the top-of-the-line Gulfstream G650 can carry an extra 4,000 pounds of fuel, thanks to an advanced fuel-quantity monitoring system and other upgrades, increasing the range by 575 miles—enough to cruise 8,600 miles, connecting New York to Hong Kong nonstop or Los Angeles to Melbourne, Australia. The jet can cruise at nearly 600 mph (Mach 0.85). Its nearly 47-foot-long cabin carries over from the G650, with plenty of space for up to 18 passengers. via Robb ReportAmenities include 16 extra-large oval windows, 100 percent fresh air refreshed every two minutes, and a low maximum cabin altitude of about 4,000 feet. Owners can choose from 12 floor plans or create their own custom layout. via Robb ReportGulfstream will continue to sell the original G650, which has been flying since 2012. Current owners of the G650 can have their jets converted to the G650ER at a cost of about $2 million. The G650ER will compete with Bombardier’s Global 8000, expected to start deliveries in 2017, which will have a maximum range over 9,000 miles. The G650ER sells for a starting price of $66.5 million.
