The unemployment rate fell to 5.8% in October — the lowest rate since 2008. But according to the latest small business optimism survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, good labor in America is still in short supply. Forty-five percent of respondents to the latest survey said there were "few or no qualified applicants" for jobs, which is an increase from July's forty-two percent. This number has been continuously trending higher since 2009. Nineteen percent of firms reported actual compensation changes in the past three months, and although this is a slight drop from July and August's 21% and 22% respectively, this number is still much higher than pre-2009, and has been trending upwards since the financial crisis.  While sales are still one of the bigger concerns for small businesses, it's seen a major drop as the 'single most important problem.' The change towards labor quality becoming the most important problem for more employers suggests that economic concerns are shifting from weak demand to tight supply. And this points to higher wages for America's workers. NFIB FREE AppDownload
