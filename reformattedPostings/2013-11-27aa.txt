We forecast a low double-digit gain of 10 – 15% for U.S. stocks in 2014, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index. This forecast for a slightly above-average annual return is rooted in our expectations for high single-digit earnings growth and a modest rise in the PE ratio. Additionally, we expect similar performance for international stocks. An improvement in economic growth to an average 3% pace in 2014 should drive solid profit gains and boost confidence in the durability of growth. Importantly, GDP does not have to be booming to produce solid gains in the stock market, as 2013 can attest. In fact, there is little relationship between the magnitude of GDP growth and stock market performance. Strong GDP can be a sign of an overheating economy that may be due for a recession, and weak GDP may be discounted by the stock market ahead of an actual turnaround. Since WWII, U.S. GDP of plus or minus 1% around the longterm average of 3% has produced an average gain of 16% in the S&amp;P 500 and produced a positive return 83% of the time. The risk to our forecast is from growth disappointing our expectations, not from policymakers derailing the recovery. A key lesson from 2013 is that the stock market and economy can overcome many challenges by policymakers, including the fiscal cliff tax increases, the sequester spending cuts, the Fed tapering concerns, and the shutdown and debt ceiling brinkmanship. But a better pace of growth must materialize; just more bond buying by the Fed is not enough to lift valuations from current levels to propel further gains. LPL Financial Looking BackSome may fear an outsized gain in the stock market during 2013, is surely to be punished with losses in the coming year. However, historically after a one-year total return in the 25 – 30% range, the S&amp;P 500 has followed it up by more solid years of gains. In fact, the average return in a year following a 25 – 30% gain was 12%, and stocks posted a double-digit gain in four of the five occurrences (the exception was 1961’s gain of 26.9%, which was followed by a loss of 8.7% in 1962) [Figure 4]. In fact, most of the years were actually followed by several years of strong gains, as was the case in 1943, 2003, and 2009. Earnings GrowthWe expect more businesses will benefit from the improving trend in global economic data, which should help boost confidence in future earnings growth. Most notably, the widely followed ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index has a solid track record of forecasting earnings growth in coming quarters [Figure 5]. This indicator suggests a rebound from the sluggish performance of earnings and revenues in 2013. LPL Financial Given 3 – 4% global GDP and inflation of 1 – 2% in 2014 driving sales growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of about 5%, in conjunction with the benefit of ongoing buybacks and profit margin expansion, we expect earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5 – 10% in 2014. From our perspective, Wall Street analysts’ consensus estimate for earnings growth of 11% in 2014 may again be too high, since it would require a combination of even stronger economic growth and profit margin expansion beyond what are already record levels. Valuation ExpansionWith only about 5% earnings growth in 2013, but a 26% gain in the S&amp;P 500 Index (not including dividends) through mid-November 2013, it was clearly a year driven by rising valuation, as the rise in the PE did most of the lifting of the index. We expect the PE for the S&amp;P 500 to continue to rise in 2014, though not as much as in 2013. The rise in valuation in 2013 to about 16 was primarily a reversal of the PE contraction in 2011 and 2012, as the PE fell from around 15 at the end of 2010 to 13 in 2011 and ended 2012 at about 14. As the risk of a return to recession subsided and confidence in the durability of growth improved, the PE returned to average, as the economy kept growing despite all of the hits it took from fiscal cliff tax increases, sequester spending cuts, European bank bailouts, and Fed tapering concerns, among many others. As the economy accelerates in 2014 and earnings grow more rapidly, the PE is likely to rise further. Alternatively, if economic growth falters and earnings do not move higher, we would expect a modest drop in the PE and a decline for the stock market, despite more bond buying from the Fed. The market has become increasingly more sensitive to growth over policy. And it is the direction of growth, much more than magnitude, that matters. Remember that the Fed’s third round of bond buying, or QE3, announced in September 2012, failed to boost stocks until January 2013, when growth started to improve after the fourth quarter of 2012’s GDP growth rate of just 0.1%. While stock indexes like the S&amp;P 500 have hit all-time highs, the stocks are not currently valued at the levels that have marked the end of bull markets in the past. The PE for S&amp;P 500 companies using EPS over the past four quarters stands at about 16 as 2013 draws to a close. This is below the 17 – 18 PE where every secular and cyclical bull market has ended since WWII (with the exception of the late 1990s that ended much higher). We expect the PE for the S&amp;P 500 to end 2014 around 16.5 — a level last seen in 2005 and 2006. A rise of half a point seems reasonable based upon last year’s experience as risks receded and our expectation for growth to improve in the coming year. The rise in valuation contributes 0 – 5% to our 10 – 15% return forecast. The Bull ContinuesWhile stocks reacted negatively in 2013 when interest rates shot up sharply on fear of a premature end to the Fed’s bond-buying program, in general, stocks can go up even when bond yields rise — as we expect them to in 2014. Bull and bear market trends over the past 63 years reveal that the environment we foresee is most like that of the 1950s, when stocks were in a bull market while bonds and cash were in bear markets [Figure 6]. While the current market combination is rare, it is not unheard of — nor has it been a fleeting or fragile combination. For nearly the entire decade of the 1950s, stocks remained in an upward-trending, secular bull market while bonds and cash were mainly in a bear market. LPL Financial Bond yields may continue to rise in the coming years as the Fed ends the bond-buying program and GDP growth and inflation accelerate, maintaining the bear market for bonds. At the same time, the Fed may likely keep cash yields pinned down, with no interest rate hikes likely for at least a year or two, maintaining the bear market for cash. However, we are likely to avoid the ugly triple-bear markets of the late 1970s, where soaring inflation weighed heavily on stocks, bonds, and cash. Broadening GrowthNowhere were the effects of the Fed’s message on tapering felt more acutely in 2013 than in the world’s emerging markets (EM). The MSCI Emerging Market Index is down 4% for the year through mid-November 2013 compared with a more than 25% gain for U.S. stocks. Much of that weakness came following the Fed’s May 22, 2013 communication on its intention to taper its bond-buying program, with EM stocks falling about 15% during the following month. In addition, many EM currencies depreciated as investors pulled their money — echoing the start of the currency crises in Mexico in 1994 and Asian emerging markets in 1997, which were devastating to EM investors. Similar to the environment that preceded the July start of the 1997 – 98 Asian financial crisis, U.S. economic growth has prompted the Fed to consider reducing monetary stimulus. The Fed’s talk of tapering draws a comparison to the Fed rate hike of March 1997. Then, as now, the threat of reduced global liquidity created a headwind for emerging market countries and acted as a weight on the relative performance of EM stocks versus U.S. stocks. However, unlike 1997, these countries have not been creating debt-fueled bubbles in their economies. And their smaller deficits, larger foreign currency reserves, debt denominated in local currency, and flexible exchange rates are positives likely to help avoid another emerging market crisis. Chasing ReturnsWhile corporations are again likely to remain buyers of their stocks in the coming year, 2014 may finally be the year individual investors, as a group, begin to buy stocks in contrast to the net selling they have done since the bull market began nearly five years ago. The five-year trailing annualized return for stocks has been weak, especially compared to bonds, in recent years. However, as 2014 gets underway, the one-, three-, and five-year trailing annualized returns for the S&amp;P 500 will all be in the double digits for the first time this business cycle. Our analysis of history shows that it is the five-year return that individual investors tend to chase, based on net inflows to U.S. stock funds. As of March 6, 2014, five years from the bear market low in the S&amp;P 500 — even assuming no additional growth in the stock market between now and then — the five-year annualized return may have exceeded bonds’ 5% return by 20%. This may prompt many investors to reconsider the role of stocks in their portfolios, especially as interest rates rise and bond performance lags. With long-term interest rates remaining historically low, corporate earnings likely to grow in the high single digits, job growth improving, and inflation remaining below 3%, conditions are ripening for stocks to reward investors in 2014.
