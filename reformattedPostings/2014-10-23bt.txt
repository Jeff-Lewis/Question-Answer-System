One of the first Apple computers ever built has sold in New York for $905,000 (€715,000), making it the world’s most expensive computer relic, according to Bonhams auction house. The Apple-1 computer, built by hand in 1976 by Steve Wozniak in Steve Jobs’ garage (or possibly his sister’s bedroom), fetched nearly twice its pre-sale high estimate, Bonhams said. It was bought by the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. BonhamsThe museum’s representative “triumphantly raised the paddle” after beating competition from a telephone bidder, the auction house said in a statement. The computer came with an intact motherboard, vintage keyboard, Sanyo monitor, a custom power supply in wooden box and two vintage tape-decks. Cassandra Hatton, Bonhams senior specialist who ran the auction said, "The provenance on the Apple-1 is excellent and the condition is outstanding, so it was not surprising that it did so well." BonhamsThe Apple-1 is considered a vanguard of the personal computer revolution, being the first pre-assembled personal computer ever sold. Bonhams said the lot was one of just 50 hand-built for the ByteShop by Wozniak in the summer of 1976. Contains reporting from AFP. FREE AppDownload
