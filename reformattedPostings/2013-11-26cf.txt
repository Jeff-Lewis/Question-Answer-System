We're also getting some consumer and manufacturing data.

Housing starts have been delayed until December 18th.• At 9:00 AM, the FHFA House Price Index for September 2013. This was original a GSE only repeat sales, however there is also an expanded index. The consensus is for a 0.4% increase.• Also at 9:00 AM, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for September.
