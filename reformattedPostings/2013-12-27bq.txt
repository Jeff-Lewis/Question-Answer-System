REUTERS/Yuya ShinoThe latest batch of Japanese economic data showed signs of an ongoing recovery. Here's a quick look at the data we got out of Japan. While most Bank of Japan policymakers expect the recovery to continue in 2014, voiced concerns. "This may be indicative of a downward shift in growth, instead of merely a temporary slowdown," a Bank of Japan policymaker pointed out in the BoJ's November meeting, the minutes of which were released on Thursday. There is also concern that GDP growth will slow in Q2 2014 when the national sales tax is set to increase. Meanwhile, the Nikkei hit a six-year high but is down 0.5% since. FREE AppDownload
