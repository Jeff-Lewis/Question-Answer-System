REUTERS/Jason Lee The Shanghai Composite tumbled 1.8% Wednesday after the communique from the 3rd Plenum disappointed markets. Markets had been looking for reforms related to the financial sector, state-owned enterprises (SOE), land-reform, Hukou (residency permit system), and the one-child policy. Instead they received a broad blueprint.   The communique did change the language surrounding the role of markets. Beijing now thinks the market has gone from playing a Jichuxing (basic) role in the economy, to Juedingxing, (decisive) role in the economy. "We suspect the Chinese people won’t interpret too much from this change," writes Bank of America's Ting Lu.  So what can we take away from the communique? Not everyone, however, was disappointed. Yao said the Plenum met her expectations. Based on the communique she maintains her expectations that the most likely and imminent measures will be interest rate liberalization, more experiments in the Shanghai free-trade zone, and a relaxation of the one-child policy.
