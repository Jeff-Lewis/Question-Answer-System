Tesla MotorsNikkei.com is reporting that Tesla has signed a deal with Panasonic to have the industrial giant supply the electric automaker with the machinery to stock its first Gigafactory. The deal is worth between $194 million and $291 million. Overall investment in the project could climb to $5 billion with Panasonic's share climbing to $1 billion, Nikkei says.
