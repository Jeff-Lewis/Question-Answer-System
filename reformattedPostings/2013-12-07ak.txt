USFWS PacificThe "loonie" is key to one of Goldman's top trades.Goldman Sachs has unveiled its top six trade recommendations for the year ahead in a series of notes to clients. The trades aren't for everyone and some of them are pretty technical. Many of the recommendations are pair trades (buy one thing, sell another) driven by what is perhaps the most important and widely-expected macro development in the year ahead: a winding down of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program. "The purpose of the Top Trade Recommendation list is, as always, to connect specific and actionable trade ideas to the set of key market themes that are likely to play out over the course of the year and that we expect to form the backbone of our strategic approach to markets for the year to come," says Goldman Sachs managing director Noah Weisberger. "While our initial list will be comprehensive, and connect back to the economic and market forces as we see them currently, we are likely to add to the list of Top Trade Recommendations (along with our usual slate of tactical trade recommendations) as the year progresses, as our views evolve, and as market risks and opportunities shift."  FREE AppDownload
