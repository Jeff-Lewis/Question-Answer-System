RBS is the latest bank to have all its dirty laundry aired in the Libor scandal that rocked banks around the world this summer. This morning, the CFTC and England's financial regulator, the FSA, both released a treasure trove of instant messages between employees involved with rate rigging. That's embarrassing, of course, but it's also costly. According to the Wall Street Journal, the RBS will pay a $610 million fine for manipulating the interest rate. A quick look into what was going on at the bank through the conversations RBS employees were having tells you how widespread rate fixing was. The conversations are unabashed, sometimes filthy, and a little appalling — no one knows how to get caught with their pants down like Wall Street. We already caught one instant classic in the mix. One RBS trader compared himself to a "whore's drawers."         These are probably going to sting for a while. FREE AppDownload
