The Australian dollar is getting slammed. Here's a chart, via FinViz, of the last several hours. FinViz So what's going on? A combination of weak data, and dovish talk. In an email, SocGen's Kit Juckes explained: If this is a market-moving week, it will be because of what emerges from the FOMC meeting (tomorrow) and the US ISM and payroll data (Friday). Today is therefore a bit of a sideshow, dominated overnight by another AUD fall. Very soft building approvals (-6.9% in June with May revised lower), were followed up by RBA Governor Stevens saying that inflation data still give the RBA scope to ease further.
