 Wage inflation remains abnormally low although the labor market has clearly tightened. The short-term unemployment rate fell to 3.9% during October, the lowest reading since November 2007. Back then, wage inflation was 3.3%. Today, it is only 2.0%. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that she believes that wage inflation is too low. She would prefer to see it rise to 3%-4% before starting to normalize the federal funds rate. I monitor wages in various key industries and am hard-pressed to see any signs of mounting inflationary pressures. During October, here were the y/y increases for the ones we monitor from highest to lowest: leisure &amp; hospitality (3.6%), information services (3.3), mining &amp; logging (2.9), construction (2.6), professional &amp; business services (2.4), retail trade (2.3), financial activities (2.0), manufacturing (1.9), utilities (1.7), transportation &amp; warehousing (1.2), education &amp; health services (1.1), and wholesale trade (1.1). Today's Morning Briefing: The New Abnormal. (1) Tower of London.
