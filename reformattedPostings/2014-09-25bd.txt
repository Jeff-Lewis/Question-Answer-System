Yahoo Finance Apple is down more than 3% this morning, taking shares to $98.11 as of this writing.  We're really not sure why the stock is dropping. There's no immediately obvious reason.  Apple has had some hiccups in the past couple of days — the iOS 8 update messed up people's phones, and the iPhone 6 Plus has been bending for some users.  Both of those seem like minor blips for Apple. The iOS 8 update is embarrassing, but Apple quickly addressed it. The bending issue feels like a nontroversy. A few people are claiming it happens.  The market overall is down, so it makes sense that Apple is also falling.  FREE AppDownload
