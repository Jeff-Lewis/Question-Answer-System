Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesOn September 16th and 17th hundreds of investors will get together in New York City for the Value Investing Congress (VIC). And since last year, the Congress has added a bonus to your run-of-the-mill investment presentations and cheese platters by introducing a little competition — an investment idea contest called the Value Investing Challenge. A panel of judges made up of top financial professionals will take  a look at these three ideas, plucked tirelessly from hundreds of submissions to the competition's co-sponsor, SumZero — a networking site for buy side professionals. The ideas are then ranked, and a winner is chosen from the three finalists. The first prize winner gets to present their winning idea to the VIC, $50,000 cash, 1 free year's subscription to FactSet (another sponsor of the Challenge), and free attendance at the VIC's investing workshop. Until then, you can judge the ideas yourselves. This year's final three ideas are in — two shorts and a long position. Each thesis is published in full at valueinvestingchallenge.com, but we've got the bullets for you below. First up, David Swartz, a financial analyst at Pacific West Land, LLC.
