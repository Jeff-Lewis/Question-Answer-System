REUTERS/Jim Young The entire global financial markets are selling off sharply today. U.S. stock markets are getting slammed early in the trading session. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are down by over 1.5%.  This follows major sell-offs in Europe and Asia earlier today, and it extends yesterday's U.S. market sell-off. Globally, investors are digesting two big headlines: The first headline seems to be fueling strength in the dollar, while the second could be exacerbating the rout in commodities. Treasury rates are rallying, which means U.S. bonds are getting slammed too. The 10-year yield is at 2.40%, up 5 basis points from yesterday's close.  It was as high as 2.47% earlier today. In fact government bonds are selling off around the world: Emerging markets have suffered considerably as investors fear that rising rates mean funding strains for these economies.  The Brazilian stock market is down 3.4%.
