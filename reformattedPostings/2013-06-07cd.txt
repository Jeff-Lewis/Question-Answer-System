Flickr/gregw66Good morning! It's Jobs Day! At 8:30 AM ET, the BLS will release the Non-Farm Payrolls report (AKA: The Jobs Report) for May. Analysts expect somewhere on the order of 165K new jobs created, a number that's come down in recent days as data has been weak and pessimism has grown. In the meantime, markets aren't doing much. Japan had a virtually unchanged day. US futures are down a hair. Europe is up a hair. For now, things are calm. FREE AppDownload
