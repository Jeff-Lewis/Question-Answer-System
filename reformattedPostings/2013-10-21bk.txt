REUTERS/ Larry DowningJP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon"We're trying to get it resolved." That's what JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Monday, in reaction to news that the bank has reached a tentative $13 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, the New York attorney general, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over allegations of sales of shoddy mortgage securities. "I am so damn proud of this company. That's what I think about when I wake up everyday," he added in an interview that aired on "Squawk Box," saying that "260,000 people around the world are going a great job for our clients. We're gaining market share. We're doing great stuff. We're trying to get our problems behind us." As for the potential of criminal charges down the road against JPMorgan, Dimon reiterated, "We are going to resolve every matter as best as we can, and then we're going to move on and serve our clients." Many of the government investigations involve practices at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual—companies that JPMorgan purchased during the 2008 financial crisis at the behest of the government and the Federal Reserve.
