dbking, FlickrMarkets are generally lower. Starting off with Asia, Japan fell 1.45% last night. The Nikkei has been wobbly lately, and Japan is riding a string of weak economic data. Europe is generally lower. Italy is down 0.6% (despite a better than expected unemployment report) and Germany is off 0.37% despite a weak retail sales number. France is off by about the same amount. US futures are just down a hair. There are four big events in the US today. They are: The ADP Jobs report (which is a preview for Friday's official jobs report), the GDP report, Chicago PMI (a regional manufacturing index) and a Fed decision this afternoon.
