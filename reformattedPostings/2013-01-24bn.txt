The stock, which has been a hedge fund favorite for quite some time, was last down more than 11.6% today.  Here's a rundown of the ten hedge funds with the largest stake in Apple, according to 13F data for the third quarter ended 9/30/2012 compiled by Bloomberg.  In his Q4 letter to investors yesterday, Einhorn wrote how their "bruised" Apple stake hurt their fourth quarter performance.  The fund was down 4.9% in Q4. Einhorn also said that with Apple shares sliding in fourth quarter they erased their gains from the third quarter.  However, he said he used that opportunity to repurchase shares they sold in the third quarter.   Also, as a reminder, hedge funds only have to disclose their long holdings in 13F filings with the SEC.  Fourth quarter 13Fs will be out in mid-February.
