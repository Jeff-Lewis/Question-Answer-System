Getty Images/ Neilson Barnard For this year's list of the "sexiest" Wall Streeters, we decided to go in a bit of a different direction. Instead of the typical Jamie Dimon, Dan Loeb, and Bill Ackman lineup, we scoured Wall Street for new names. Of course, we still have a few household names on the list, too.   For the list, our guest judge Stephanie Ruhle, the anchor of Bloomberg TV's "Market Makers," helped come up with some names of the sexiest men in finance.  If you'd like to nominate someone for a future list, please send a photo and a brief bio to jlaroche@businessinsider.com.  FREE AppDownload
