ShutterstockWhat do hedge funds do, and how do they make money? These are questions everyone wants answers to. And most people would like those answers to not be too technical. Reddit user gadela08 who claims to be a hedge fund insider provides a brief, crystal clear explanation of how hedge funds operate. 1) On securities research and analysis Here are the Redditor's key points: That last bullet includes testing legal limitations. Here's exactly what the Redditor said (emphasis added): We maintain open contact with over 40 different brokers in various markets. Every day, these guys send me hundreds of emails and text messages over bloomberg telling me as much as they legally can about what kind of flows they're seeing. When they buy a large block of securities from a client, they let me know what they just bought and offer me a structured trade for those products so they clear the risk off their books. sometimes they call me to tell me interesting or urgent news about a particular trade that i currently have on that I may have missed in the news that morning. This gives you a sense of how the big players can have an edge over mom-and-pop. 2) On the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) The EMH more or less argues that the all available information is already priced into the market. And therefore, it is basically impossible to beat the market. However, many dispute this theory and believe it's a mistake to take it too seriously. Another Redditor identified six ways a trader could theoretically take advantage of inefficiencies. We paraphrase here. Again, all this just goes to show that mom-and-pop are likely to have a disadvantage relative to the big players. Read the whole thread at Reddit. FREE AppDownload
