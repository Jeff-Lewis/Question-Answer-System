Via @stocktwits, here's the new cover of TIME Stocktwits Confetti! Wall Street! So is this one of those bearish cover-jinx indicators? No. The not-so-subtle message is that the recovery has been a sham perpetrated by banksters and that we're on the verge of collapse "all over again." This has been the standard line since day 1 one of the recovery, that it's all a fraud and that it will all go busto any day now. Get really worried if you see the skepticism and anger disappear.
