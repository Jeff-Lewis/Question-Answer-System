Wikimedia Commons/ Fir0002/FlagstaffotosThe March edition of Bloomberg Markets Magazine features its ranking of the best emerging markets for investors.  A key takeaway: Bloomberg indicates that the BRIC nations aren't as attractive as they used to be. For the past three years, stock exchanges in Brazil, Russia, India, and China underperformed global markets. According to Michael Patterson, "investors withdrew a net $1.65 billion from mutual funds that invest in the four countries tracked by research firm EPFR Global." Investors are most concerned about the degree of government interference in the BRIC economies. Bloomberg used a variety of criteria to rank these countries, from GDP growth projections to literacy rates. Courtesy of Bloomberg, we present this list of the most attractive emerging markets for investors, which includes GDP growth, average annual inflation, and government debt-to-GDP ratios from 2013 to 2017, as well as the country's rank on the ease of doing business.
