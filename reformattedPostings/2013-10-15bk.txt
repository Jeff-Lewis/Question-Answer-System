This post is sponsored by Principal Financial Group. In New York, it's hard to hear the word "free" without waiting to see what the catch is. But The Principal Financial Group did, believe it or not, offer free cab rides and free financial advice — with its "Take Action On Your Financial Dreams" program. In this video, a general contractor is asked, "What keeps you up at night?" while two other riders are told how to set up their nonprofit to serve the community and its employees. Watch and see advisors from The Principal giving real-world advice in the most real-world place imaginable: the back of a New York City cab.   Learn more at Principal.com.
