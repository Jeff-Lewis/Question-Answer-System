Last year, with heavy hearts, we reported the news that Gallagher's Steakhouse would be closing. Now according to the NY Post, the restaurant has been saved. Sure, there are other steakhouses, but Gallagher's has been in its West 55th Street location since the 1920s. Plus, last year saw the closure of another great steakhouse, Ben Benson's so frankly, we were already bruised. Thankfully, Gallagher's won't be going that way. Owner Marlene Brody sold the restaurant to Dan Poll, the operator of Boathouse. Gallagher's was set to close on January 16th. From the NY Post: “It’s part of the fabric of New York, and I’m privileged to own it,” Poll said. He said the restaurant will continue to be called Gallagher’s and retain its classic, early- and mid-20th century look, including a meat locker at the entrance and wood-paneled dining rooms festooned with vintage photos of entertainers, politicians, athletes — and racehorses... Customers often bumped into regulars like Shirley MacLaine, Jackie Mason, Broadway hoofers and even boxers heading for press conferences in the private upstairs room. Gallagher’s benefited from the theater district’s cleaned-up street environment and tourism boom — but lost its appeal among a younger crowd enamored of modern steakhouses offering leaner, grass-fed and “artisanal” cuts. Leaner shmeaner... those cuts look pretty good to us. FREE AppDownload
