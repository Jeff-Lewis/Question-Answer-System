According to the latest data from Fiserv Case-Shiller, National home prices are expected to rise 3.3 percent in the next five years. Of course, there will be many cities that see home prices lag behind the rest of the country. We drew on the Fiserv Case-Shiller data to identify the 15 worst housing markets in the U.S. The bottom 15 cities are ranked by the projected annualized change in home prices between Q3 2012 and Q3 2017. We also included the median home price, median household income, unemployment rate, and the change in home prices since their peak, to offer a broader view of the local economy and housing market. Note: The median family income and home price is for Q3 2012. Unemployment data is as of December 2012, and population data for the metros is for 2011. FREE AppDownload
