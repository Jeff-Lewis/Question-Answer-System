YouTube via RTVEcuadorYesterday, we filled you in on the massive scandal in Ecuador, in which former Central Bank President Pedro Delgado admitted to falsifying his qualifications to get into graduate school. Delgado fled to the United States, and has since had his visa revoked. As incredible as it seems, the story has taken an even more bizarre and embarrassing twist. Though there have been no Delgado sightings in Miami, his last known location, Radio Sucre reports that he released a statement today through his lawyer, Juan Carlos Carmigniani. In the statement, Delgado insists that he will not be returning to Ecuador. He claims to be a persecuted 'political refugee' and is seeking a safe haven. He did not indicate any basis for his standing as a 'political refugee' – as opposed to any other alleged criminal on the run from the law. If Delgado returns to Ecuador, he faces charges that could carry a prison sentence between nine and 12 years. FREE AppDownload
