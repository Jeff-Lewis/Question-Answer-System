Given the Federal Reserve's focus on U.S. economic data and its implications for policy, it's helpful to understand which parts of the economy are getting stronger and which ones aren't. Following last week's release of the first look at Q3 U.S. GDP, Barclays economists put together 22 charts breaking down by sector how the recovery has progressed over the past six years relative to other recoveries. "Despite the pickup in Q3, the recovery in GDP in the current cycle remains sub-par," write the economists in a note clients. "The weakness of consumer spending is the main reason. Consumption growth slowed in Q3 and is likely still suffering from a delayed response to tax hikes at the start of the year. The recovery in income growth and savings since then is an encouraging sign that consumer spending growth will pick up in Q4 and 2014." Thanks to Barclays for permission to run these charts.
