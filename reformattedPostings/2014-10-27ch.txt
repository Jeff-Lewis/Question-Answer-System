AP Images(Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc &lt;vrx.to&gt; &lt;vrx.n&gt; said it is prepared to improve its offer for Allergan Inc &lt;agn.n&gt; to at least $200 per share. The Botox maker's shares closed at $184.21 on Friday. Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in a letter to Allergan's board that Allergan's stock would not be trading at the multiples it is now if it were not for Valeant's offer. Pearson told Reuters last week that a possible revised stock-and-cash bid would be worth more than $200 per share, assuming that Valeant's stock rises, and would include more cash.   (Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) FREE AppDownload
