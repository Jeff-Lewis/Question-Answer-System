Last month, 65 cases of Panny Van Winkle — currently the most coveted bourbon in the world — up and disappeared from a warehouse in Kentucky.  You might think the booze thiefs were in it for the money, as a 20-year Pappy comes with a suggested retail price of $130. But perhaps they were just anticipating crazy liquor store lines. As Grubstreet reports, Tuesday was "Pappy Day" in Kentucky, with customers waiting for hours to get their hands on a 15-, 20-, or 23-year-old bottle.
