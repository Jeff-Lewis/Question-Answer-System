REUTERS/Issei KatoBloomberg Markets Magazine is out with their annual ranking of America's Best Stock Analysts. These stock pickers rode the wave of 2012, a year where more than 300 S&amp;P stocks saw returns over 10%. And as individual stocks and sectors stop correlating with the market as a whole, it's even more important to know which equities to buy and sell. To compile the ranking, Stamford-based Greenwich Associates surveyed almost 950 buyside analysts at 190 different investment firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, and more asking them who they considered to be the best of the best for investment advice. The list breaks down the best analysts by sector, but the overall winner was J.P. Morgan. Under the tutelage of equity research head Noelle Grainger, the team scored the largest number in the survey for the fourth consecutive year. Thanks to Bloomberg Markets for letting us run the list.
