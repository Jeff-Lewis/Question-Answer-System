WikipediaThe penthouse apartment that belonged to late investor Martin Zweig could soon hit the market for between $100 million and $120 million, sources told The New York Post. The penthouse, inside The Pierre on Fifth Avenue and Central Park, is a 12,000-square-foot triplex with a ballroom, four terraces, and views of Central Park, according to Curbed NY. Zweig, a stock investor, investment advisor, and financial analyst, died in February. He paid $21.5 million for the penthouse back in 1999, setting a real estate record at the time. He tried — but failed — to sell it for $70 million several years ago, according to Curbed. The apartment has not yet been officially listed. But if it is listed for more than $100 million, it will become the most expensive apartment for sale in New York City. Ex-Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill's penthouse at 15 Central Park West sold last year for a record $88 million. FREE AppDownload
