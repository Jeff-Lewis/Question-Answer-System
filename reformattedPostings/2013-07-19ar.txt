The takeaway is that for most EM currencies, we appear to be in the midst of a shallow corrective bounce from the May-June sell-off. We think the bounce can be extended, but we believe EM will find it hard to gain medium-term traction until the Fed tapering story is much clearer. For now, it remains muddy and so we expect further volatility ahead for EM FX. Whatever the case, it’s best to be selective and stick with the names with stronger fundamentals, especially external accounts. On the equity side, EM has behaved differently than DM this year. Most EM equity markets peaked in January and fell steadily through much of H1 before bouncing a bit as H2 gets under way. In this piece, we will focus on the EM equity moves that took place in May, June, and July in an effort to capture the tapering-related moves that we are comparing in EM FX. Most of EM equity markets continue to lag the S&amp;P, which has fully retraced the down move from the May 22 peak and is making new highs.
