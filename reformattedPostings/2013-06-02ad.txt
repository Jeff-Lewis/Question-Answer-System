MarkitChina's unofficial HSBC manufacturing PMI report is out and its disappointing. The headline number fell to 49.2 from 50.4 a month ago.  This was worse than economists' expectation fo 49.6. A reading below 50 signals contraction. Here are the key points from Markit: From HSBC's Hongbin Qu: “The downward revision of the final HSBC China Manufacturing PMI suggests a marginal weakening of manufacturing activities towards the end of May, thanks to deteriorating domestic demand conditions. With persisting external headwinds, Beijing needs to boost domestic demand to avoid a further deceleration of manufacturing output growth and its negative impact on the labour market. The new leaders should strike a delicate balance between reform and growth.” On Friday, we learned that China's official PMI report unexpectedly climbed to 50.8 from 50.6 in April.  Economists were looking for a decline to 50.0. All of this comes on renewed fears that China is slowing down again. China's HSBC PMI report has a greater weight toward small and medium sized enterprises, which tend to be more sensitive to economic swings. FREE AppDownload
