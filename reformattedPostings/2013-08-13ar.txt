  Everyone at some point has to wear a tie. And there are so many different ties and tie knots to choose from. Among the classics is the Windsor Half Knot - the classic triangular tie knot you see so often. It is the kind of tie knot that will serve you well in most situations. David Goldberg, Founder and CEO of Freshneck.com (a Netflix-like subscription service for ties, bow ties, and other accessories) took us to the showroom of Alenford, an online retailer of fine Italian-made shirts, to learn how to properly tie a Half-Windsor knot.
