Getty / Justin SullivanLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner LinkedIn just announced its Q2 earnings. It's a beat on both the top and bottom lines.  Here are the numbers: Stock was up as much as 13% in reaction, but has since cooled to about 8% after-hours. Revenue increased 47% year-over-year, with LinkedIn's talent solutions products, which help recruiters find the right candidates, accounting for 60% of the total $533.9 million revenue. Marketing and premium subscriptions each made up 20% of the revenue. About two-thirds of LinkedIn's more than 300 million users are international, but revenue from the U.S. still makes up about 60% of the total.  One of the things analysts had their eyes on was LinkedIn's revenue growth. They were concerned that the growth rate was going to continue to decelerate, but it actually accelerated, increasing 47% year-over-year this quarter compared to 46% year-over-year last quarter. For the full year, LinkedIn is expecting revenue of between $2.14 and $2.15 billion. The company also just announced the launch of a new enterprise product called "Sales Navigator," which will connect salespeople and buyers, and highlighted the growth of its long-form publisher platform, which sees about 30,000 new posts weekly. When LinkedIn launched the program, it was only available to a select group of "Influencers," but now 15 million people have posting capabilities.  Here's the official statement from CEO Jeff Weiner: Here's a look at LinkedIn's historic revenue: LinkedIn FREE AppDownload
