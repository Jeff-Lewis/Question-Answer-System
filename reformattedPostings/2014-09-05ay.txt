CNBC/Scott WapnerScott Wapner, the anchor of "Halftime Report," is a big star over at CNBC. He works hard, he books big-name guests, and he's constantly getting big scoops and breaking news.  We also can never forget the time he beautifully refereed the historic on-air brawl between billionaire hedge fund titans Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman. He was also the one who helped bring the pair of longtime rivals together to hug it out on stage at the CNBC Delivering Alpha Conference.  Wapner gave us a glimpse into what his typical day is like.  FREE AppDownload
