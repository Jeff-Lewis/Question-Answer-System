Spending climbed 0.3%, which was right in line with expectations. The personal saving rate — personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income —climbed to 3.2% from 3.0% in April. Overall, this is a positive report as the numbers show Americans are saving more even as they are increasingly spending. FREE AppDownload
