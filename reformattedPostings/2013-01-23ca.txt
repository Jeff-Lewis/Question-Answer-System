In 1987 PBS released a documentary called 'Trader' featuring legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and his firm Tudor Investments. But the film was never given a chance to catch on. PTJ hated it, and bought up almost all the copies of the film as soon as he could. Every now and again a copy surfaces online (like yesterday — it's already down) but the question generally remains — why did PTJ hate the movie so much? At the time it was made, the market was shooting up but PTJ and his team were (correctly) calling a crash to come. In the film, they also show a lot of care for managing risk and taking care of their clients. There's even a look into the awesome charity work that PTJ does with kids in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. Some speculate that PTJ felt that his trading secrets were revealed in the documentary. Others suggest that he was embarrassed of how he looked while he was trading. Regardless, there's never been an official answer to this question so there's always room for more theories as to why PTJ killed this documentary, here are some of ours. FREE AppDownload
