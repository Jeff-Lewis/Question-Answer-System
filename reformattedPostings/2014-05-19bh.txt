AP ImagesThe real-life Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, now a motivational speaker, said at a conference in Dubai that he expects to make more than $100 million from his speaking tour this year, Bloomberg reports. Belfort is the author of a best-selling tell-all memoir that chronicled his boozy, drug-fueled Wall Street lifestyle running the Stratton Oakmont boiler room, a firm that used high-pressure sales tactics in the 1990s. His book was adapted into a film, "The Wolf of Wall Street," which was directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Leonardo DiCaprio. Belfort was arrested and convicted for securities fraud and money laundering. He served a 22-month prison sentence after being sentenced to four years. He was also ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to victims of Stratton Oakmont. He hasn’t finished paying them back yet, but he said at the Dubai conference that he would be able to finish doing so thanks to his speaking tour.  "My goal is to make north of a $100 million so I am paying back everyone this year," he told the audience, according to Bloomberg. As a stockbroker, he made about $50 million per year. FREE AppDownload
