Zillow has been an enthusiastic user of social media to communicate with investors, as CEO Spencer Rascoff has nearly 9,000 tweets, and the company has previouslyreleased earnings information on Stocktwits. This marks the next logical step, one that other companies are sure to follow. Whether it's tweets from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings or Tesla CEO Elon Musk, or the Twitter "hack crash" yesterday, social media's influence on markets and finance continues to grow, controversially at times. Nonetheless, it's likely that there's no turning back, so it'll be up to companies, investors, and regulators to put in place rules to govern best practices on these growing platforms.
