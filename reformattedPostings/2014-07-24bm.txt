Flickr via Kansas City DistrictCaterpillar just announced Q2 earnings that beat expectations, and announced a big stock buyback. This could be good news for the whole economy. As a global supplier of construction and mining equipment, Caterpillar is a bellwether of economic activity. Every quarter, management provides an overview of the economy based on what they see. Here are some of the key 2014 forecasts: Here's the whole outlook: 2014 Outlook Economic OutlookWe anticipate global economic growth in 2014 of about 2.5 percent, a modest improvement from 2013 levels. Most developed countries continue to pursue pro-growth policies, which should continue to benefit those economies. However, many developing countries have raised interest rates and in many of those countries rates are near the peak reached in 2011. At that time, higher rates slowed those economies, and similar problems are occurring now. Our economic outlook assumes that developed economies will continue to improve while developing economies will remain challenged. We expect global economic growth in 2014 to be sufficient to increase demand for mined commodities and energy, keeping commodity prices at levels that support production. Mining company profits improved in 2013, and increased production and cost cutting should support further improvement. While most commodity prices should remain high enough to make investments attractive, we expect companies will continue to be cautious about resuming equipment investments, and we expect mining capital expenditures in 2014 to be below 2013.
