The lender in Trump Soho, the hotel Trump unveiled on his show The Apprentice, has decided to foreclose on the property, according to the Wall Street Journal.  From the WSJ: Real-estate investor CIM Group, which holds a junior loan on the property, is taking control of the building through a foreclosure process and his hired brokerage Eastdil Secured to auction off the property.
