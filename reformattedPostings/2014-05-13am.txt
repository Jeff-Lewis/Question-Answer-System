Noto has been with Goldman for more than a decade, with a two-year carveout serving as CFO of the NFL. He was once ranked Wall Street's No. 1 internet analyst.  The hedge fund, Coatue, which also has investments in FlipBoard and Hoteltonight, recently launched a $300 million fund in early 2013 for high-growth, pre-IPO startups.  BI's Alyson Shontell profiled Coatue this winter after the Silicon Valley fund invested $50 million in Snapchat.  Noto will be based out of New York. He is actually on Twitter at @anthonynoto. (Warning and/or great news: It's 90% sports and 10% tech and business.)
