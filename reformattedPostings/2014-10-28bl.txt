Consumer confidence is at a 7-year high! The Conference Board's index of confidence unexpectedly jumped to 94.5 in October from 89.0 in September. This is the highest level since October 2007.

"Looking ahead, consumers have regained confidence in the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market, and are more optimistic about their future earnings potential. With the holiday season around the corner, this boost in confidence should be a welcome sign for retailers."

"Holiday shopping will be strong." FREE AppDownload
