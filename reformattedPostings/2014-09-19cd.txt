AP Images On Thursday, Scottish voters headed to the polls. When the votes were counted, the tally came in 55% "No" and 45% "Yes." "But that is not the end of the story," wrote Societe Generale analysts. "The Scots pulled back from the brink but much now remains to be done." Indeed, those 45% still have demands, and they're unlikely to go quietly. "The status quo in Scotland is not going to remain, as there will be devolution of further powers to the Scottish parliament," UBS's Paul Donovan said. It could be months before we have some clarity. "Not only do the details of devolution for Scotland have to be worked out but also the UK government has to address the demands for English devolution and to correct the imbalances of voting rights within the UK parliament," SocGen added. "This will remain a challenging time for the government in the run-up to next May’s general election." The next huge twist could come early next year. Lorcan Roche Kelly of Agenda Research explains: We feel the clamour of “us too!” calls for devolution for England, Wales and Northern Ireland will delay this process beyond the life of the current parliament.... Which means that next May’s UK general election will be fought on allowing devolved powers to all UK member states on the one hand, and a promise of an in-out referendum on EU membership on the other. So that will be exciting. In the meantime, markets are really liking the results. Stocks are up everywhere, and the pound has rallied hard (though it's cooled off a bit today) Meanwhile, Catalonia will hold its own independence referendum on Nov. 9.    FREE AppDownload
