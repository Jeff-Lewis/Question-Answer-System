Graham Flanagan/Business InsiderThe "D" has arrived. The Tesla "D" that Elon Musk so provocatively tweeted about last week is actually an all-wheel-drive version of the Model S Sedan. There will be three versions, and each will carry the "D" designation, to distinguish them from the rear-wheel-drive Model S. AWD will be a plus for Tesla's customers in the Northeast and in Northern Europe, to deal with bad weather. The current performance version of the Model S — the P85 — will become the P85D and be capable of 0-60 mph in a blistering 3.2 seconds. That acceleration is right up there with supercars from Ferrari, Porsche, and Mercedes.

Commenting on the "D," Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said the features would "allow Tesla to keep pace with competing luxury makes while still banking on its primary advantage — a pure electric drivetrain. Until the Model X arrives, these upgrades should keep the Model S at the forefront of advanced personal transportation.”  Some photos from the event: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesThe D has dual motors — one for each set of wheels.
