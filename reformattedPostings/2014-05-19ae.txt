via YouTubeThis shot was taken with a GoPro camera.GoPro, the portable camera company, filed for its IPO Monday. The company is profitable. It made $61 million in 2013. Revenue seems to be growing nicely year over year too. The company generated $986 million in 2013, up from $526 million in 2012 and $234 million in 2011. Now for some weird stuff. Quarter by quarter, revenue appears to be all over the place. In fact, revenue in Q1 2014 ($236 million) was down versus Q1 2013 ($255 million).  Basically, things are growing nicely, but revenue can be a bit unpredictable. In the filing, GoPro blamed production problems for the revenue decline in Q1 2014 versus Q1 2013. GoPro says a new product that was supposed to launch in Q4 2012 was delayed. That explains the higher-than-normal sales in Q1 2013. But the product launch cycle evened out after that, which explains the year-over-year revenue decline. Here's a detailed look at GoPro's income.
