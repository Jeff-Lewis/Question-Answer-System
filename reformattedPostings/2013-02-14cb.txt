Chris Sloan/Airchive(Reuters) - American Airlines and US Airways Groupsaid they plan to merge in a deal that will form the world's biggest air carrier, which will have a combined equity value of $11 billion. The merger caps a wave of consolidation that has helped put U.S. airlines on more solid financial footing. The widely expected deal has been more than a year in the making. American, a unit of AMR Corp, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2011, and US Airways began its pursuit of a merger in early 2012.
