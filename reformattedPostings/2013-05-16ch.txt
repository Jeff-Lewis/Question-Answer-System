Many skeptics of the Fed’s bond buying policy point to the bond market shellacking of 1994. That year, 10-year rates rose to 7.8% from 5.5% when the Fed started cranking up rates. They worry about a repeat as Team Bernanke winds down the current QE program. But JPMorgan isn’t so concerned: The prospect that the Fed may taper the pace of its asset purchases later this year has raised some concern that long-term interest rates could experience a 1994- like outcome, a year in which 10-year Treasury rates climbed 200bp. This concern has become so great that Chairman Bernanke even addressed it in a speech in early March. However, we believe there is limited risk that a tapering of asset purchases would produce an unwanted or accidental tightening in financial conditions at odds with the Fed’s macroeconomic objectives. … The expected QE coefficient shows that every $10bn in Fed purchases depresses 10-year yields by approximately 3.3bp; ...therefore, tapering Fed asset purchases from $85bn down to $0bn should cause 10-year yields to increase by 25-30bp.
