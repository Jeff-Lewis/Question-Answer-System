ReutersRising inflation, higher property prices, and policymakers' focus on growth has raised a few questions about Chinese monetary tightening.  But there has been much confusion about what metrics to track. Should we be watching broad money supply, measures of credit like loan growth, total social financing (TSF) and so on, or interest rates.  In a new note, Bank of America's Ting Lu writes that the three best indicators of China's "monetary stance" are seven-day repo rates, revised TSF growth, and loan growth  Based on these indicators, Lu writes that monetary policy will be 'neutral' in the first half of the year and will be modestly tightened in the second half. The seven-day repo rate is expected to stay between 3 - 3.5 percent in the first half of the year. Bank loan growth is expected to be around 15 percent and is expected to ease to 14.3 percent by the end of the year. Revised TSF growth is forecast to be between 18 - 20 percent in the first half of the year, before easing to about 16 percent in the second half. FREE AppDownload
