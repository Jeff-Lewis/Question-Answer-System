The February issue of Bloomberg Markets Magazine contains its annual ranking of the 100 best performing large ($1 billion-plus AUM) hedge funds of the previous year. We have the top 30 for you here. In 2013, only 16 hedge funds were able to outperform the S&amp;P 500, and for the most part those 16 did the same thing — go long stocks all the way.    The number one spot belongs to Larry Robbins, the CEO of Glenview Capital. His fund finished the year on top with an astonishing 84 percent return. While some managers were nervous and held on to cash, Glenview bet that Obamacare would pump up healthcare stocks and ran with that. For what it's worth, Robbins sees more "underhanded softballs" being thrown all over the stock market in 2014 too.
