The fitness tracking company Fitbit just launched its first video ad. The campaign coincides with the rollout of new products that includes a "fitness super watch" called the Surge. The advertisement was created by Argonaut, a boutique creative agency in San Francisco, and its music features Brett Anderson, the lead singer of The Donnas. The ads were directed by Daniel and Katina Mercadante, an acclaimed filmmaking team that has produced campaigns for brands like Apple, Facebook, and Volkswagen.  Video courtesy of Fitbit
