Coach shares tumbled by more than 6% after the company reported Wednesday that North American same-store sales plunged 13.6% in the most recent quarter.  Coach executives conceded in an earnings call that rivals such as Michael Kors and Tory Burch have taken market share. The company also said it's seeing "substantially lower traffic" in stores as the company tries to transform into a lifestyle brand by offering more than just handbags, such as footwear and accessories.  We saw evidence of this at Bloomingdale's during the holiday shopping season. We visited Coach's shoe display and found it empty, while the neighboring Tory Burch display was packed with customers.
