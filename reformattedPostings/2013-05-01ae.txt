There's no word more common in the investment game than this: Diversify. But diversity goes beyond just a mish-mash of different of asset classes. Geography is another way to cover all your bases –– and it's a lot easier than you might think.  U.S. News &amp; World Report's Miranda Marquit outlines three simple ways to get into the foreign investing game:  1. Try seeking out foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges. Why: It's easier to go through U.S. channels if you've got your eye on a hot foreign company. 2. Take advantage of low-cost index funds. Why: They're cheaper, for starters, and index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) give you access to a host of asset classes you might not otherwise be exposed to. Just pay close attention to your risk tolerance –– not all funds are created equally. 3. Consider REITs. Why: If you're too squeamish to commit to plucking up property in foreign real estate markets, REITs might be the answer. They are real estate investment trusts that focus on foreign properties.
