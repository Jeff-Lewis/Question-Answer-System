Lumber futures turned out to be a good predictor of US housing starts. The large decline earlier this year (see post) translated into weaker than expected residential construction in June (see post).

SoberLook After a disappointing result in June, is construction picking up this month ? Many economists think so. The key data that researchers point to is the Homebuilders' survey, which is at the highest levels since 2006. SoberLook The index had certainly diverged from housing starts in the past, but the combination of this survey and higher lumber prices may be pointing to an improvement in residential construction for July. The US economy could certainly use it. FREE AppDownload
