via ZillowCurbed's Rob Bear reports that billionaire publishing heir/financier Dirk Ziff has recently listed his Katonah, New York mansion for $8.9 million.  Ziff, who has an estimated net-worth of $4.4 billion, is the eldest son of the late publishing magnate William Ziff, Jr. He and his brothers inherited their father's fortune after he sold 95% of his publishing business to private equity firm Forstmann Little for $1.4 billion. With that money started Ziff Brothers Investments, which invests in a variety of asset classes, private equity and hedge funds, according to Forbes.   The Ziffs also provided seed money to hedge funder Daniel Och. In exchange, they got a 10 percent stake in Och-Ziff, which is now a publicly traded hedge fund. Dirk and his wife, former Forbes reporter Natasha Bacigalupo, bought the manor in 2002 for $6.25 million, records show. FREE AppDownload
