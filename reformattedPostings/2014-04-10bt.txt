YouTubeFinancial professionals are known for working notoriously long hours, which can take a harsh toll on personal lives. Bloomberg Businessweek's new cover story on PIMCO's Bill Gross goes into the hours expended by Mohamed El-Erian, the now former CEO of PIMCO. And it includes an anecdote that'll tug at your heart strings: Things were good for a while. “Mohamed and I, we sort of settled in like a married couple,” Gross says. El-Erian kept even more extreme hours than Gross did, sleeping from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m., spending time on his op-eds and other prolific media output, and hitting the office around 4:30 or 5 a.m. He and Gross corresponded all day—mainly by e-mail, even though they sat next to each other, because Gross doesn’t like to be interrupted. When he wasn’t traveling, El-Erian would move at about 9 a.m. from the trading floor to his office in the executive wing to tackle his management duties. According to former colleagues, El-Erian regularly referred to a list his daughter had made of all the recitals and other milestones he’d missed. Surely, that must've contributed to El-Erian's unexpected resignation from the firm. FREE AppDownload
