This past week was a historic one for fund flows — investors pulled a historic amount out of equity funds while at the same time putting a historic amount into bond funds, and over 95% of the flows were in and out of ETFs. Citi analysts Markus Rosgen and Yue Hin Pong relay the details in a note to clients: U.S. funds had record-high inflow into bonds and outflow from equities — In the week ended 2/5/2014, there was a $14.8 billion inflow into bond funds and a $28.3 billion outflow from equity funds, representing record highs in both cases.

More than 95% of these flows were attributed to ETFs. $6.4 billion of outflow from EM funds — This was the 15th week of outflows from EM equity funds and was the largest outflow since August-2010.
