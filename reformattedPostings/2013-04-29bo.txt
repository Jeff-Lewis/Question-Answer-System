This comes as U.S. economic data continues to signal a spring slowdown.  Q1 GDP grew at a slower pace than expected, durable goods orders disappointed in April, and the housing market is showing signs of slowing. Meanwhile, the current earnings season continues to be less than stellar. Experts have offered two interesting theories for the persistent stock market rally, which we will get to a little later. This week will be loaded with economic data and earnings announcements from around the world. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update So, with the recent economic data disappointing and earnings announcements lagging, what's driving the markets? Analysts have advanced at least two interesting theories. 1) Cash Return: "[D]uring the current earnings season, US corporations continue to announce dividend increases and more share buybacks," said stock market guru Ed Yardeni as he rationalized the rally. "Previously, I’ve shown that this corporate cash flow into the stock market--which totaled $2.1 trillion for the S&amp;P 500 since stock prices bottomed during Q1-2009 through Q4-2012--has been driving the bull market since it began." 2) The End Of Austeriy: "Some traders ... think that the new rally really kicked in when news that a graduate student had found flaws in the Reinhart/Rogoff paper on the limiting power of public debt on the economy – thus casting doubt on that thesis," said UBS's Art Cashin. Cashin is talking about UMass grad student Thomas Herndon, who has basically turned the global austerity movement into a joke. Austerity has been a major drag for economic growth, especially in many of the developed European countries. FREE AppDownload
