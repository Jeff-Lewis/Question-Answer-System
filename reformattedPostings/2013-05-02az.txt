Vanity Fair has gone "Moby Dick" on billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, the founder of $14 billion SAC Capital. In a piece in the June Issue, Byran Burrough and Bethany McLean refer to the fund manager as the "biggest fish" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is going after. They have even included an illustration by André Carrilho to go with the story, "The Hunt for Steve Cohen."  You can download this image as a desktop wallpaper.  As you can see, Cohen looks like he's playing the role of Moby Dick and Bharara is Captain Ahab.  Vanity Fair/ Illustration by André Carrilho Also, here's a cover of the June issue that will be hitting newstands.  Courtesy of Vanity Fair FREE AppDownload
