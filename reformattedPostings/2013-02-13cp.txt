APAs President Barack Obama heads to Asheville, N.C., Wednesday to push the themes outlined in his State of the Union address, the White House has unveiled a four-step plan it claims would make the U.S. a "magnet for jobs" by investing in manufacturing. The White House's plan follows four general guidelines: Investing in American-made technologies; ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas; new partnerships to bring jobs back to America and encourage companies to hire in America; and opening global markets to American-made goods. Obama will outline the plan during his speech in Asheville, where he will visit the Linamar Factory, which produces heavy-duty engine and driveline components. In his State of the Union Tuesday, Obama outlined proposals to revitalize American manufacturing and bring jobs back to the country, including plans to launch manufacturing hubs, that would leverage public-private partnerships to boost technologies and capabilities. Obama said he would begin the initiative with an executive order to launch three additional hubs, and called on Congress to invest $1 billion to create a network of 15 of these hubs.  Here's Obama's full manufacturing plan, via the White House: In his State of the Union, the President outlined a comprehensive agenda to attract more jobs to our shores.
