YouTubePIMCO's Bill GrossFollowing this morning's consumer confidence release, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose to its highest levels in a year as investors sold out of government bonds. Goldman strategists think this time the sell-off in bonds is "for real," and rates should continue heading higher from here. This afternoon, bonds have extended their earlier losses, and the 10-year Treasury is now yielding 2.15%. Closed-end bond funds traded on exchanges are taking a big hit today. Perhaps the most notable is PIMCO's Dynamic Income fund, which is down 4.3%. However, bond funds across the spectrum of PIMCO offerings are under fire. PIMCO's High Income Fund is down 7.0%, the PIMCO Corporate &amp; Income Opportunity Fund is trading 4.9% lower, and the PIMCO Income Strategy Fund is off 2.4%. In a recent tweet, PIMCO fund manager Bill Gross said, "The secular 30-yr bull market in bonds likely ended 4/29/2013. PIMCO can help you navigate a likely lower return 2 - 3% future."
