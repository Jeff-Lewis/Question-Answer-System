Some CNBC and Fox Business News reporters have come out against the $13 billion settlement JP Morgan has negotiated with the Justice Department to settle claims over faulty mortgage products sold in the run-up to the financial crisis. This has put them in the crosshairs of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Last night, Stewart skewered their over-the-top defense of JP Morgan and its CEO, Jamie Dimon.
