ReutersNatural gas prices are up more than 3 percent this morning after the Energy Information Association (EIA) reported a drop in supplies. For the week ended March 1, U.S. reserves fell -146 billion cubic feet. According to Citi's Timothy Evans, the drop in supply was much higher than every forecast: Citi Futures 120 bcfDow Jones Survey 131 bcfReuters Survey 134 bcfBloomberg Survey 134 bcf Five-Year Average 102 bcf Here's the chart: Investing.com Evans calls it a "bullish shock" to the market. Here's his take: The 146 bcf net withdrawal was significantly more than expected, a bullish shock to the market.  There were no reports of reclassifications and so this looks like a straight-up tightening of the background supply/demand balance for the period, with supportive implications that offset today's milder temperature outlook.  The case for a rally to $3.70-3.80 is improved. Prices are not expected to come down for a while. FREE AppDownload
