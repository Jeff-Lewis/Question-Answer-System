Naoya Fujishiro/WIREDFifteen of 22 nations reporting manufacturing data saw gains accelerate in December. At the beginning of each month, Markit, HSBC, RBC, JP Morgan, and other data gathering institutions publish the latest local readings of the purchasing managers index (PMI).  Each reading is based on surveys of hundreds of companies in each country.  We'll be covering most live as they come out. About two-thirds of countries reporting data have seen faster expansions than in November. The global index also edged higher. As a general rule, manufacturing PMI™ surveys are always released on the first working day of each month, construction PMIs on the second working day and services PMIs on the third working day. These are not the most closely followed data points.  However, the power of the insights is unparalleled. Jim O'Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, believes the PMI numbers are among the most reliable economic indicators in the world.
