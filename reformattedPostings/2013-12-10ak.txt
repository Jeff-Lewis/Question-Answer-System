Here's a great chart (courtesy of Rafat Ali) of the 2013 European Union Industrial R&amp;D Scoreboard. It shows the world's top 50 companies ranked by their total research &amp; development investment (in euros). The top R&amp;D investor is the German carmaker Volkswagen (€9.5 billion, $13 billion), which moved up from third place last year. Five U.S. companies made it to the top 10: Microsoft, Intel, Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer. Overall the U.S. had 36 companies among the top 100 R&amp;D investors, the EU had 28, and Japan had 22. Check it out:IRI
