The NFIB's Index of Small Business Optimism jumped to 95.2 in April from 93.4 in March. "This is the first time the Index has reached 95 since October 2007," noted the NFIB.

Small-business owners are a bit more optimistic in this area but still 9 percent more owners expect business conditions to deteriorate than improve." All of this is great news for those who had doubts the economy might struggle to accelerate again after the unusually cold winter. The report included some good insight into the state of the labor market and the availability of credit, a leading indicator of business spending. "Twenty-four (24) percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period (up 2 points)," reported the NFIB. This is a sign of labor-market tightness, which also means that the risk of wage inflation is increasing.

Dan Greenhaus of BTIG notes that on earnings conference calls this quarter, there was a lot of talk about how the economy really picked up after the winter ended. He writes: So small-business optimism is up. Job openings are rising. Credit is more available. And large companies saw a nice comeback in April. Maybe it's real this time? FREE AppDownload
