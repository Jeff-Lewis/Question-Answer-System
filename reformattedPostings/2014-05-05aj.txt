REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz William Ackman, founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, May 5, 2014.Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman made his uberbullish case on Fannie Mae through a 110-slide presentation at the Sohn Investment Conference in NYC today. Fannie Mae is one of the infamous GSEs that needed a huge bailout during the financial crisis due to its role in funding the housing market. It has become profitable again, though it remits its payments back to the government to repay the bailout. A lot of hedge funders are long the stock, betting that ultimately the profits will go back to shareholders and that the government will leave Fannie (and it's sibling Freddie Mac) as is, in their original state. He characterized the investment as "owning a royalty on every mortgage." According to Bloomberg, Ackman said Fannie could be worth $23 to $47 per share. The stock closed at $4.10 today. "There is no viable alternative," said Ackman, noting the firm's critical position in the U.S. mortgage finance market. Ackman is the largest hedge fund shareholder in Fannie with a roughly 10% stake in the company. FREE AppDownload
