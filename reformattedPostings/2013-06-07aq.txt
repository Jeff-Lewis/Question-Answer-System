He shared some photos and memories from his trip to this year's Villa d'Este Concorso d'Eleganza with Business Insider. You can see more of his work here. This year I attended the Villa d'Este Concorso d'Eleganza, an exclusive auto show on the shores of Italy's Lake Como, for the third time. The first day of the Concorso takes place in the gardens of the beautiful Villa d'Este Hotel, and is open only to press and invited guests. On the second day, the cars are moved to Villa Erba, a nearby park, so they can be presented to the public. The extensive parkway is by no means inferior in beauty to the smaller one at the Villa d'Este.  In addition to the show, RM Auctions held an auction at Villa Erba, and made a few wealthy car collectors and investors very happy. But it's not just the cars that make this event so beautiful and unique: It's a mixture of the scenery, the sounds of yesteryear's finest racecars, and the scent of 1930s Rolls-Royce leather upholsteries.
