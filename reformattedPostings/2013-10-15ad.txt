APSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Harry ReidAfter House Republican leadership shelved a vote on legislation to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, the two Senate leaders have re-entered into talks and are close to a deal.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are close to a deal, according to spokesmen for both leaders. A Democratic leadership aide said it's "likely (cross your fingers) that an agreement is coming tonight." That never came, but both sides continue to say it is close. Shortly after 10 p.m. ET, the Senate adjourned until noon on Wednesday. "Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have re-engaged in negotiations and are optimistic that an agreement is within reach," said Adam Jentleson, Reid's spokesman. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said: "Given tonight's events, the Leaders have decided to work toward a solution that would reopen the government and prevent default. They are optimistic an agreement can be reached." Reid and McConnell were discussing a possible agreement on Monday that would fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7. It also set up a budget conference that would end no later than Dec. 13.  A Democratic aide said the deal currently being discussed would include an income-verification system for individuals and families receiving subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. But it won't likely include a one-year delay in the law's "reinsurance tax," a provision that is designed to spread risk among insurers and stabilize premiums in the first three years of the law. The aide also said that under the deal, the Treasury Department will still be able to use "extraordinary measures" to work around the debt ceiling in the case that it is not raised by Feb. 7.  "Should be included and allowed," the aide said.
