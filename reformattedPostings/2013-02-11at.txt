StreetEasyWhen investor Sol Rosenblatt and his wife Victoria purchased this duplex penthouse back in 2001 for $611,000, there was nothing in it — nothing. Luckily, Sol is an engineer, so he was able to fill the place with goodies. Now the three bedroom apartment has a performance space, a hot tub, and a garden to go along with its awesome views and desirable location. Check it out yourself, Robin and Jeremy Stein at Sotheby's have the listing.
