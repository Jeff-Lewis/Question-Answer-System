U.S. crude futures are up more than 1% in Tuesday eastern time trading after the Wall Street Journal reported the Commerce Department approved exports of a form of unrefined oil, which the paper says represents a partial end to America's decades-old crude export ban. WSJ's Christian Berthelsen and Lynn Cook write that two U.S. energy companies have received permission to export a form of petroleum called condensate. Production of condensate has surged alongside the unprecedented output of U.S. shale oil.  U.S. firms have been banned from shipping raw crude since 1975, in the wake of the first Arab oil crisis. But it is legal to export refined products. Clearview Energy's Kevin Book says markets may be overreacting, since it's not clear Commerce has actually made any alteration to the crude ban by allowing condensate to be exported. "The [rulings] do not appear to have redefined condensate" as crude, he told BI in an email.  In a note to clients today, Alembic's James Sullivan predicted something like what WSJ is reporting, saying that it was likely the the Obama administration would make clear that certain hydrocarbons would be defined as condensates and not crude oil.
