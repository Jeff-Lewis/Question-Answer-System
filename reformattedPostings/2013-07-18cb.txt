Investment banking giant Morgan Stanley just released its Q2 financial results. The numbers are a bit noisy. Earning per share adjusted for non-recurring items jumped to $0.45 per share. This was a bit above the $0.43 expected by analysts. Net revenue came in at $8.32 billion, beating expectations for $7.89 billion. Management also announced that they would begin to repurchase $500 million worth of shares. "This quarter, we saw significant year-over-year revenue growth in each of our five major business units and higher year-over-year profitability," said CEO James Gorman. "Of particular note, Equity sales and trading results were strong across all products and regions, while Investment Banking delivered top-three rankings in announced and completed M&amp;A, global equity offerings and global IPOs."   Click Here For The Full Announcement &gt; FREE AppDownload
