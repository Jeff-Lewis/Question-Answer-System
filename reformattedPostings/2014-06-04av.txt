Flickr/AlexFirst off, if you're reading this, good luck. You're going to need it on Saturday. The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams are this weekend. They are commonly known as the most hellish exams taken by Wall Street professionals. Fewer than 20 percent of candidates pass all three tests in the first attempt at each. What makes the CFA so difficult is the sheer volume of information you have to study and use. There are tons of formulas and ideas all over the exam — we couldn't possibly cover it all here. So we'll give you what you absolutely have to know —9 formulas candidates that will most assuredly show up on all three levels of the CFA exam. Don't blow it. NOTE: We don't claim to be an expert in offering exam advice. Ben Duronio also contributed to this post. FREE AppDownload
