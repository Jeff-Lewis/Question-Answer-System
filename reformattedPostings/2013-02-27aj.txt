In a separate December 14 document, the RBA also said its preferred model showed it was 7 percent overvalued.  The information was released in response to a Bloomberg Freedom of Information request (FOIA).  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also said equilibrium rate may fall 1 - 4 percent in two years.
