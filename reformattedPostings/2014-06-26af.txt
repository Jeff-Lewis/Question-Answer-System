REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonA quick search of "Best Cities for Millennials" yields thousands of results, and these articles tend to fall into two types of categories.  The first group highlights all the negative numbers released by the most recent census or unemployment report in an attempt to scare young people.  The second type generally delineates the cultural habits of millennials, showing that there is more to them than unemployment numbers suggest. We've decided to combine the two types into one comprehensive list of the "19 Best Cities for Millennials". On the one hand, we examine the unavoidable realities of being a young adult in the United States, including rising housing and rent prices, unemployment rates, the cost of living, and crime rates. On the other hand, we consider cultural appetites such as the entertainment and sports scenes, the average costs of beer, and where to find the best pizza in America. (Because, pizza.) We combined all these variables into a valuation function to determine a Value According to Millennials Score, or VAM Score. The city that scored the lowest is number 19, and the city that scored the highest is number 1. If you want to read more about how we came up with these numbers, click here.
