Delaware Child Predator Task ForceA now-former 59-year-old Bank of America vice president, Kirk Simmons, was arrested this summer for trying to have sex with a thirteen-year-old girl.   According to The Associated Press, Simmons now wants a public defender because he doesn't have any money in his bank account to pay for a lawyer himself.  Simmons was arrested in July by the Delaware Child Predator Task Force after responding to an online ad for paid sex with a thirteen year-old and making arrangements with her father, DelawareOnline reported. The advertisement was actually created by undercover law enforcement authorities who arranged for a meet-up with Simmons at a Newark motel, the report said. Simmons, who showed up to the location expecting to have sex with the girl, also had a laptop and camera with him, DelawareOnline reported citing investigators. He faces charges related to attempted sex with a minor and attempted child pornography charges, according to  The AP. Simmons worked as a market information manager VP with Bank of America. He was fired after his arrest.  FREE AppDownload
