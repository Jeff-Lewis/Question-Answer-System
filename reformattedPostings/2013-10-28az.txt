FoursquareWe decided to comb through alumni lists of some of the country's top prep schools to find the ones with big name Wall Street alums.  Of course, you don't have to go to a prep school to be successful on the Street just like you don't have to graduate from an Ivy League with a 3.5 GPA either.  We've included our round up in the slides that follow.  If we're missing any big names, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com.  FREE AppDownload
