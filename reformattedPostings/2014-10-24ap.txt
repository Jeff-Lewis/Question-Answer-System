The release of new Social Security Administration wage data gives us a chance to update our analysis of wage trends for the top 1.0% of wage earners and wage groups in the bottom 99.0%. There’s some surprising news this year, as top 1.0% wages fell, while the remainder of the workforce saw real wage improvements. In the analysis below we review these recent trends, as well as trends during the Great Recession and over the longer-term. New data for 2013 (Table 1) provide some surprising news: real average annual wages nudged down slightly, falling 0.2% since 2012, because wages of the top 1.0% of wage earners declined, although those of the bottom 99.0% grew. The biggest wage decline was among the top 0.1% of earners, whose wages fell 9.0%, while the next 0.9% saw their wages fall just 1.4%. In contrast, the wages of the bottom 90% (averaging $32,333 in 2013) rose a modest 0.4% (real hourly wages did grow modestly in 2013). Higher wage workers, those earning between the 90th and 99th%iles of wages (averaging $136,820 in 2013) fared the best, with real wages rising by 2.5%. Thus, wage inequality between high and middle/low wage workers grew even though those at the very top—the 1%ers—actually lost ground. David Cay Johnston wrote on this yesterday. Our analysis goes beyond his reporting by placing earners in%ile wage groups (bottom 90%, top 1%, etc.) and providing analyses of changes over the Great Recession’s downturn and recovery and the longer-term changes back to 1979. Economic Policy Institute What explains the dip in top 1% wages? Without access to the underlying data, this is a difficult task, but here are some thoughts. This stratum of wages is heavily influenced by executive pay trends and, therefore, by the ups and downs of the stock market, which executive pay has closely tracked for the last twenty years. Stock values, judged by the Dow Jones index and the S&amp;P 500, grew strongly (roughly 15%) in 2013, but CEO compensation for the largest firms grew a modest 2.8%. That does not explain a fall in wages though. The fall may be due to some income shifting, as tax rates did rise in 2013 (a new, higher top bracket at 39.6%, and an additional 0.9% Medicare tax on high earners). Those able to probably shifted compensation they would have received in 2013 into 2012 (when top one% wages grew 6.1%). The Wall Street Journal did report that there were “more bonuses paid by firms in December to avoid higher federal tax rates.” If so, then we can expect the 2013 dip in wages to be temporary, and for the wages of the top 1.0% to recover strongly in 2014. Even with these results for 2013, the recovery from the Great Recession (the years since 2009) remains highly unequal in terms of wage growth. The bottom 90% has seen a modest 0.7% loss of wages, while those in the top 1.0% gained 9.9%, and other high earners (between the 90thand 99th percentiles) gained 2.8%. Because the wages of the top 1.0% took the biggest fall in the 2007-09 downturn, however, the highest earners in 2013 had wages that were still 7.2% below their 2007 levels. The bottom 90% has not recovered yet either, with wages down 1.3% since 2007. The only group to make gains since 2007 was wage earners between the 90thand 99th percentiles, whose wages are up 2.5% since 2007. Economic Policy InstituteUnequal wage growth since 1979 The longer-term trends show tremendous disparity in wage growth. Wages of the top 1.0% rose 137.7% from 1979 to 2013, while those of the bottom 90% rose just 15.2%. Within that top 1.0%, the upper 0.1% has experienced even greater growth—289.6% since 1979 (after peaking at 362.5% in 2007). Higher wage earners below the top 1.0% but higher than the bottom 90% saw their wages grow between 37.2% (90th to 95th percentiles) and 59.5% (95th to 99th percentiles). Though average wages for the bottom 90% did grow modestly in 2013, they are still just a blip in the long-term trends of disparate wage growth when compared to the top 1.0%. FREE AppDownload
