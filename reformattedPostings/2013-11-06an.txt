REUTERS/ Brendan McDermidNew York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly is in talks to take the "top security job" at JP Morgan, the New York Post's Mark DeCambre and Beth DeFalco report. Kelly may take the job before mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is sworn in, the Post reports. De Blasio has been an outspoken critic of Kelly' stop-and-frisk policy. From the Post: Kelly’s potential position with JPMorgan Chase would make him responsible for security at the giant financial firm, with emphasis on cyber-security, people familiar with the ongoing talks said.

He worked at Bear Stearns during 2000-2001 as a "managing director for corporate security." Read the full report at the New York Post » FREE AppDownload
