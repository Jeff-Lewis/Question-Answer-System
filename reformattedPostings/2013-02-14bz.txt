David McNew/Getty ImagesThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights that became a law at the start of the year has helped bring down the national foreclosure rate, according to RealtyTrac's latest foreclosure report. Foreclosure filings on U.S. properties were down 7 percent month-over-month, and 28 percent on the year.  "The U.S. foreclosure landscape in January was profoundly altered by the effects of new legislation that took effect in California on the first of the year,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac in a press release.  “Dubbed the Homeowners Bill of Rights, this legislation extends many of the principles in the national mortgage settlement — including a prohibition on so-called dual tracking and requiring a single point of contact for borrowers facing foreclosure — to all mortgage servicers operating in California. ...As a result, the downward foreclosure trend in California accelerated into hyper speed in January, decisively shifting the balance of power when it comes to the nation’s foreclosure activity."
