REUTERS/Noah Berger Elon Musk's upstart automaker has been on a roll today: Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas raised his price target to $320, from $153, sending the stock skyrocketing. And now, Consumer Reports has named the Tesla Model S the best overall car of 2014, it announced this afternoon. Here's why: Sure, you can talk about this electric luxury car’s blistering acceleration, razor-sharp handling, compliant ride, and versatile cabin, which can fit a small third-row seat. But that just scratches the surface of this technological tour de force. The Tesla is brimming with innovation. Its massive, easy-to-use 17-inch touch screen controls most functions. And with its totally keyless operation, full Internet access, and ultra-quiet, zero-emission driving experience, the Tesla is a glimpse into a future where cars and computers coexist in seamless harmony. Its 225-mile driving range and 5-hour charges, using Tesla’s special connector, also make it the easiest, most practical, albeit pricey, electric car to live with. Price as tested: $89,650 The win for the Model S, picked from more than 260 cars tested by Consumer Reports, is no shock: In May 2013, the magazine gave the Model S a 99/100, its best score ever. Here are the rest of the year's winners for each category, with the price as tested. Japanese brands dominated: Small SUV: Subaru Forester ($26,814) Midsized sedan: Honda Accord ($23,270) Compact car: Subaru Impreza (sedan $21,345; hatchback $$22,345) Midsized SUV: Hyundai Santa Fe ($36,290) Green car: Toyota Prius ($26,750) Pickup truck: Ram 1500 ($42,810) Luxury car: Audi A6 ($56,295) Sports sedan: BMW 328i ($43,195) Minivan: Honda Odyssey ($36,830) FREE AppDownload
