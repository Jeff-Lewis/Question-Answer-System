This post is sponsored by The Principal Financial Group.   Whether your plan is to travel the world, start a business, or relax on an island somewhere, you'll have to do a lot of saving and planning before that becomes a reality. And in an expensive city like New York, it can seem almost impossible. So imagine if a financial expert offered to tell you how to make those dreams a reality — for free. That happened to be the case for a few lucky New Yorkers. As part of The Principal Financial Group's "Take Action On Your Financial Dreams" program, locals were given free financial advice from The Principal experts, all in the back of a cab. In this video, a baby boomer worries whether he can save enough money for retirement to last him 30 years, while another rider shares his retirement travel plans. Watch the video to see the advice the experts had to offer.  Learn more at Principal.com. Find out more about Sponsor Posts.  FREE AppDownload
