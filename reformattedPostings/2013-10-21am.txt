Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesMajor U.S. corporations including McDonald's and Starbucks are reinvesting in private jets after several years of delaying upgrades to their aircraft, Bloomberg's Thomas Black reports.  McDonald's purchased a Bombardier Challenger 605 — which carries up to 13 passengers — to replace an existing jet in February, and Starbucks Corp. bought a Gulfstream G550 in June, according to the report. Johnson &amp; Johnson bought the same Gulfstream model, which seats up to 18 passengers, in August. The purchases signify a bright spot in an otherwise bleak outlook for private jet sales, which have remained stagnant throughout the economic downturn after a period of growth in the early 2000s. "The ultra-rich and the bigger corporations came through the downturn of 2008/2009 fine and can still afford expensive biz jets," George Ferguson, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Industries told Black.  "The aspirational buyers had incomes change the most due to the downturn and they haven’t returned to the market."
