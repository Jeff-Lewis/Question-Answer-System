But the bull market likely isn't over — it's just changing. And for investors to thrive in the new, slow-growth world, they'll have to adjust their strategies and be more selective.  OppenheimerFunds believes three kinds of companies will succeed in today's marketplace: "Organic Revenue Generators," which can expand without spending too much; "Efficiency Vendors," which can help others get more value from their operations; and "Innovators," which are breaking entirely new ground.
