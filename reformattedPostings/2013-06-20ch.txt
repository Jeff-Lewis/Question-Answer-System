FinVizStocks, bonds, and commodities around the world are getting hit by a double-whammy. First, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that strengthening economic data could enable the Fed to start tapering, or gradually reducing, its stimulative bond-buying plan. This seemed to be behind a bond market sell-off. Second, China reported that manufacturing activity was decelerating at a higher clip than expected in June.  China is the world's second largest economy and it is also a key source of global economic growth. As such it is also one of the big consumers of commodities. All of this slammed markets in Asia. And now Europe is getting pummeled. And the U.S. markets, where the sell-off began, hasn't finished tumbling.  Dow futures are down by 50 points. FREE AppDownload
