 JPMorgan Chase probably has the broadest — and weirdest — history of any American bank.  Its story includes a role in killing the first secretary of the treasury, helping to win World War I, and contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.  Like the other major Wall Street firms, landing a gig at JPMorgan is a ticket to a higher tax bracket. One example: The investment banking vice president salary is reported as $172,902, and bonuses boost that to $337,121.  To get in the door, just as with the other big banks, it helps to go to the right university.
