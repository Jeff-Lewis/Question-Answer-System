Weekly initial jobless claims came in at 326,000.  Consensus was for a slight decline to 328,000 and a revised 328,000 last week. The 4-week moving average was 335,000, a decrease of 13,500 from the previous week's revised average of 348,500. A bill to extend unemployment insurance for more than a million Americans failed in the Senate yesterday. Here's what it's been looking like recently — it's come up a bit after having printed a "2-handle" — below 300,000 — last month. Barclays commented: "This puts the four-week moving average at 335k, a 13k decline from the prior week and a 30k improvement on a y/y basis.  According to MNI, the Labor Department reported no special factors but noted that the “usual volatility associated with the holiday season had not yet disappeared.”  Claims averaged 327k in November and 359k in December, but the 12-week moving average stands at 339k.  This is the same as the reading at the end of August, which immediately preceded a four-month period of volatility that included the effects of computer system upgrades in California, severe weather, and several holidays.  In our view, this stronger smoothing measure is telling the right story; despite the significant volatility, claims gradually ground lower throughout 2013 and we expect this to continue in the coming year."
