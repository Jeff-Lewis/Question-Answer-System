Business InsiderLast night, Jon Stewart blasted the current goings-on in Davos, Switzerland, as an "orgy of self-congratulatory excess." Few people here saw the broadcast — at that hour, they were too busy drinking or sleeping. But it's fair to say they would have enjoyed it. Then they would have raised a glass to Jon Stewart and roared, "Dude, get over here, you're missing the party!" Tonight, in fact, is the anniversary of the hot-ticket party in Davos last year — a "taxidermy"-themed bash thrown by billionaire entrepreneur Sean Parker, Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff, and Ian Osborne of the London-based communications firm Osborne &amp; Partners. Billed as the "Future Of Philanthropy Nightcap," the party was held in what until recently had been a crappy bar on Davos's main drag. Earlier in the week the bar had been transformed — at a rumored cost of $1 million — into a one-of-a-kind "taxidermy" emporium, with stuffed animals and animal heads on many of the walls. There was a wine bar in one corner. And a team of bartenders called "Liquid Chef" had been flown in from London. John Legend (also flown in) was playing. There were said to be three levels of restricted rooms below the main level that only certain guests had access to (I didn't). And there was, as you will see, an eclectic mix of guests. I generally feel about two decades too old to fully appreciate parties like these, but last year's guests included some folks who were two decades younger and some who were two decades older than me.  Here are some pictures. Apologies in advance for the lousy quality. I'll try to get better ones when I go to another Davos-ending bash in the same transformed bar tonight.
