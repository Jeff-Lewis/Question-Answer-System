A letter circulating among U.S. Senate Democrats in support of Janet Yellen's candidacy to succeed Ben Bernanke as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bloomberg reports. It was drafted by Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and it is said to have signatures of other Democrats. Bernanke's term ends this year, and many expect him to retire. Yellen, who is currently the Vice Chair of the Fed, has been long considered the favorite for the position. But in more recent periods, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has emerged as someone who could also take the vacated spot. Just yesterday, Ezra Klein wrote a piece titled "Right now, Larry Summers is the front-runner for Fed Chair." "President Obama really likes Summers," said Klein. "And he’s surrounded by Summers’s longtime colleagues and friends." Earlier today, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi praised Yellen during an interview with Bloomberg's Al Hunt. "I think it would be great to have a woman — first woman chairman of the Fed, no question about it," she said. "She's extremely talented. It's not just that she's a woman." FREE AppDownload
