It's wall-to-wall Uber in the news these days, with threats and privacy gaffes and pay controversies and tweetstorms and calls for senior executives' heads. Meanwhile, Uber's "ruthless execution" and financial performance continue to astound those who are privvy to them.  As we reported last week, sources familiar with Uber's numbers say Uber is growing revenue at 300% per year and is expected to hit an annual run-rate of $10 billion by the end of next year. Also, meanwhile, Uber is in the middle of another gigantic round of financing. Here's what we're hearing about the latter: Inquiring minds may also wonder why Uber keeps raising so much money. After all, there are few hard costs in the business other than software and legal and lobbying fees to fend off local governments and taxi unions. (Uber doesn't own cars). The answer is that Uber is using cash as a competitive weapon. When a competitor enters an Uber market, one investor in an Uber-competitor says, Uber immediately and radically cuts its prices. Uber then happily loses money on each ride, knowing that the new competitor, with inferior scale, will lose even more money on each ride. Uber bleeds the competitor until the competitor realizes that Uber will do whatever it takes to crush it. The competitor then often gives up and withdraws — and Uber raises its prices again. It takes a lot of cash to compete that way, but Uber has lots of cash. And after this round, it will have even more cash. Anecdotally, investors are as awe-struck by Uber's growth rate and execution as they are appalled by the company's arrogance and scorched-earth approach to critics and competitors. Thus far, anyway, the latter has not stopped investors from clamoring to climb aboard the magic Uber money machine. SEE ALSO: Now I Know Why Investors Are Going Hog Wild About Uber FREE AppDownload
