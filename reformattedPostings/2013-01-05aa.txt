But there is no shortage of people who get paid to make a prediction Fourteen of Wall Street's best sell-side equity strategist have published their 2013 year-end targets for the S&amp;P 500. Some calls were bearish, like Wells Fargo's Gina Martin Adams who sees the S&amp;P falling to 1,390. Others were bullish, like Citi's Tobias Levkovich who sees the S&amp;P heading to 1,615.
