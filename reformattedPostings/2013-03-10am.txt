The national unemployment rate fell from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent this week, after a strong Non-Farm Payrolls report. But the unemployment rate differs greatly for people with different levels of education. From Bill McBride at Calculated Risk, here's the latest look at the differing levels of unemployment by level of educational attainment.
