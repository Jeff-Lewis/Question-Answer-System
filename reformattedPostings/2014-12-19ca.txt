The eurozone is about to fall into deflation, but that's not the most amazing problem the continent has had with its money. This amazing graphic from Goldman Sachs researchers shows just how severe hyperinflation was in Germany during the 1920s.

Germany's post-World War I hyperinflation actually breaks the chart. The inflation was so severe that at the time, doctors thought it caused a mental illness in which patients couldn't stop writing zeros.  According to "This Time Is Different," a book by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, inflation peaked at over 200 billion percent — billion with a "b" — in 1923.  Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
