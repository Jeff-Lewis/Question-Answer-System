Tom Keene on InstagramBloomberg TV's Tom Keene, the anchor of "Surveillance," is really, really tall.  Business Insider staff have met him in person before, but only recently noticed how incredibly tall he is when he was in Davos, Switzerland last week for the World Economic Forum.  He made JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Nouriel Roubini look super short, and both of them are normal sized people. To see if Keene had the same effect on other people he came in contact with, Business Insider collected pictures of him with co-workers and industry folk. Once you see these pictures, you'll get the picture. FREE AppDownload
