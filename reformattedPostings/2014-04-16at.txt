As the saying goes, do what you love and love what you do ... and make bank while doing it. For our second annual list of the 50 Best Employers in America, Business Insider used data gathered and crunched by PayScale to evaluate companies on pay and happiness. And for the second year in a row, Celgene Corporation topped the list. Companies in the 2012 Fortune 500 were ranked using PayScale's salary and survey database. Final scores were determined by multiplying the companies' performance on six criteria: high job satisfaction, low job stress, high work-schedule flexibility, high job meaning, experienced median pay, and salary delta (that is, how the median pay compares to other companies in the same industry). Since we think that pay is one of the most important factors, we double-weighted pay in our calculations. Read the full methodology here. Did your employer make the list?
