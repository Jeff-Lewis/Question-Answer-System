The Northfield, Illinois-based company said the recall affects four varieties of Kraft American Singles Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product. The recall is for products with "Best When Used By" dates of Feb. 20, 2015, and Feb. 21, 2015. A supplier did not store an ingredient in accordance with Kraft's temperature standards. While unlikely, this could create conditions that could lead to premature spoilage and food-borne illness, the company said. Kraft said that any of the product in question should not be consumed and should be returned to the store where purchased for an exchange or full refund. Kraft said it has had no consumer illness complaints for the product associated with the recall. The cheese was produced at Kraft’s Springfield, Missouri, facility.   (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
