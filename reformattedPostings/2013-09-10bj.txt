flickr/cobalt123Gold is getting slammed down this morning – along with bonds and oil – as signs that the conflict in Syria may de-escalate emerge. Right now, the metal is down 1.9% to $1360 an ounce. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are down 2.2% to $107.10 a barrel. 10-year U.S. Treasury futures are down 0.4%, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury, at 2.96%, is 5 basis points higher from yesterday's close.
