REUTERS/Luke MacGregor European markets opened under a cloud this morningA succession of gloomy news stories have European markets down this morning. France’s CAC 40 is leading the drop, down by 1.62% so far this morning, after yet another PMI drop for the struggling economy. The FTSE 100 is following, with a 1.26% decline.  The pressure on Tesco still isn’t letting up, down by nearly 4%, and shares in pharmaceuticals firm Shire are down 6% on fears that the company’s acquisition by AbbVie will be caught up in a US crackdown on tax inversions. The Dax is also down by more than 1%. Though the PMI reading for Germany wasn’t too severe, at 54, the manufacturing number was the lowest in 15 months, a bad signal for the export-heavy economy. Amsterdam’s AEX is down 0.63%, Spain’s Ibex is down 1.12%, and Sweden’s OMX is down 0.56% Rabobank’s financial research analysts sent out a note this morning titled “desperately seeking good news,” and that’s certainly what it feels like this morning.  FREE AppDownload
