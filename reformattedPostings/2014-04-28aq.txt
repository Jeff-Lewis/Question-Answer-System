NELP Here's a really important chart from the National Employment Law Project, spotted by FT Alphaville's Cardiff Garcia. It's from a report called "The Low-Wage Recovery: Industry Employment and Wages Four Years into the Recovery."  It plots median hourly wage in 2013 dollars in about two dozen different sectors against the net change in employment from Feb. 2010 to March 2014 in those sectors. Right away, you'll notice the data slope downward, meaning payroll growth in higher-wage jobs has not kept up with growth in lower-paying ones. BI's Mamta Badkar expanded on this point, here. But when we look at the bubbles furthest to the left — meaning the sectors with the greatest absolute job losses — what do we see? Government gigs. As the NELP authors write: Over the past four years, private sectors gains have been partially offset by public sector job losses  resulting from budget cuts at the federal, state, and local levels. Net job losses totaled 627,000 across all  levels of government during the recovery period. Employment declines were particularly severe at the local level, where education absorbed nearly three-quarters of the 378,000 net job losses over the past four  years. And government jobs tend to be higher paying. So if you've lost your job working for the county, not only are you not likely to get that job back anytime soon, many of the new posts you interview for are likely going to come with a lower wage. We now know a primary culprit behind the anemic labor market. FREE AppDownload
