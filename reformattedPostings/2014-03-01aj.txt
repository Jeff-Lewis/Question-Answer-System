Fortune.com, Berkshire Hathaway, Business InsiderThe page on the left comes from Fortune.com. The page on the right comes from Berkshire Hathaway. Earlier this week, Warren Buffett gave Fortune Magazine an exclusive clip of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The excerpt included "fundamentals of investing" that Buffett had identified. Fortune had these five bullets (emphasis added): Oddly, that same excerpt was formatted slightly differently in the full letter, which was released earlier today. Specifically, the Buffett's actual letter has the paragraph following the fifth bullet bulleted itself. Fortune did not have it bulleted (see the screengrabs above). We're probably overthinking this. But bear with us. Here's the bullet: Not bulleted, this comment from Buffett can be seen as some extra context for the investments he was discussing. Bulleted, however, it effectively comes off as a sixth fundamental of investing. "What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following – 1987 and 1994 – was of no importance to me in making those investments," he said. "I can’t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time." As a "fundamental," Buffett may be telling us that near-term moves in economic growth, rates, and stocks will mean little in the long-run. We'll update you if we hear back from Buffett or Fortune.
