There has been a lot of talk lately about adding push barriers to the subway system in New York City after multiple incidents received a lot of media attention.  Some subway systems around the world are outfitted with push barriers, but what would it look like in NYC? Here's a 2007 digital illustration from Crown Infrastructure that shows what a safety system would look like if installed at a Grand Central subway platform (on the 7 line): AP / Crown Infrastructure And here's what the 7 platform looks like now: Wikimedia Commons Will it ever happen? In a statement, the MTA said that it was unlikely: Based on the MTA's preliminary analysis, the challenge of installing platform edge barriers in the New York City subway system would be both expensive and extremely challenging given the varied station designs and the differences in door positions among some subway car classes. But in light of recent tragic events, we will consider the options for testing such equipment on a limited basis. Of course, we remind customers of the overall safety of the subway system but urge them to stand well back from the platform edge and remain watchful of their surroundings. The MTA won't cite a specific number, but the installation could cost more than $1 million per station, according to Alex Goldmark of Transportation Nation. New York's subway system has 468 stations.
