Facebook is having a huge day after its big Q4 earnings beat. The stock was up 20% pre-market, and is now trading up 16%. That got market folks thinking where exactly this ranked among big one-day moves upward. "Gobsmacked that Facebook is up almost 20% in pre-market," tweeted Paul Kedrosky. "Has a company at $100b+ market cap every moved this much?" While it's true Facebook doesn't rank among the big guns, it's interesting that that these major market-cap moves happened during the dotcom boom.
