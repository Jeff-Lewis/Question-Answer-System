Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary Stocks remain near all-time highs, and strategists generally expect modest gains for the year. However, Goldman Sachs' Stuart Kaiser thinks some stocks (40 of them to be specific) should do better than others. "Lower valuation stocks have outperformed peers by an average of 420 bp in 1Q during the past 35 years vs. just 170 bp in all other quarters," said Kaiser. "Buying laggards has also performed well early in the calendar year, which is notable given the strategy’s extremely poor long-term cumulative returns." Goldman's house view is that the S&amp;P 500 tops out at 1,900 this year. FREE AppDownload
