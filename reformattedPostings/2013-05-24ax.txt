Many Americans continue to struggle, even four years after the height of the financial crisis. However, America's leaders should be praised for at least doing a better job than their counterparts in Europe. Take the unemployment rate. "The labour market is an example of the divergent performance between the two regions," wrote Deutsche Bank's economists in their new House View report. "Unemployment stood at roughly the same level in mid-2009. Since then, US unemployment has edged down to 7.5% while Eurozone unemployment has risen to record highs of 12.1%" So, as bad as things are in the U.S., they could be a lot worse.
