Over the last few years, investors benefited from paying close attention to the August Jackson Hole conference hosted by the Kansas City Fed. Central bankers, and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in particular, used the occasion to signal possible and important policy changes. Judging from information just circulated by the Wall Street Journal, this year’s gathering is unlikely to be a market mover. But this does not mean it should be ignored. At least two things immediately stand out when you look at the draft agenda for this August 22-24 event, especially when compared to prior ones: the lack of Fed speakers/panelists; and the participation of foreign central bankers. We knew that Mr. Bernanke was going to miss this year’s conference. We just learned that the role of his FOMC colleagues may be limited – to chairing as opposed to presenting a speech or participating in a panel. Indeed, when it comes to the official sector, the latter two roles are allocated mainly to foreign central banks (and especially those from emerging economies). As a result, and given where today’s major monetary policy uncertainty lies, we should not expect market moving news out of this year’s Jackson Hole. Yet investors would be well advised to pay attention to some of the academic/policy discourse – particularly pertaining to the transmission of unconventional monetary policy, global liquidity flows and cross-border effects, and the reconciliation of national and international policy objectives. This may well provide some clues on the many still-unresolved issues associated with prolonged reliance on experimental monetary policies. Remember, it is not as if central bankers have a really good handle on the impact of unconventional policies and the path ahead. They too are dealing with major reconciliation challenges, cyclical/secular inconsistencies, tricky policy pivots and therefore, to use Mr. Bernanke’s famous phrase, “an unusually uncertain outlook.” FREE AppDownload
