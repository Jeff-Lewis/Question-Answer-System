Green Car ReportsDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co &lt;GM.N&gt; on Wednesday said that it has told its North American dealers to stop selling new and used Chevrolet Cruze sedans from model years 2013 and 2014 because of a potential problem with the airbags. The biggest U.S. automaker has not at this point recalled the cars in consumer hands, and is investigating how many vehicles have a faulty part for the airbags in the sedans, said a GM spokesman. GM said it does not yet know whether there have been any crashes, injuries or deaths related to this issue.     (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Chris Reese) FREE AppDownload
