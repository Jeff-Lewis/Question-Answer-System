EMC on Wednesday announced that it would be buyout out a joint venture with Cisco known as VCE. VCE sells computer systems that combine storage tech from EMC, server software from VMware and computer and networking hardware from Cisco. Bloomberg tech reporter Dina Bass broke the news Tuesday night via a  tweet, "The EMC news is...that they are buying out most of Cisco's stake in their VCE joint venture, which will now become part of EMC, sources say" That's interesting. The rift between Cisco and EMC has gotten wider since EMC subsidiary VMware has been trying to take down Cisco's core business with a new technology called "software-defined networking." EMC has been under pressure to split VMware off from investor Elliott Management. It looks like, instead of splitting up, EMC is doubling down on its "federation" strategy, where it owns controlling interests in multiple companies. By buying out most of Cisco's stake in VCE, for terms undisclosed, the EMC federation now consists of four companies: EMC (one of the world's biggest makers of computer storage systems), Pivotal (a big-data startup run by former VMware CEO Paul Martiz), VMware and now, VCE. EMC says that VCE is on a "$2 billion run-rate" meaning if sales keep up at their current pace, VCE should generate $2 billion in annual revenue. Cisco hasn't completely given up this baby, it will keep a 10% stake. But now that VMware has become a full-on competitor with Cisco, it makes sense that one of them would want to nab control over their joint venture. VCE has intimate knowledge of both company's products and product road maps, which they would prefer not to share with one another at this point. FREE AppDownload
