Flickr/n.bhupinderMicrosoft CEO Satya NadellaMicrosoft earnings are out, and they're solid.  Here are the two numbers that matter: The stock was up 4% after hours. We spoke with Chris Suh, head of investor relations at Microsoft after the report. He said the company did well across the board, but revenue growth was driven by its consumer group. In particular, hardware sales. This quarter includes Nokia sales, which didn't exist a year ago. However, even if you back out Nokia phone sales, Microsoft revenue was up 11%, says Suh.  Another thing that helped was the Xbox business, which doubled on a year-over-year basis thanks to a new console. Suh said that Microsoft's Surface business was "slightly" profitable on a gross margin basis. So, what does that mean? Gross Margin just means revenue minus the cost to build.  It doesn't include marketing costs, which are pretty massive for Microsoft with the Surface. All those Surfaces on NFL sidelines aren't free. So, the Surface is losing money overall. But, it seems to be trending in the right direction. Also of note, the phone business is also losing money, though it's not broken out in the release. It's not all hardware for Microsoft, of course. Its cloud businesses represented by Office 365 and Azure grew 128%. Last quarter Microsoft said those businesses were on a $4.4 billion revenue run rate. It didn't break out numbers this quarter, but Suh it was bigger this quarter than last. (Office 365 is the bigger of the two businesses, but Azure is catching up.) Suh said that the reason EPS dropped on a year-over-year basis due to restructuring charges. Suh says that if you back out those charges, then the company's EPS grew.  Here are Microsoft's bullet points from the report.  Microsoft FREE AppDownload
