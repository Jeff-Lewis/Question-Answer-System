Google Images&gt;Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr is trying to come up with ways to plug the city's estimated $18.5 billion debt problem.

Unusual among major cities, Detroit owns the entire collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts.

The group came up with a final tally of at least $2.5 billion.  We wanted to dig into the collection to get a better sense of what the city could end up losing. FREE AppDownload
