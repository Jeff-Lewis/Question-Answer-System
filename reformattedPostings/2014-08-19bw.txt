Oil revenues are a lifeline for the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, whose peshmerga forces are being supported by U.S. air strikes in their battle against the radical Sunni militants of Islamic State. "Work to increase the capacity will probably be completed by the end of this month. Once it is completed, pumping can increase to up to 220,000 barrels per day (bpd)," one Turkish official told Reuters. Industry sources also said the capacity of the pipeline, which began operating at the start of this year, was set to rise to around 200,000-220,000 bpd from 100,000-120,000 bpd before the flow stopped for upgrade work. The KRG began independently exporting its crude via the Turkish Mediterranean export terminal of Ceyhan in May, a move that has infuriated Baghdad, which claims the sole authority to manage Iraqi oil. Baghdad has tried to block KRG's oil sales and prevented some cargoes from discharging through legal action, but the Kurdish enclave has managed to load seven export cargoes from Ceyhan, according to Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. So far, 7.8 million barrels of Kurdish oil have flowed through the independent pipeline, of which 6.5 million have been loaded onto tankers for export.  (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk and Orhan Coskun; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Jane Baird) FREE AppDownload
