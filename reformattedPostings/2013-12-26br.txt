The Bureau of Labor Statistics is out with a new report today showing how employment will change in different industries. Not surprisingly, health care and social assistance sector will see the largest increase in employment adding five million jobs between 2012 and 2022. The construction industry will see an equally substantial rise, growing at a rate of 2.6% annually. On the other side, employment in the agricultural sector is expected to shrink by nearly three percent a year during that time frame. The federal government will shrink substantially as well.
