The latest trends in rail traffic showed more of the same that we’ve been seeing for the last few months. Interestingly, despite the Ebola scare and the brief Europe shock, there was no substantive change in rail trends. The latest weekly reading came in at 3% which is just below the 12 week moving average of 4.3%.  That’s down marginally over the last few months, but still a strong reading in the grand scheme of things.  Via AAR: “WASHINGTON, D.C. – Oct. 23, 2014 – The Association of American Railroads (AAR) today reported increased U.S. rail traffic for the week ending Oct. 18, 2014 with 297,130 total carloads, up 2.7 percent compared with the same week last year. Total U.S. weekly intermodal volume was 272,554 units, up 3 percent compared with the same week last year. Total combined U.S. weekly rail traffic was 569,684 carloads and intermodal units, up 2.9 percent compared with the same week last year.” AAR via Pragmatic Capitalism FREE AppDownload
