Twitter @nictradesThere are a bunch of ways to get high-speed information about markets. Most of them — like getting a Bloomberg terminal, for instance — will cost you an arm and a leg. Thankfully, there's Twitter. It's become a place where even the biggest names on Wall Street go to get a word (or 143 characters) out into the universe, and it can move markets. Business Insider has compiled a list of the best of financial Tweeters for you to use. These are people we follow all day, and if you're going to get serious about using this awesome tool, you should follow them too. Or even better, you join the conversation yourself. But you'd better add some value. FREE AppDownload
