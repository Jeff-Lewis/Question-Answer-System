www.barnesandnoble.comWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Charlie Munger were on CNBC this morning. The host, Becky Quick, asked each what they've been reading lately. Here are their answers: Bill Gates: "Reinventing American Health Care: How the Affordable Care Act will Improve our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System." Gates has a big interest in healthcare (especially internationally), and this book is about exorbitant healthcare costs in the U.S and what can be done about them. Charlie Munger: "Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics." This book is about science, and Munger called it a great achievement. Warren Buffett: "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises." This is Tim Geithner's forthcoming book. It's about the crisis, and Buffett says it's a must-read for anyone in management.
