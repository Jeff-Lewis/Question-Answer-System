WikipediaFor Throwback Thursday, the first day of spring, and just three weeks until income tax returns are due, I offer up this vintage 1948 Federal income tax for 1040. My friend — whose grandfather worked in the steel industry in Youngstown, Ohio — found his old tax return and thought Bankers Anonymous readers would get a kick out of it. I don’t know why I get a kick out of it, but I do. Some things remain the same from those times until now, including incurring a ‘loss’ on rental property. That trick never goes out of style. Rents, however, have gone up considerably since the $210/year for a duplex rate in 1948. I can see on the form that he bought the duplex for $11,000 in 1948, so I guess he didn’t need to make that much in rent. His income as a machinist for the Truscan Steel Company totaled $4,285, and since he’d already had $281.90 withheld, he qualified for a refund of $57.46, according to this return. Hopefully he stayed far away from the 1948 equivalent of an H&amp;R Block refund anticipation loan. The biggest change from then until now — besides the nominal level of prices — is the relative simplicity of the tax form. It looks like he filled this out in about 10 minutes. As I look forward (with dread) to spending hours gathering tax information this coming week, only to pay thousands to my accountants, I wish doing one's taxes were not so complicated. The complication itself leads to suboptimal outcomes. Bankers AnoymousYoungstown, Ohio Tax Form 1948  This article originally appeared at Bankers Anonymous.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
