Dan Lacher/FlickrEuropean stocks are just barely up early Thursday, while Barclays' shares were down 3.2% after the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the bank.  Britain's FTSE 100 is up 0.05%. France's CAC 40 is up 0.02%. Germany's DAX is up 0.05%. Spain's IBEX is up 0.03%. Asian markets closed in the green with Japan's Nikkei up 0.27% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.45%. US futures are flat.  The lawsuit against Barclays alleges that the bank's US-based alternative trading system, or "dark pool," favored high-frequency traders.  “Barclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters. According to the lawsuit, Barclays’ dark pool was full of predators – there at Barclays’ invitation,” Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Wednesday. FREE AppDownload
