Economic reports are piling up to suggest the U.S. economy is heading for yet another spring slowdown. This week will be loaded with more economic reports and a wave of earnings announcements.  Companies like General Electric, Bank of America, McDonald's, Google, and Johnson &amp; Johnson will publish their quarterly financial results. Everyone will be watching carefully for clues suggesting the spring slowdown is really happening.  If it is happening, then we may have already seen the top form for the stock market.
