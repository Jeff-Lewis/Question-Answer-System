Michael VahrenweldNew York-based photographer Michael Vahrenwald has an eye for the eerie. In his travels he's collected pictures of once-majestic bank buildings far removed for their former glory. From McDonalds' to churches, these spaces have been repurposed for the everyday needs of the neighborhoods around them. It's all captured in a series called "The People's Trust."
