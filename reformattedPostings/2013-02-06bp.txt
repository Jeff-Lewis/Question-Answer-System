Comrade Foot via flickrWomen make up half of the workforce, yet they're still hugely underrepresented on corporate boards.  "There must be cohesiveness on the board to get the work moving forward," Carol Evans, CEO of the National Association for Female Executives (NAFE), told us. "Women add their own perspectives, experience and knowledge to the board, which cannot be found any other way than by having gender diversity." And having women on boards just makes good business sense. Research shows that companies perform better when they have more female executives.  To identify which companies most support women in leadership roles, NAFE asked for nominations from the public, which required applicants to answer more than 200 questions about female representation at their companies. Of the 200 applications submitted, NAFE narrowed the list down to the top 50, which is featured in this month's issue of Working Mother.  Thanks to NAFE for also sharing the list with Business Insider. FREE AppDownload
