HBO / Helen SloanJoffrey Baratheon, "Game of Thrones"Self-interest motivates Adam Smith's invisible hand, but economists may be taking it way too seriously. A blog post by Adam Grant in Psychology Today explores how economics majors are, on average, awful human beings. Grant quotes a study by three Cornell professors which provides evidence that economists are less charitable, more deceitful and less likely to be concerned with fairness. From the post: "Along with directly learning about self-interest in the classroom, because selfish people are attracted to economics, students end up surrounded by people who believe in and act on the principle of self-interest. Extensive research shows that when people gather in groups, they develop even more extreme beliefs than where they started. Social psychologists call this group polarization. By spending time with like-minded people, economics students may become convinced that selfishness is widespread and rational<U+2015>or at least that giving is rare and foolish." So it's not really the economists' fault. Spending hours debating the pros and cons of an economic theory will just do that to a person.  FREE AppDownload
