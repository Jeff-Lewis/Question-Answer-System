Last night, Elon Musk, the Tesla Motors founder and real-life Tony Stark, joined Stephen Colbert to discuss what’s going on with his cars and rockets. He also demos a rocket that takes off and then lands in the exact same spot – a critical breakthrough for space travel that would lower the cost of missions dramatically. Check out all three videos below and then a special surprise! Part I:  Part II:  Mars discussion (web exclusive):  Wanna see something cool? Here’s Stephen interviewing Elon back in 2010. He’s trying to explain SpaceX and Tesla electric cars; it’s amazing how everything he said he would do actually worked out! "We have a sedan under development which is about half the price [of the roadster], and then the 3rd generation will be half again as low as that, so it may be under $30,000," Musk says. "That’s really our target in the long term, is to make mass-market electric cars."  Musk also talks about SpaceX's goal of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA has since chosen SpaceX as one of three private firms to do just that. They're still testing the equipment, but the first crew shuttle mission is likely to happen sometime next year.
