"With job and income conditions improving steadily, private consumption is firm as a trend. The downturn in spending, which came in reaction to pent-up demand ahead of the tax hike, appears to be easing," Iwata said in speech to business leaders in Kanazawa, a city in Ishikawa prefecture in central Japan. The BOJ has stood pat since deploying an intense burst of monetary stimulus in April last year, when it pledged to double base money via aggressive asset purchases to achieve its 2 percent inflation target in roughly two years. A former academic, Iwata has been a vocal advocate of a monetary policy targeting base money.
