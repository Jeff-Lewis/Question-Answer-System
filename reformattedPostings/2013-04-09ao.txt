A Hamptons real estate brokerage firm just got the ultimate revenge on a pair of Wall Streeters. [via Curbed] Broker Rosehip Partners, which has the blog Hamptons Marketwire, writes that Jon Terracciano, an attorney, and Jon Shechtman, a hedge fund portfolio manager, tried to cheat one of its agents out of earning a $3,000 commission fee for a summer share. Terracciano is a Wall Street attorney, according to his LinkedIn.  You can see Terracciano partying it up in the Hamptons in this Guest of a Guest photo. Shechtman is a portfolio manager at Axonic Capital, according to his LinkedIn. Anyway, the pair inquired about some high end rental properties promising "all cash for a quick deal," according to the blog.   We're told that they were asking about 25 homes in the brokerage firm's system and an agent worked really hard making calls and arranging tours.  The agent took the two Jons to some houses last Saturday. He felt confident that they would put in an offer.  According to the brokerage, the pair were leaving handwritten notes in the homes telling the homeowners that they would like to do an all cash deal directly with the owner, while cutting out the agents. Two homeowners found the notes and turned them over to Rosehip Partners, says the firm. We have tried reaching out to both individuals to get their side of the story.  The notes have been posted on Rosehip Partners' blog.  They gave us permission to run them.  HamptonsMarketwire Hamptons Marketwire Hamptons Marketwire FREE AppDownload
