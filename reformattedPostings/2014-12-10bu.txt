CrockettandJones1 via YouTubeLet's not kid ourselves — it's pretty hard to match the right pair of shoes to your pants. So we've put together the list for you, using the help of guide posted earlier. Never look like a schlub again. (You're welcome.) Insider Picks If you're wearing shorts, you should keep your shoes casual. Sperrys and other boat shoes are generally the go-to option. You can also go for casual sneakers like Vans or Supergas — and if you are so inclined, feel free to go for a brighter color here. Last, men's espadrilles are a good choice, too. They're breathable and light so they're best for a really hot day. Sperry Top-Sider Men's Authentic Original Boat Shoes — Price: $44.99 to $95.00 Vans Classic Authentic Men's Sneaker (white) — Price: $34.04 to $69.98 TOMS Men's Classic Rope Slip On — Price: $35.60 to $99.99 Insider Picks Sometimes you need to dress up your jeans, and other times you can go super casual. If it's the former, then get yourself some oxfords. But if you're doing the whole jeans-and-tee shirt thing, high top sneakers or even some printed sneakers work. Bass Men's Buckingham Oxford — Price: $62.50 to $113.94 New Balance Men's 574 Classics Running Shoe — Price: $74.95 to $133.73 Converse Men's Chuck Taylor All Star Hi SneakerPrice: $34.95 to $162.76  Insider Picks When it comes to casual chinos, you generally want to stay towards the camp mocs and penny loafers genre. Chukkas are also a solid option — but don't try and buy some weird color. Occasionally, if you're in a particularly casual setting, some sort of basic sneakers are a nice option too. We recommend navy colored ones, as navy pairs nicely with the casual chino. Eastland Men's Yarmouth One Eye Camp Moc — Price: $55.99 to $99.95 PUMA Suede Classic Sneaker — Price: $27.99 to $88.00 Sebago Men's Wicklow Penny Oxford — Price: $79.97 to $135.00 Clarks Originals Men's Desert Boot — Price $39.99 to $149.00 Insider PicksEvery man needs a good pair of shoes for dress trousers — these are for your more dressed up occasions. Now in this case, you should stay far, far away from sneakers and other casual types of shoes. There are lots of different options you can go with — it just depends what you prefer. And if you're looking for monkstraps, we recommend staying away from the single-strap and tripe-strap options. Cole Haan Men's Lionel Longwing Oxford Dress Shoe — Price: $189.98 to $239.99 Florsheim Men's Castellano Wingtip Oxford — Price: $89.99 to $125.00 Donald J Pliner Men's Belen Monk Strap Flat — Price: $189.95 to $199.99 Church's Medallion Cap-Toe Brogues — Price: $545.99 Barneys New York Plain Toe Blucher — Price: $495.00 Insider PicksAnd finally, for suits. Sort of similar to the dress trouser situation, however when it comes to suits and work situations, it's best to err on the side of conservative. Saks Fifth Avenue Wholecut Leather Balmoral Shoes — Price: $478.00 Barneys New York Cap Toe Balmoral — Price: $295.00 Church's Edgware Cap-Toe Balmorals — Price: $535.00  Barneys New York Perforated Cap Toe Balmoral — Price: $495.00 Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
