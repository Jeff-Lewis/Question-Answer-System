In January, they were trading below $15. We've noticed a lot of interest from readers and investors in recent weeks as the virtual currency has gone parabolic. However, as of yet, we only know of one Wall Street analyst who has taken up writing about Bitcoin: ConvergEx Group Chief Market Strategist Nick Colas. Naturally, we were curious what Colas was hearing from his clients, who we figured must be asking some questions as well. Here is what Colas told us (emphasis added): The reaction from clients has been pretty uniform: it must be a bubble. Too far, too fast, too new … you get the idea.  Moreover, it’s very hard to short Bitcoins, so there’s no real way to express that pessimistic point of view, which is saving a lot of people some real money, since Bitcoin has some solid momentum just now. Where is all of the momentum behind the Bitcoin trade coming from? Colas bullets a few points: The term "perfect storm" fits here, even if it is a bit of a cliche at this point, says Colas. Where it goes next is anyone's guess, but Colas thinks the next big thing to watch out for will be whether mainstream businesses start accepting Bitcoin as payment in a more widespread fashion.
