Flickr/skinnylawyerCaesars Las Vegas.Caesars shares are going insane, gaining as much as 19% in after hours trade on Wednesday. Shares of the casino operator popped on Wednesday after a report from Bloomberg's Laura Keller, citing two people with knowledge of the plans, said that Caesars Entertainment has presented a plan to restructure the debt of its largest unit, Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., into a real estate investment trust. A real estate investment trust, typically called a REIT, is a corporate structure that only invests only in real estate and trades on a public exchange, like a stock, generating income through rent collection and paying out at least 90% of its taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Keller's report said Caesars would announce this news on Wednesday, and the company has now filed with the SEC disclosing this plan. In its filing, Caesars said the proposal was made to a "non-extending bank creditor" holding debt in Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. to turn this unit into a REIT. The filing says this plan was first proposed on October 28, but has now expired and been superseded by subsequent plans. Keller's report said that Caesars elected to make the plan public after Silver Point Capital exited restructuring talks with Caesars, making them the second lender to walk away from talks in the last month.  Caesars proposal would've seen CEOC's senior bond holders recoup 100 cents on the dollar, while first lien bondholders would've gotten 93.8 cents on the dollar in a mix of cash, debt, and equity.  FREE AppDownload
