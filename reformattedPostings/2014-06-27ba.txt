REUTERS/Mike SegarGoPro is surging again today. Shares of the wearable camera company were up more than 20% in mid-morning trade, a move that follows yesterday's 30% advance. On Wednesday night, shares of GoPro priced at $24 in their initial public offering, valuing the company at about $3 billion. Yesterday, shares of GoPro closed above $31, and at midday Friday, the stock was trading at about $38 bringing its market cap to more than $4.6 billion. According to its prospectus filed with the SEC, GoPro earned $0.47 per share in 2013, making the company's price to earnings ratio, or roughly how much investors have to pay for each $1 of earnings, about 81 at its current share price. BI's Julie Bort noted yesterday that with GoPro's debut yesterday, founder Nicholas Woodman's entire family became millionaires. As we noted when the company filed for its IPO in April, GoPro is profitable, and revenues have grown steadily since 2012. After a strong debut, it seems investors still want a piece of the company on day two. Google Finance FREE AppDownload
