Even with last week's massive dump of lackluster economic data, volatility remained almost startlingly low. It's worth noting that it's been a while since anyone has said anything about a debt crisis.  Europe is cooling off and the U.S. is watching it's budget deficits improve. This coming week will be relatively light for data. Perhaps, this will give experts some time to ponder the current risks to the markets and the economy. Two big concerns of late are the rising risk of deflation and the stagnating earnings growth expectations. We will discuss each a bit more. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update Analysts are quick to note that despite record high stock prices, earnings are also at record highs, which makes valuations much more reasonable than they were during the highs of 2000 and 2007. However, earnings growth expectations have stagnated. "I am troubled to see that forward earnings has been stuck around its record high of $115 for the past nine weeks," wrote market guru Ed Yardeni earlier this week. "This is the measure of earnings that I believe drives the market." Hedge fund manager Felix Zulauf shares Yardeni's concern. "The problem with currently rising equity markets is not rising prices but the lack of fundamental improvement," wrote Zulauf for Itau BBA.  "Once equity markets discover the emperor has no clothes, they could face a quick and painful adjustment to bring markets in line again with fundamentals."
