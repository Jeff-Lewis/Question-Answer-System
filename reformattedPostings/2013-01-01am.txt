On January 1, just before 2 AM, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to pass a bill that will avert the Fiscal Cliff. The House approved it later that night. The bill is pretty straightforward. Income tax rates will only rise on those making over $400K (liberals wanted $250K, GOP wanted no taxes to rise). Spending cuts will be delayed for 2 months to give the sides more time to address them. So why is the bill 157-pages long? Because when Washington does business and passes a huge bill, there are all kinds of little other pre-existing tax things most Americans have never heard of, but which needed to be extended, that also get into the bill. It's just how it works.       Some might think this is nefarious — that politicians see a huge bill and then sneak in all these random things. The reality is more like these have been around for a while, and every time a big bill comes up about taxes expiring, they get extended too.
