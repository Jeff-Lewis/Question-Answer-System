Sky NewsAt least two people are dead after a suicide bomber detonated a bomb at the entrance of the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital, according to a police official and reported by The Associated Press. Sky News reports that the bomb appeared to have exploded inside the security checkpoint at a side entrance, killing the bomber and a security guard. "There was a huge bang which really shook everywhere," journalist Ilnur Cevik, who was in a car down the street, told Sky News. A Reuters witness saw one wounded person being lifted into an ambulance as police cordoned off the area. The US embassy building is heavily protected while the German and French embassies are nearby. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but Kurdish rebels and Islamic militants are active in Turkey. Turkish news video below.   Google MapsAnkara, Turkey in red FREE AppDownload
