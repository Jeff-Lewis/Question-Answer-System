BBCA kid in Indonesia who digs tin out of mud to make your iPhone.The BBC traced Apple's supply chain back to its roots and found that, among other things, tin used in iPhones comes from dangerous mud mines in Indonesia that employ and kill children and that Chinese people who assemble iPhones work such long hours that they occasionally fall asleep on the job. These discoveries are startling and depressing. At the very least, they should remind us that the true cost of iPhones is much higher than what we, Apple's rich customers, actually pay for them. If this really is news to you, though, you've been living in denial. If you're suddenly appalled at Apple, moreover, you should acknowledge a few things: None of this is to say that some of the truth about the parts and labor that go into your iPhone isn't depressing and horrifying. It is. It is also not to say that Apple shouldn't keep trying to do better. It should. But as you go around wagging your finger at Apple today, be honest about your own contribution to this problem. Today's economy is global. Some of the people who make the products you use every day have jobs and lives that you would consider appalling. You know this. You just fortunately don't have to think about it very often. You are also choosing to continue buying these products, even though you know what goes into them.  That's your choice, not Apple's. So you might as well own it. SEE ALSO: Documentary Expose Lethal Tin Mines Where Kids Get Killed Finding Ore For Your iPhone FREE AppDownload
