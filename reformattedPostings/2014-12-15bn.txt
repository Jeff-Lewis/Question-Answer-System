REUTERS/Gary HershornThe manufacturing report was much worse than expected. The latest Empire State manufacturing report from the New York Federal Reserve came in at -3.6. Expectations were for the reading to come in at 12, up from November's 10.2 reading.  This was the first negative reading for the measure in almost two years. According the Fed's latest report, "Overall, readings for the headline index during the fourth quarter of 2014 mark a significant downshift in activity from the levels seen during the five-month period from May through September." The report said that 19% of respondents said business conditions improved over the last month, while 23% of respondents said conditions worsened. The new-orders index also fell into negative territory, tumbling eleven points to -2.0, and the shipments index fell to -0.2. Labor-market conditions were mixed, with the index for number of employees holding steady at 8.3 and the average-workweek index declining to -11.5. The six-month outlook for business conditions was lower, but "nevertheless conveyed considerable optimism about future business activity." Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said in a note to clients, "In one word: Inexplicable ... Baffling, hard to take seriously ... The is the first sub-zero reading since January 2013, but it flies in the face of almost all the other macro data." Here's the chart: NY Fed      FREE AppDownload
