Jeff Kubina / FlickrPaddy Power — the source for all your Federal Reserve novelty betting — now has a line on when the Fed will begin to taper quantitative easing. The central bank shocked markets last week when it announced it would not reduce the rate at which it is purchasing mortgage bonds and Treasury bills. Most analysts had expected the Fed would reduce the $85 billion a month program by around $10 billion. So market watchers have been left guessing when exactly the Fed will make the taper announcement.
