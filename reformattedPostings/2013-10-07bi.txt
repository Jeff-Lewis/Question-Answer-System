The box was dangling precariously above the street, and authorities shut down 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. The crane is holding a yellow box, not sure what's in it.

Just last year, another crane caused problems for the same building. The top half of the broken crane, damaged by Hurricane Sandy winds, dangled over the street and shut the block down for a week.
