APPope Francis continues to condemn capitalism's excesses. Yesterday, according to an AFP report, Pope Francis ripped into the "slave labor" conditions at a Bangladesh factory whose collapse killed hundreds.  And then this morning, the Pope Tweeted the following: My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost. The Pope isn't a Marxist. And of course John Paul II, Francis' second predecessor, was a champion of capitalism. But massive unemployment is the world's top crisis. With many leaders focused on other topics, it's great that one of the most influential people in the world is giving this the attention it deserves. FREE AppDownload
