Only 28 Republicans joined all but two Democrats in supporting the measure. Within the Republican caucus, it was clear that there was deep division over the measure. Leadership broke with leadership, party chairs broke with other party chairs, and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cast a rare vote in support of the legislation. Here's the list of Republicans that supported the measure: Some of the surprising "no" votes included the fourth-ranking Republican, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), as well as House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who recently helped broker last year's breakthrough budget deal. The final tally was 221-201, with Democrats carrying the vote. Twenty-eight Republicans joined 193 Democrats in voting for the measure. Meanwhile, 199 Republicans and two Democrats voted against it.  FREE AppDownload
