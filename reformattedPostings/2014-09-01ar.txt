Steve Jurvetson / Flickr, CC Apple stock closed at an all-time high on Friday ($102.50) and is set to open at a similar level in Tuesday morning's U.S. trading. It's an impressive track record. But has AAPL peaked? Yahoo There is basically one thing driving the stock right now: The new iPhone 6, expected to be unveiled on Sept. 9 at an Apple media event. Unlike iPhone 5S and 5C, the iPhone 6 will be a genuinely "new" model, coming in a bigger size with a number of new functions. And it will catch Apple users on the cusp of a massive upgrade cycle that will likely make the iPhone 6 a huge best-selling phone.All of that news — and the stuff about the new smartwatch ("iWatch) wearable device coming at the same time — is priced into AAPL right now. That would suggest that once the Sept. 9 event is over, and the market has digested the news, the price might start to fall as investors decide to lock in their gains. Unfortunately, history is no guide. CNBC / YahooYou bet against Apple after a new iPhone at your peril, it seems. But use a different timeframe and the opposite trend appears. CNNOne thing is different this time around: Apple is not just launching a new iPhone, it's going to unveil a smartwatch too. Estimated sales for that watch will depend on its capabilities, and until we get exact details it will be difficult to price in the revenue effect of a new watch. Also new will be iPhone 6's "iWallet" payment system, rumored to include near-field communication technology with Apple's finger printing system to enable users to pay for things with their phones. Investors have generally under-appreciated Apple's potential in mobile commerce and payments, even though it has 1 billion credit cards on file. That's more than Amazon. Again, depending on the mobile payment capabilities of iPhone 6, that could bolt on a massive new set of additional revenue streams from iTunes, the App Store and even Beats. With all those new variables, expect volatility. FREE AppDownload
