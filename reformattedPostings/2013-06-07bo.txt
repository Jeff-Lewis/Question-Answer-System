Library Of CongressIt's a beat! The change in nonfarm payrolls in May's jobs report came in at 175,000, better than expectations for 163,000. Last month's number was revised down to 149,000 from 165,000. The unemployment rate actually edged up from 7.5% to 7.6%. The change in private payrolls was 178,000, which beat expectations for a 175,000 gain. Last month's private payrolls number, however, was revised down to 157,000 from 176,000. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 8,000. Economists were predicting a gain of 4,000. Average hourly earnings were flat in May after rising 0.2% in April. Economists were looking for another 0.2% rise. This is kind of perfect for the market. The job creation was solid, and yet the unemployment rate stays elevated so no pressure on the Fed to tighten soon.
