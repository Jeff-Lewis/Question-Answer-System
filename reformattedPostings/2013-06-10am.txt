If you’re an unemployed, underpaid, morally ambivalent banker or ex-banker who’s fed up with the grunge of Wall Street or the City of London, you could be forgiven for thinking that Edward Snowden was onto a good thing. By most measures, Snowden - the man currently holed-up in a Hong Kong hotel after blowing the whistle on U.S. surveillance systems - was very well paid. Despite not going to university, he earned a salary of $200k (£131k) in 2012 – placing him in the top 5% of American earners. Even better, while he earned this salary Snowden lived and worked in Honolulu, Hawaii. The good news is that financial services professionals who want to work for the security services should have plenty of opportunity to do so – and not just because the CIA wants to ply them with alcohol and extract secret information. Recruiters said the security services and financial services firms need similar skills. “High frequency traders need to analyse large volumes of data,” said Dominic Connor, a quant headhunter at QFS in London. “Hedge funds also have a need for advanced text processing techniques like sentiment analysis so that they can use news feeds to identify trading opportunities.” Snowden was touting his services to the US National Security Agency (NSA) as a contractor via Booz Allen Hamilton. In the UK, the NSA’s equivalent is Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham. Neither Booz Allen Hamilton nor GCHQ were immediately able to respond to requests for comments for this article. This article originally appeared at eFinancial Careers.  Copyright 2013.
