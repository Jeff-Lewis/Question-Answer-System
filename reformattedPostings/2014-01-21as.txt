It's snowing heavily in New York City. The MTA is warning of two-foot snowdrifts and urging commuters to head home early and stay there. Flights are being cancelled by the thousands, including over 30% of flights to and from JFK and LaGuardia airports. The MTA has reduced speed limits on the nine bridges it operates, and the speed limit on all sections of the New Jersey Turnpike has been dropped to 35 mph. According to NYC.gov's snow plowing tracker, most Manhattan streets, along with many in the outer boroughs, have been serviced in the past hour. But traffic is still terrible — everywhere.
