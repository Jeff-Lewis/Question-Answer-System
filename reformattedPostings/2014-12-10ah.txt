Every holiday season in December, legendary economist Gary Shilling mails a bottle of fresh honey to a selected group of people who work in finance.  Shilling is a recreational beekeeper and has an apiary in the back yard of his New Jersey home. He has sent clients, colleagues, friends and experts in finance he likes a honey bottle for years. (Our deputy editor Sam Ro just got one in the mail.) We visited Shilling's home a couple of years ago and he told us all about the challenges and benefits of beekeeping. Produced by Kamelia Angelova &amp; Robert Libetti
