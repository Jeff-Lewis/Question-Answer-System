Pantheon Macroeconomics"The chart shows that the trend in single-family building permits is more or less flat."—Ian ShepherdsonDecember U.S. housing starts and building permits data are out. Starts fell 9.8% to 999,000 units at an annualized pace. November's starts figure was revised up to 1.107 million units annualized from 1.091 million. Building permits fell 3.0% to 986,000 units annualized. November's permits figure was revised up to 1.017 million units annualized from 1.007 million. The consensus estimate of market economists polled by Bloomberg was for a 9.7% decline in starts to 985,000 units annualized. For permits, the consensus estimate was for a 0.3% decline to 1.014 million units annualized. "The December data have slightly undershot, presumably as a result of the severe weather in the second week of the month," says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Looking ahead, the dip in December permits is consistent with a further very modest decline in starts. The underlying trend in permits, which are less volatile than starts, seems now to be more or less flat, consistent with the levelling-off in the trend in new home sales. Housing's contribution to growth is fading; something else — business capex, we hope — needs to take its place."
