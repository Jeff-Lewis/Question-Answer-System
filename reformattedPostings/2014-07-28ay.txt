They believe that the economic freeze caused by the unusually harsh winter will be reversed in a spring economic thaw. They see Q2 growth as a prelude to "3%-plus growth in the second half of the year," writes economist Gary Shilling. In a special report titled 'No Spring Thaw', Shilling warns "the herd is likely to be disappointed." Here's why: The one wild card could be inventory investment according to Shilling. "But barring a big jump in inventories, second quarter real GDP growth was probably a lot closer to 1% than 3%. It could even be a negative number." "A low second quarter real GDP number will kill the conviction that the first quarter drop was only an anomaly and it will spawn agonizing reappraisals for the rest of the year. It could put the Fed on hold at least into 2016 and be great for Treasury bonds. But for stocks, look out below!" This is a message Shilling communicated to Business Insider readers when he offered his "Most Important Chart In The World." See below. We get Q2 GDP at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday.
