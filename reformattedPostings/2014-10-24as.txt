When it comes to beer, there's a great big world out there, and it can seem overwhelming and confusing if you don't know what lies beyond Bud Light (and trust us, a lot lies beyond Bud Light). We put together this handy chart to give even the most novice of beer drinkers a craft beer crash course. We've broken it out by type — lager, wheat, pale ale/IPA, porter, stout, and sour — with a few great examples of each, keeping in mind that there are many more types, and sub-types, of beer than we've included here. Study the graphic below and you'll officially be able to call yourself a beer snob. Skye Gould/Business Insider
