Facebook reported its first quarter financials this afternoon. It beat revenue expectations and slightly missed on profits. Here's the release. Here are the slides. Here are the numbers: **Revenue: $1.46 billion vs $1.44 expected **EPS: $0.12 vs $0.13 expected **Mobile monthly active users: 751 Million, a 54% increase year-over-year. **Ad revenue: $1.25 billion **Mobile ad revenue was $375 million. That's 30% of total revenues, up from 23% last quarter. That's better than the $320 million JP Morgan analyst Douglas Anmuth was hoping for. **March DAU: 665 million. Two things we were looking for in particular were… Mobile ad revenue growth. Facebook performed well here. Usage stats. 665 million DAUs in March is a slight uptick over 618 million in Q4. Facebook hosted an earnings call to go over the numbers at 5 p.m. eastern today.  We covered this call live. Here are our notes: He says its too early to talk about metrics. Paraphrase: "We haven't encourage people to install it through apps, yet." He said 81 of the top 100 grossing iPhone apps are integrated with Facebook. He says the ad unit makes sense to him because on the Web, ads drive people to Web pages. On mobile they should send people to apps. You can't open an app without an install. He says people aren't annoyed by News Feed ads, though Facebook is paying close attention to that. Here are the slides.  Now she's talking about clicks, and how they are not a good way to measure the success of advertisements.&nbsp; She says 99% of people who saw a Facebook ad and then bought the product in a store never clicked on an ad. She's talking about new targeting tools like custom audiences, where an advertiser can target users based on their own databases (for example, a list of customers who have not returned lately). This product got 2X more usage in Q1 as Q4. She says that Facebook can deliver ads to the 12 million people who are likely to buy a car in the next 12 months.&nbsp; He's repeating numbers you can find in the release. Here's the release. Here are the slides. Price per ad were up 3% Desktop revenue was flat w/ last year. Clients do not specify where their ads show up. Facebook just picks where the would perform best. Ebersman says that means desktop is not flat, just because ad revs are flat. Saw a record number of people playing games on Facebook.  Mark emphasizes the same point. &nbsp; Ebersman says RPU was up 21% q/q. He doesn't have anything to say about seasonality. Q4 to Q1 is always that way. Zuckerberg says that Instagram is doing really well, growing quickly. "That's the right focus for them." He says brands are putting photos into Instagram and getting great engagement. They're growing a lot faster now than Facebook was. Sheesh. FREE AppDownload
