REUTER/Steve MarcusThe May jobs report showed the U.S. companies added 217,000 nonfarm payrolls for month. The unemployment rate is unchanged 6.3%. The headline numbers from this report didn't have any curveballs, as it was essentially right in line with expectations.  Expectations were for nonfarm payrolls to grow 215,000, with the unemployment rate ticking up to 6.4%. Private payrolls grew by 216,000. Expectations were for private payrolls to grow by 210,000. The labor force participation rate is unchanged  at 62.8%. Average hours worked were unchanged at 34.5. The year-over-year change in hourly earnings edged up to 2.1% from 1.9% last month. Month-over-month average hourly earnings edged up 0.2%, in line with expectations.  Last month, nonfarm payrolls grew by 288,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.3% from 6.7%.  Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders told BI the reading will serve as confirmation for the Fed that their bond-purchasing taper rate is right where it should be.  "[Payroll growth] was pretty broad — it wasn’t concentrated in one specific industry," she said. "And it wasn’t heavily biased up by labor force participation — the innards of number don't change the fact that it was a pretty decent number." Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth says those who attributed Q1 economic weakness to the U.S.' harsh winter have won the argument. "The robust 217,000 increase in non-far payrolls in May is another illustration that the economy is back on the right track after the weather-related weakness during the winter," he writes. "May's gain followed an even stronger 282,000 increase in April, although we suspect that the latter was boosted a little by the unwinding of the earlier weather distortion." BTIG's Dan Greenhaus observed (via Kelly Evans) that this is the first time we've had four-straight months of 200,o00 jobs growth since 1999. "It didn't happen once during hte last expansion, when average job growth was "just" 184,000." With today's reading, and after nearly seven years, we are back to a new all-time high in overall payrolls. Rob Wile, data from FRED The latest jobs report comes on the heels of unprecedented action from the ECB yesterday, which took interest rates into negative territory.  The economy is also on the cusp of achieving the total employment rate reached in early 2008. The economy needs to add just 113,000 jobs to reach January 2008's record nonfarm payrolls total of 138,365,000. These charts from BI's Rob Wile show how jobs data has changed over the last four years. Rob Wile, data from FRED Rob Wile, data from FRED Rob Wile / FRED Data Rob Wile / FRED Data More to come...
