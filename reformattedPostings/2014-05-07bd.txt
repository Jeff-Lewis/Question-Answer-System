Reuters/ Brendan McDermidDavid EinhornThis week, hedge fund manager David Einhorn showed us what one of the "cool kid stocks" he mentioned in his latest investor letter looks like. It's not pretty. "Cool kid stocks," according to Einhorn, are a pack of stocks that are way overvalued. His hedge fund, Greenlight Capital, is shorting a basket of them and on Monday he presented one, athenahealth to a room full of investors at the 19th Annual Sohn Investment Conference. Athenahealth is a business that provides outsourced administrative services for healthcare providers that, until Monday, enjoyed a stock price of over $125. Einhorn's bull thesis for the stock is for it to fall to $50, his bear case is that it could go to $14. And this presentation has everything: a kooky CEO, superenthusiastic Wall Street analysts, jokes, cartoons, YouTube clips, and more. By the time he was done presenting, the stock was down 7%, at Tuesday's close it was down almost 14%. Wednesday morning the stock started falling; an hour after the open it was down 8%. Carnage. Einhorn was kind enough to share the presentation on Greenlight Capital's website, and allow Business Insider to upload it with his comments here. Enjoy!
