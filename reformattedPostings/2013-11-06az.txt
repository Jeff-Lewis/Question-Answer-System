Eric Gaillard/ReutersTwitter has done everything in its power to be the anti-Facebook, as far as its IPO is concerned. And so on ...  Yet, the end result could end up being somewhat similar for Twitter.  Charlie Gasparino just tweeted that Twitter wants to see the stock open at $40 a share tomorrow when it starts trading. He says a source tells him there is concern the stock will shoot to $80 thanks to strong demand.  The strong demand for Twitter's stock could be so overwhelming that the opening will be delayed as the NYSE tries to handle the load. It might not start trading until the afternoon, says Gasparino. If this happens, and it's all a big if, then it's going to be a crazy mess. Which is what Facebook's first day of trading was.  The big difference, obviously, is that Twitter's mess will be positive since the stock will be skyrocketing.  Here are Gasparino's tweets: FBN NEWS: Twitter eyes $40 open-source worried demand pushes open to $80-source; ipo open cld be delayed till afternoon depending on price FBN NEWS: twitter underwriters hope for a $40 open so retail doesnt get screwed; fear an $80 open contingency plan delay open till afternoon FBN NEWS: Twitter underwriters worried theres too much demand for IPO pushing likely $27 pricing to $80 find out what they plan to do at 320 FREE AppDownload
