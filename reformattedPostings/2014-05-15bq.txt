But the core rose 0.2%, a tenth above the consensus, 0.1%. The core increase was broad-based, with primary rents up 0.3%, owner-equivalent rents up 0.2%, and above-trend increases in new and used vehicle prices, recreation, education and medical services. In addition, airline fares jumped 2.6%. One disappointing core inflation number proves nothing, but note 3-month annualized core is now 2.3%, up from 1.4% in Jan. The upward trend in rents is real, given the tight rental market, and primary rents are now up 3.1% y/y, the biggest gain in exactly five years. OER is lagging behind a bit at 2.6% y/y but it will catch up; together, rents are 40% of the core. In short, core disinflation is  over; rents and profits margins - see the PPI - are a threat.
