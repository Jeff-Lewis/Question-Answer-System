In general, the housing market is recovering at a nice clip. According to the latest Case-Shiller report, house prices in March had the biggest year-over-year gain since April, 2006. But not all cities joined in the fun. New York City was one of just two cities where there was actually a decline. The other was Minneapolis. You can't read too much into one-month blips, but the weakness in New York is consistent. As you can see on the one-year change chart, the gain of 2.6% makes it the worst-performing big city of the entire list. Ongoing weakness when it comes to Wall Street bonuses is surely a major factor. Case-Shiller
