AP On Saturday night, the House of Representatives is likely to pass amendments to the Senate's continuing resolution that include a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and a permanent repeal of the tax on medical devices.  Like a game of ping-pong, this will send the continuing resolution back to the Senate. And it could set up a heavy dose of drama on Monday as a shutdown looms. Here's what is likely to happen next: The "Vitter amendment" would bar lawmakers, Congressional staffers, and administration staffers from receiving federal subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare.  Republicans think that this would give them good political standing in the shutdown battle. They think they would be able to paint Senate Democrats as willing to shut down the government to keep their congressional perks. There are a couple potential problems with this strategy, however. The first is that it's not clear if leadership could get enough Republican votes for the measure. Some will think it doesn't go far enough, as it does not delay or defund Obamacare in any way.  Others might not support it because it would directly hit their pockets and the pockets of their staff. When Vitter tried to bring up his amendment during debate over an unrelated energy-efficiency bill, Politico's Ginger Gibson reported that staffers from Republican offices were reaching out to their Democratic counterparts to get assurance that the amendment would not pass.
