Reuters/Brendan McDermidRosemary Martoma arrives with her husband Mathew at the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in downtown Manhattan in New York, January 17, 2014. Rosemary, who gave up her career as a pediatrician in 2003 to stay home and care for the couple's children and household, thinks that she has a claim to half of the family assets, as she gave up her own career "based on the promise that she would have equal, joint ownership of all income derived from the Defendant's work outside of the household."  Michael Bowe of Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman, a lawyer whom the New York Post called for comment, said that, "If one spouse steals money, the other spouse doesn’t get to keep it just because she quit work." But why not? It's reasonably worth thinking through, even if you don't think she's entitled to any money. These are the facts as we know them: The children are cared for. The house is presumably clean. She has not been accused of any wrongdoing. So why should her assets, earned in the informal (but not illegal) economy, be forfeited? Why should the law punish her and her children for a crime they had no part in?  It's a fair legal (and moral) question, particularly if you believe that one spouse working outside the house and one working on the inside is an equitable way to distribute familial labor.   FREE AppDownload
