Glengarry Glen Ross/Newline Cinema"Glengarry Glen Ross" (1992)Every banker, trader, broker etc. we've talked to will barely glance at their Blackberry, let alone their Bloomberg screens over the next couple of days. Everyone is in holiday mode. So while you're kicking it with your loved ones over BBQ and what not, feel free to relax with one of these movies. They'll serve as a reminder for why you actually love working on Wall Street, and why you can't wait for all the stupid relaxing to be over, obviously. FREE AppDownload
