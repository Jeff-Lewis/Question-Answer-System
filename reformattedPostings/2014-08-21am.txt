The Real DealAlchemy Properties’ offering plan for the condominiums at the Woolworth Building was just approved by the New York Attorney General’s office, and The Real Deal headed over to the AG’s real estate finance bureau to take a peek at it.  The plan reveals that the $110 million penthouse atop the iconic tower — a unit that has been christened the “Pinnacle” — will span 9,400 square feet with just under 500 square feet of outdoor space.  This means Alchemy is asking about $11,700 per square foot for the aerie atop the landmark tower, by far a record for Downtown and one of the priciest listings ever to hit the city.  Overall, the average price for the 34 condo units collectively known as the Woolworth Tower Residences is $4,172 per foot, with a total sellout of $443.7 million. Prices start at $3.9 million for a 1,290-square-foot pad on the 44th floor, suggesting Alchemy feels even more bullish about sales prospects than it did in June, when Bloomberg News reported that the unit was asking $3.5 million.The Real Deal According to the floor plan for the Pinnacle, the penthouse will have three bedrooms, three bathrooms and three powder rooms, as well as a private elevator. The 50th and 51st floors, with more than 4,700 square feet between them, will contain the main living and dining spaces.The Real DealThe 2,456-square-foot 53rd floor will boast a room of more than 1,350 square feet, and the 55th through 58th levels in the cupola will offer a library or media room and an observation deck at the very top.The Real DealThe 51st floor of the Pinnacle penthouseThe Real DealThe 50th floor of the Pinnacle penthouse Alchemy opted to keep sales at the tower in-house, as TRD reported earlier this week.
