You'll hear adherents of technical analysis talk a lot about the 200-day moving average. When the price of a financial asset – like gold, for example – falls below its average price over the last 200 days, it indicates increasingly bearish sentiment toward the asset. The gold price actually dropped below its 200-day moving average back in early February, when it was trading around $1667 an ounce. Today, as Stifel Nicolaus strategist Dave Lutz points out, gold has also broken below its 200-week moving average, which currently hovers around $1435. The price of gold hasn't been below its 200-week moving average since 2001. It's not necessarily a critical level that a lot of traders are watching, but it does illustrate just how bearish sentiment toward the shiny yellow metal has become in recent days.
