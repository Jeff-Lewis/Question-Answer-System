The anecdotes from the reports will be scrutinized carefully as economists attempt to separate short-term weather-related disruptions from the longer-term economic trends. During the month, the eastern U.S. was battered by winter storms while the western U.S. struggled with droughts. Droughts also hit Brazil, sending coffee prices surging. Indeed, temperatures around the world have actually been unusually warm. In terms of the real economy, all eyes will be focused on China, which continues to show signs of slowing. On Saturday, we learned China's official manufacturing PMI hit an 8-month low of 50.2. The unofficial HSBC PMI fell to 48.5, as output and new orders both declined for the first time since July 2013. "Signs become clear that the risks to GDP growth are tilting to the downside," said HSBC's Hongbin Qu. "This calls for policy fine-tuning measures to stabilise market expectations and steady the pace of growth in coming quarters." The global manufacturing PMI climbed to a 34-month high of 53.3. "The manufacturing sector is downshifting from very rapid growth late last year," said JP Morgan's David Hensley. "The global PMI has not quite registered the shift due to weather-related distortions in the US survey, which bounced in February. However, excluding the US, the global PMI is trending lower. The March reading should give a clearer signal of underlying momentum."
