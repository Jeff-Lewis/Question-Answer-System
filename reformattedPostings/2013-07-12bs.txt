This is an oldie, but a goodie from James Montier.  If you haven’t read it then get your life together! “In my previous missive I concluded that investors should stay true to the principles that have always guided (and should always guide) sensible investment, but I left readers hanging as to what I believe those principles might actually be. So, now, for the moment of truth, I present a set of principles that together form what I call The Seven Immutable Laws of Investing. They are as follows: 1. Always insist on a margin of safety 2. This time is never different 3. Be patient and wait for the fat pitch 4. Be contrarian 5. Risk is the permanent loss of capital, never a number 6. Be leery of leverage 7. Never invest in something you don’t understand” Source: GMO The Seven Immutable Laws of Investing By James Montier FREE AppDownload
