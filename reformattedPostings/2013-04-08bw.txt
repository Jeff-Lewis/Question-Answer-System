TechCrunch founder Mike Arrington has finally responded publicly to the "physical abuse" and "rape" claims made against him last week by a former girlfriend, Jenn Allen. Arrington's response is unequivocal: "All of the allegations are completely untrue." Arrington notes, correctly, that these allegations accuse him of serious crimes. He says he has retained a law firm to represent him in legal actions against the "offending parties"--presumably meaning those who, he suggests, have publicly slandered him.  Arrington also says he will provide a longer response and statement soon.
