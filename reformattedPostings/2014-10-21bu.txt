European markets are reacting to rumors that the European Central Bank (ECB) is planning a much wider set of asset purchases (known as quantitative easing) to boost the bloc's lackluster economy.  Here's the scorecard right now: France's CAC 40 is up 1.34% Spain's IBEX is down 1.39% Italy's FTSE MIB is up 2.161% Germany's DAX is up 1.01% Reuters reported that the ECB was considering a much wider purchase of corporate bonds as soon as December. Currently the bank is buying some asset-backed securities and corporate, but there is a much smaller market for those purchases, as shown by Frederik Ducrozet at Credit Agricole. The euro fell more, by nearly 1 cent against the dollar, before rebounding as the rumor was dismissed by other news organizations: Bloomberg The report lifted equities, too; all of the eurozone's major indices were up by more than 1% so far Tuesday before dipping a little.  The ECB is denying that there is anything like this on the agenda, and the Financial Times is reporting from sources that corporate bond purchases are not on December's agenda — at least not yet.
