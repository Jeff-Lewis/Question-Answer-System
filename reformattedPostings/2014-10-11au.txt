Chris Hondros/GettyGoldman Sachs: Where the elite go to get paid.The investment bank Goldman Sachs is one of the most elite institutions on earth.  And most reviled. "'I'm going to Goldman,' is still about as close as it gets in the real world to 'I'm going to Harvard,'" said Michael Lewis, the firebrand financial writer.  The prestige comes with outrageous dollar signs — think "better than half a million dollars in annual compensation, per worker," if you take Businessweek's word for it.  Still, what do you earn if you're not at the top of the Goldman pile?
