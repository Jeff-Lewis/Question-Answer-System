 Three of John Paulson's funds within his hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co., made HSBC's list of the worst-performing funds of 2014. Now that we're in November, you're going to start seeing a lot of these. All three funds — Paulson Recovery, Paulson Advantage, and Paulson Advantage Plus were among the 10 worst performers. We got the list via @LadyFOHF on Twitter; you can check it out below. Paulson runs a $19.1 billion fund overall, and the funds on this list make up only $4.5 billion of that — so it could be worse. But while Paulson's other funds may not have made the list of worst performers, they're not doing that great this year either. Last month, Paulson's biggest stock holding, the pharmaceutical firm Shire, crashed when it announced that it would not complete a merger with AbbVie, another pharma. The stock fell 22% in one day. HSBC via @LadyFOHF Betting on this deal was a huge part of Paulson's merger strategy, and his $9.2 billion merger fund fell 14% in October, Bloomberg reported. Paulson's other strategies include credit and gold. There is about $5.1 billion in the credit fund, which lost 6.8% in October. The rest of Paulson's money (about $1.1 billion) is in his gold fund. The commodity is down slightly, starting the year at $1,201 and currently sitting at $1,196. It peaked on March 13 at $1,392. Last year, Paulson told investors that he may not add to his gold fund.  So there's that.   FREE AppDownload
