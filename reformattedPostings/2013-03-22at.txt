Hamm is splitting with his second wife, Sue Ann Hamm, after he allegedly had an affair. If the couple doesn't have a prenup — and it's not known if they do — she could wind up with half of his 68 percent stake in the company, currently worth $11.2 billion, according to Reuters. That could put Hamm ahead of Rupert Murdoch, who paid a record $1.7 billion in his divorce settlement with ex-wife Anna. They aren't the only uber-wealthy figures who have paid out massive divorce settlements. FREE AppDownload
