REUTERS/US Federal ReserveNew U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (R) joins the Board of Governors attending the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, March 28, 2006.Pay attention: There are three significant economic events happening today. From CalculatedRisk, they are: • At 8:15 AM, the ADP Employment Report for December. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 205,000 payroll jobs added in December, down from 215,000 in November.• At 2:00 PM, the Fed will release the FOMC Minutes for the Meeting of December 17-18, 2013.• At 3:00 PM, Consumer Credit for November from the Federal Reserve. The consensus is for credit to increase $14.2 billion in November. The minutes from the FOMC decision should be very interesting, as that was the taper meeting. FREE AppDownload
