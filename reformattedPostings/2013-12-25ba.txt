"The US economy should sustain a long lasting expansionary cycle of moderate growth, which will make it worthwhile to stay constructive on the S&amp;P 500 for the next couple of years absent a sharp climb in PEs, inflation or interest rates," Bianco writes in his 2014 outlook.  "At this time, we assign a 75% chance to the S&amp;P reaching 1850 or higher at 2014 end." Bianco suggests a "very selective" investment strategy including technology, aerospace, insurance, chemical, and biotechnology stocks. Here are Deutsche Bank's favorite big cap stocks (market cap great than $10 billion, PE on 2014 EPS greater than 20, 2014 EPS growth greater than 5%, and net debt/market cap less than 30% for the non-financial companies).
