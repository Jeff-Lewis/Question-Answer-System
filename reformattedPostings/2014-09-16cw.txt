REUTERS/Sang TanBank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks to the audience after his public speech on "One Mission. One Bank. Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom" at the Cass Business School in London March 18, 2014. High household debt levels could be one of the main reasons the 2008 financial crash became the longest and deepest recession since the 19th century, according to a report by the Bank of England. The report provides strong evidence that consumers with high debts panicked in the wake of the crash, fearing the effects of recession on their personal finances. If this group cut their spending by more than the average, it could account for two-fifths of the 5% collapse in private consumption after 2007, the report says. The findings support a clampdown by regulators on high loan to income mortgages, which became more widespread following a steep rise in house prices, especially in London and the south-east. Officials at the Bank believe maintaining low rates of private debt relative to national income will help protect the UK from severe recession in the event of another financial crash. Britain's household debt soared higher than 160% of GDP in 2007, from 100% in 2000. It has since fallen below 140% before starting to climb again. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that by 2016-17 it will have reached its previous peak and will continue to rise.
