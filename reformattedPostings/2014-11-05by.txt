Analysts Robert Sluymer and Jonathan Golub believe valuations for small-caps have gone from contraction to expansion. Since October 10, small-cap sectors have returned 11%, compared to 6.0% for large caps, they note. The S&amp;P 600 and Russell 2000 may break their 2014 highs of 1213.55 and 695.71 respectively if the upside trend continues over the coming weeks, Sluymer noted. Small caps will see earnings growth of 22% over the next 12 months, versus 8% for large caps, they forecasted. "We believe that stronger growth and attractive PEG (P/E to Growth) ratios are supportive for small caps," Golub wrote. Sluymer and Golub identified 16 attractive small-cap stocks rated "Outperform" by RBC analysts. FREE AppDownload
