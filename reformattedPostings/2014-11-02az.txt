 Venture capitalist Peter Boyce II weighed in on whether to get an MBA in the second part of his interview with OneWire CEO Skiddy von Stade. Boyce has founded businesses without the prestigious degree. In high school, he created his first company fixing computers after helping his mom with hers. In college, he cofounded two groups that helped bring young entrepreneurs together. And today he's an early-stage investor in student startups through Rough Draft Ventures, a company he cofounded. So what does he think about investing in an MBA? "I almost feel like I'm getting my MBA on the go right now in a lot of ways. A lot of the programs are fantastically powerful, especially for helping folks understand "how do you take a company from 50 to 100 people internationally?" So that management skill is not easy to necessarily do if you've never run a company that size before. So I think it's an interesting compliment or supplement for someone that operates a company. I think for myself, being in venture [capital], you get to see early stage entrepreneurs go through those different phases and go through those different steps, and so I almost feel like I've gotten kind of a taste of it."  Watch the full interview above and subscribe to the Open Door series to receive upcoming interviews.
