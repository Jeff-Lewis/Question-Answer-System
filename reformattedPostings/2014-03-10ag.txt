AUSTIN, Texas — If you want an instant way to turn your bitcoins into cash or vice versa, a Bitcoin ATM is one of your best bets. The Bitcoin ATM syncs with your Bitcoin wallet, letting you instantly transfer your cash to bitcoins or withdraw your bitcoins as cash.  We got to check out one of the devices at the South By Southwest Interactive conference. It was run by an independent Bitcoin agent named Mike Piri. Piri owns a company called My Local Bitcoin ATM and runs two of the machines in Austin. He takes a small fee (in Bitcoin, of course) of each transaction people make. The device itself is made by a company called Robocoin, which sells the ATMs to people for a whopping $25,000. Piri has one of his machines in a local bar here in Austin and another in a coffee shop. (He took the one out of the coffee shop this week so he could show it off at the conference.)
