FoursquareWe recently did a report on where some of Wall Street's top hedge fund managers went to college. While there's a belief that in order to get a Wall Street job you need to graduate from an Ivy League with a 3.5 GPA, we learned that a bunch of the most successful hedge funders went to non-Ivy League schools.  So we were curious where some of Wall Street's biggest names went to high school. We decided to comb through alumni lists of prep schools to find ones with big name Wall Street alums.  Of course, you don't have to go to one to be successful on the Street just like you don't have to graduate from an Ivy League either.  We've included our round up in the slides that follow.  FREE AppDownload
