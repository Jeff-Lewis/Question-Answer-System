Flickr/Jason H. SmithThe March Chicago PMI survey is out. The headline index fell to 52.4 from 56.8 last month. Economists were expecting a much slighter moderation to 56.5. The production sub-component plummeted to 51.8 from 60.2, marking its lowest reading since September 2009. The new orders sub-component also fell sharply – to 53.0 from 60.2 – the largest monthly drop since May 2011. However, any reading above 50 on the index still indicates expansion, which means manufacturing activity in the Midwest still grew at a decent clip in March (just not as fast as in February).
