Schwarzman, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of the Blackstone Group.A unit of Blackstone Group, the world's largest private equity firm, essentially paid a company to purposely miss a debt payment in order to profit on credit default swaps (CDS), Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle, Mary Childs &amp; and Julie Miecamp report. It was a brilliantly canny deal that guaranteed Blackstone would make money. CDSs, a kind of insurance against defaults and missed debt payments, were one of the main culprits in the global financial meltdown. Regulators have tried to make them more transparent, with limited success. Here's how the deal went down, according to Bloomberg: Earlier this year, the Blackstone unit, GSO, bought bonds of and CDSs against a company called Codere, which operates betting parlors and race tracks in Europe and Latin America.  Then the Blackstone unit (along with another firm) took over a separate 100 million euro revolving Codere credit facility from several different megabanks. Among the conditions of that deal: if Codere paid an interest payment due Aug. 15 (with a 30-day grace period), it would have to repay the entire loan at once. But that was never going to happen, because the Blackstone unit (along with another firm) then lent Codere $35 million to cover the cost of missing the payment. As agreed, Codere paid the loan two days late, and the CDSs were triggered. The reporters estimate the Blackstone unit netted at least $15.6 million off the deal. And it's totally legal, since both sides agreed to the terms. Codere ends up benefiting too, since more banks will now be interested in lending to it.   Click here to read the full report at Bloomberg » FREE AppDownload
