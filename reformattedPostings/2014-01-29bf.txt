REUTERS/Jason Reed We've just seen three unexpected rate hikes from emerging market central banks. First was India, then Turkey and finally, South Africa. While these rate hikes have moved markets, Bob Savage writes in his latest Track Research note that "the key driver today isn’t the failed reaction of the TRY to rate hikes from the central bank but more the contagion of the FOMC continuing to taper its QE." Instead he thinks investors will be watching money flows in the coming days instead of rate decisions "to really determine what is safe and what is not." Meanwhile he says there are three ways that emerging market economies can fight off potential outflows from further Fed tapering. We get the latest FOMC meeting announcement at 2 p.m. ET today.
