Screenshot via Bloomberg TVGold has been taking a battering all day. Gold is off 8.5% to $1,373.80 an ounce. Commodities guru Jim Rogers isn't buying gold yet. He told Business Insider there were four key things driving the sell-off. Rogers said he hasn't hedged his positions at the moment. "I have repeatedly babbled about $1200-1300, but that is just because that would be a 30-35% correction which is normal in markets," he told Business Insider. "But I am a hopeless market timer/trader." Rogers said he expects gold prices to fall further for the "foreseeable future" but expects "gold to eventually go higher over the decade."
