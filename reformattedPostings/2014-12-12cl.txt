Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, grew 15.8 percent in the first 11 months of the year from the same period last year, in line with forecasts but easing slightly. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output to rise 7.5 percent and retail sales to rise 11.5 percent. Fixed-asset investment for the January-November period was seen up 15.8 percent. Output grew 7.7 percent in October and retail sales rose 11.5 percent, with January-October fixed-asset investment up 15.9 percent from the same period a year earlier. China's economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, despite a series of stimulus measures. The central bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates on Nov. 21 and analysts see further easing in coming months as Beijing tries to avert the risk of a sharper slowdown.
