Nick DeWolfWith all the interest surrounding Hong Kong in the past few days as pro-democracy protests continue to erupt, it's easy to forget how much change the city has seen in the past 50 years. Hong Kong has undergone major growth, moving from a small city to one filled with massive skyscrapers, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Photographer Nick DeWolf captured daily life in Hong Kong during a trip to Asia in 1972. His photos show just what it was like in a time when the Pearl of the Orient was still transitioning into what it is today. DeWolf has shared his photos with us below.
