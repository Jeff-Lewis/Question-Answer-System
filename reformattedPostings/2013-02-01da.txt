en.wikipedia.orgThe World Bank recently slashed its outlook for global growth in 2013 to 2.4 percent and 2014 to 3.1 percent.  It also unveiled its lackluster 2015 forecast: 3.3 percent. "While diminished, downside risks to the global economy persist and include a stalling of progress on the Euro Area crisis, debt and fiscal issues in the United States, the possibility of a sharp slowing of investment in China, and a disruption in global oil supplies," they write. The organization's new report, Global Economic Prospects, provides outlooks for the individual economies it follows. The laggards include economies that rely on tourism like Belize and Jamaica.  It also includes nations struggling with corruption and crime. But for the most part, they are the major developed economies like the U.S., Japan, and the members of the European Union. (For the purposes of this report, the EU is considered one economy.)
