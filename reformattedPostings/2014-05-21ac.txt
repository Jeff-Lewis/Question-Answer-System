AP PhotoHSBC China flash PMI climbed to a five-month high of 49.7 in May. This beat expectations for a rise to 48.3. This is up from 48.1 in April. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. "The improvement was broad-based with both new orders and new export orders back in expansionary territory,” said Hongbin Qu, HSBC chief economist for China, in a press release. “Disinflationary pressures also eased over the month and output prices increased for the first time since November 2013.” The manufacturing output index hit a four-month high of 50.3 and is now in expansionary territory.  The employment sub-index however fell further and at a faster rate to 47.3, “which implies that this month's uptick in sentiment has not yet filtered through to the labour market,” Qu said. Beijing announced a mini-stimulus to help stabilize growth. That along with lower borrowing costs have helped business sentiment. But the cooling property market continues to pose a risk.
