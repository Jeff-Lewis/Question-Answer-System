The U.S. Congress claims that Apple set up an international paper-based subsidiary called Apple Operations International to hide more than $30 billion in profit from tax collectors between 2009 to 2012. Congress says this company has "no physical presence" and "no employees."* But that doesn't appear to be true!* Reuters photographer Michael MacSweeney says he has found an office in Ireland used by Apple Operations International, at least to collect mail. And he has a photograph to prove it! So, according to Reuters, this building is where you can send stuff to the Apple legal entity that generates the $30 billion of profit and is safely out of the reach of greedy U.S. tax collectors: REUTERS/Michael MacSweeneyThe $30 billion company known as "Apple Operations International."*UPDATE: Gordon Trowbridge from Senator Carl Levin's office reached out to reiterate the Senate's position that Apple Operations International has no employees and no physical presence: It’s incorrect to say AOI has employees or a physical presence at that location. Apple has told the subcommittee that AOI has no employees, and that its Cork mailing address is just that – a mail drop – and that AOI itself has no physical presence there (or anywhere else, I believe).  Apple has a whole network of Irish subsidiaries, most based at its Cork campus. It says it has about 4,000 employees in Ireland, but all of them are employed by other Apple entities, not AOI. SEE ALSO: Apple's Tax-Dodging Techniques Are Quite Spectacular FREE AppDownload
