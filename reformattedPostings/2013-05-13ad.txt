The S&amp;P 500 inched up to close at yet another all-time record high. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the current leg of the rally is the lack of volatility. "This past Friday, May 10, 2013 marked 176 days since a 5%+ pullback in the S&amp;P 500, tying the record for stretches without a pullback in this 50-month-old bull market [Figure 1], so it may be close," said LPL Financial's Jeff Kleintop.  Today, the S&amp;P 500 squeaked higher, extending that streak to 177 days.
