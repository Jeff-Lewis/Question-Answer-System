Sprint on Monday announced earnings for last quarter. It posted a loss of $0.19 per share and announced that it would cut 2,000 jobs. The stock is down about 6% in after-hours trading. Net operating revenue for the quarter was almost $8.5 billion. The operating loss was $192 million. Sprint also lost 272,000 post-paid subscribers. The carrier has been going through an odd transition lately as it faces increased competition from T-Mobile, a smaller rival. AT&amp;T and Verizon are also growing and doing well. Sprint attempted to buy T-Mobile this summer but abandoned those plans after determining the deal would not be approved by US regulators. Instead, Sprint's then-CEO Dan Hesse stepped down, and Marcelo Claure got the job. Now Sprint and T-Mobile are battling to become the nation's third-largest wireless carrier. (AT&amp;T and Verizon are so big that it would be tough for T-Mobile or Sprint to catch up anytime soon.)
