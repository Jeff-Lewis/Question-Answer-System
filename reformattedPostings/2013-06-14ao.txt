U.S. stocks are going nowhere but down today. The S&amp;P 500 is now trading at 1625, down 0.7% from yesterday's close and 15 points off this morning's high of 1640. The dollar-yen exchange rate, which has been closely correlated with the S&amp;P 500, tanked earlier today, briefly falling below ¥94 to a low of ¥93.98 as the yen strengthened. However, it's since stabilized around ¥94.20. Stocks continue to fall, nonetheless. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is rising and, at 2.14%,  is now only 1 basis point lower from yesterday's close. Gold (up 0.7% at $1387 an ounce) and oil (up 1.3% at $97.99 a barrel) are both trading sideways this afternoon. The chart below shows today's move in S&amp;P 500 futures.
