REUTERS/Jim Young Bill GrossPIMCO's Total Return Fund, the bond fund spearheaded by  CIO Bill Gross, just saw its 15th-straight month of outflows, according to new Morningstar data. The fund's losses totaled $830 million, or 0.4% of June-ending assets of $225 billion, Morningstar said. Total assets in the fund at the end of July are now down to $223 billion. Marketwatch reports the fund returned negative 0.5%, underperforming the benchmark Barclays Aggregate bond fund, which returned negative 0.3%. The fund has underperformed 72% of its peers through July. However, it's topped 87% of its peers in the past three months. And as Bloomberg recently reported, nine of PIMCO's 15 largest mutual funds are beating at least 75% of peers YTD. "Gross has been undermined this year by bets on shorter-term debt, trailing 89% of his peers in July," Bloomberg's Mary Childs and Charles Stein wrote.  FREE AppDownload
